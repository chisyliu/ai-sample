"OXO Tot 4-Piece Feeding Set, Green",Meals can be quite stressful in our house but now they are a little less messy.  My daughter likes to throw things including her dishes.  With these she has a much harder time since the entire base is rubber.  The side lip around the plate that is removable helps keep her food in the plate and get it onto the spoon.Great dish set even though it's pricey.Highly recommend!,5
"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red",When shopping for an umbrella stroller we wanted something compact and sturdy. We also didn't want to spend a lot of money for a stroller our child will outgrow in about 30lbs or so. This stoller meets our expectations and the price is great. I have read complaints about not being able to lock the stroller but if you are standing behind it there is a small red latch next to the pocket that locks the stroller in place.,5
"Skip Hop Moby Bathtub Elbow Rest, Blue","Recently purchased this, so I've only used it a handful of times so far. Can't complain about much as of yet. It does the job. We've used it on the kitchen sink and on the bathtub so far. Easily switches between the two. The majority of the padding is on the top (for mom/dad's elbows) but the neoprene sides are also very handy for extra protection for baby's head/hands/feet/body in case of accidental contact with the edge of the sink/tub it covers.Haven't really used the zipper compartment. The rest has three suction cups to attach to the tub/sink walls (one on one side, two on the other). Dries out quickly (we toss it in the front loading washing machine on 'drain' and its done).Very pleased, will recommend to others.",4
Cloud b Mimicking Monkey,The &#34;white noise&#34; function on this thing is so quiet that we had to send it back.  My baby requires LOUD white noise to sleep through the night and this guy wasn't even close.,1
Evenflo Single Breast Pump,I used this product because my son would not latch and I had to pump.  This product works well for the price.  It may be a bit noisy but it works just fine.  I have had it for 3 months now and it is still giving the same resourcefulness as when I used it the first day.  I needed to express milk for my son and this product helps me to do that.,4
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","Mt granddaughter always cried when we put her in the carseat,until we put this in they crying has stopped . It's soft and comfortable. I was sold when the crying stopped. Excellent product.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","This is the best bottles ever build.  My baby, (3 month old) is happy besides is BPA free..  I recommend it.",5
"Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White",So far I have only used this for feeding but it helps to provide support to my arms when feeding.  Cannot wait to start using it to prop up baby.,4
"Chicco Smart Support Backpack, Red","No problems with it.  Rugged construction.  The windshield is really great.  Very sturdy, and easy to put together. does an awesome job no matter what the terrain.",5
"BRICA UV Alert Window Shade, Gray","I was looking for shades for the back (side) windows in our Jeep and these are a great fit. My husband said they were very easy to install.  There is a button at the top to press for retracting the blinds. Couldn't be more easy and convenient. They look nice and neat, too.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush, Blue",I don't know why would it matter that a brush is made with BPA plastic unless you are planning on boiling it. But this product is great. It is lasting 6 months so far.,5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof SS 7 Ounce Sippy Cup with Handles, Pink, 6 Months","For parents who are concerned about chemicals in what  has become traditional baby products, this is a great non-bpa replacement for the plastic sippy cup. My daughter is particularly fussy about the recipient she's drinking out of and I was very surprised she accepted this in no time, as I involved her in opening up the Amazon box and be surprised by what she got.The only slightly negative thing about it is that it often takes several attempts before you can properly fix the spout in the lid hole. Once it's done it's totally leak proof.",4
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,This monitor works beautifully. It is so clear that we can hear the baby breathing while he is sleeping. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good baby monitor.,5
Tobbles,"MY Grandson loves this toy when he is not playing with it  i am playing with it, colors are vibrant and it is quite amazing how they balance on each other  Another Pulu...Guess what NO Batteries either...",5
'The Insulated Sippy' by Eco Vessel Insulated Stainless Steel Sippy Cup - 10 Oz - Hudson Blue - 10 oz - Container,Pretty.  1 yr old has not gone for using this odd nipple as a sippy for longer than 20 seconds.  I'm sure he just needs to get used to it and our personal transition is going rocky because I introduced it after 9 months.,4
"Luvable Friends Flannel Fitted Crib Sheet, Yellow Circle",I love these sheets for our cold Michigan winter nights.  Great fit and soft too.  They hold up well after repeated washes.  Would recommend.,5
Beaba 3-Stage Baby Bottle Training Sippy Cup - Pink,"My daughter has loved this cup since we bought it over a year ago -- it's always been her favorite, first with the nipple, and now with the regular top.  Even though she can drink out of a normal cup by now (she's nearly two), she still prefers this one.  And if you put the lid on tightly it doesn't pop off.  They key (and this took me a while), is to make sure you press down firmly on the top and make sure it's down on all sides (this sounds more complicated than it is).  If you do that, no problems.  Promise -- ours has been dropped many times...  Also, it's dishwasher safe for real, unlike a lot of others that degrade over time.  This has gone through literally hundreds of times, and still looks brand new.  Totally worth the extra money -- you'll love it.",5
Hello Kitty Large Collage Pink Childs Backpack,This is perfect for any Hello Kitty fan.  She loves it!  It was delivered on time and in perfect condition.  It's a little bigger than I expected but she will grow into it.  It's great!,5
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Snow","I was delighted to receive the bundle me for a baby gift but was quickly disappointed when I realized the car seat straps thread through the ""fleece.""  This can potentially cause problems with getting a snug fit and can increase compressibility in an accident. There should be nothing between your baby and the car seat except for a layer of clothing.  I liked the idea of having a built in blanket but did not want to compromise the safety of my child.After examining the Bundle Me I decided to ""cut out"" the back panel where the straps thread through.  This allowed me to place the cover in the seat without worrying about having to thread the straps through the thick fleece  Now, my baby is positioned directly on the carseat but is surrounded by the Bundle Me.  It truly is a perfect fit, the straps are not hindered by the bulky fleece and I am no longer concerned about compressiblity.It was an easy enough modification and I wish the manufacturer would adopt this change.",4
SOHO 4 in 1 Soft Kahki Diaper bag,"I loved the design, and I still do, but the size is weird, very square, and seems to be cheaply made.",2
"C.R. Gibson Loose-Leaf Memory Book, Baby Bots",This book is awesome! It has pages for everything u could possible want to record. I love the fact that u can add pages along the way and page protectors to put memorable items in.,5
"Delta 48 Piece Nursery Storage Set, Beige","Great starter set for a new baby's closet.  Hangers are the perfect size for baby clothes and the 3 small bins fit into the hanging organizer like drawers.  Color is neutral and great.  The dividers and stickers were kind of worthless in my set though.  Most of the stickers wouldn't peel off the sheets, so they ripped and had to go in the trash.  It didn't really matter though - the dividers just spin around the closet rod, they aren't weighted, so even if you manage to get the stickers onto them, chances are slim the label will actually be visible.  Not a big deal.  For the price, everything else was great!  If I need dividers I can pick those up elsewhere.  All in all this was a great purchase, and I'm pretty picky.",4
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Fine when it works, which is for about 2 months.  I have gone through three of them, too bad they aren't more long lasting.  The sounds are pretty good, the nightlight is useful, and the projector works well mostly (hard to keep focused well).  But the killer issue is that it just stops working after 1-2 months.",1
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"I bought this pay yard for my four-month old puppy and I am very satisfied.  It's sturdy and safe.  I like the fact that it can be made into a circular play yard or protective gate.  It hasn't tipped over once, despite a 30 lb puppy jumping up and putting his paws on the top.  I especially like the gate latch and how it opens to the inside.  No bolting!  Definitely a quality purchase.  Arrived on time and great price!",5
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","Our 6 month old loves her """"Wubbzy""""!  I would highly recommend it for any youngling who prefers a pacifier. It is nicely weighted so it sits on baby's chest and is easily accessible.",5
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),Our baby had terrible gas and reflux. These bottles helped reduce the air going to her belly. They have multiple parts but you get used to assembling and cleaning them quickly.,5
"Sassy Grow Up Cup No Spout, No Spill Design 12 oz - 18 Months","I ordered these cups to transition my son to a regular cup from a sippy cup.  They are colorful and they hold enough liquid to satisfy him.  I do have to say they do leak of you turn them upside down, but then again maybe I did not tighten it enough.  They are easy to clean and fun to drink out of.  My daughter who is 7 really enjoys them and they are fun enough that even I drink out of them!  For a set of two you will be pleased",5
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,"There's another seller asking 35 or so for it, or you can check online auction places. This sellers price is completely insane and ticks me off. Freaking robbery, and you should be ashamed of yourself.The bathseat however, is great. It's most definitely not worth THIS sellers asking price. But it's worth it's ORIGINAL selling price which is between 20 and 30'ish.",5
"Sealy Natural Cotton Crib Mattress Pad, 52&quot; X 28&quot;","This mattress pad was exactly what I was looking for. It arrived on time and I was excited to give my son a softer place to sleep. After a wash, an air dry, and an air spin in the dryer it was nice and fluffy. The magic ended as soon I put it on the mattress. It was not a tight stretch at all but as I pulled it over the third corner, it ripped. The side stretchy material tore away from the topper. I thought at first I might be able to stitch it back together but the tear just keeps getting bigger. I assume since I already washed it, it is nonreturnable and we will have to find a different product. Bummer.",1
"aden + anais 2 Pack Muslin Burpy Bib, Princess Posie","These bibs are super soft and absorbent. They provide great coverage. I like that they use snaps instead of velcro. The snaps on one of my bibs broke, so I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement bib. Great customer service!",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"We put this over the baby's crib, filled it with toys, and put a video baby monitor in it too. I want to train him early that someone is always watching and listening to his conversations. Welcome to America, Baby.",5
"Safety 1st Sweet Wonder Play Yard, Cubes",Happy with the product. Durable and of better quality than others I've seen. Highly recommended.,4
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,My husband thought this was a well made high chair it was easy to put together because everything went it its respective place.  The straps and the seating are easy to adjust and my grandson loves it!,5
Philips AVENT Isis iQ Duo Twin Electronic Breast Pump,"After reading many reviews, I decided to purchase this pump instead of the medella pump in style.  I was a little unsure because I couldn't find as many reviews on the avent pump because it was fairly new.I am very happy with my decision.  I get 6-8 oz in only 10 minutes.  The bag is very roomy and looks great.  I thought it was a little pricy, but I purchased mine on ebay brand new in sealed box and saved over $100.Some cons are that you need to wash and sterilize the horn and attachments every time you pump, so I tried to purchase an extra set to rotate.  WOW EXPENSIVE!!!  It was going to cost me $130 for the extra set.  Almost half the price of the entire pump.  So I have been using the medella quick clean wipes to clean my pump parts at work.  They work out great!  Avent also needs to make a battery pack or car adaptor.  When you travel or for just a day trip, you must have access to electric!  I just took a weekend shopping trip and it was a big hassel to always find a place to plug the pump in.",5
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack",I was given one pack of these bottles at a gift at my shower. They looked really confusing to me but thought I would give them a try. My baby almost never had gas. They cut the air right out of the bottle and he loved the shape of the nipple. These are a must have especially with a colic or fussy baby!!,5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",I like that the bottles are BPA Free - I feel good about using them to feed my baby.  But I don't like dealing with the extra vent parts - it's just more parts to wash.  I tried using the bottles without putting the vent in and the nipples just collapse - so you have to use the vents.  But overall I like these bottles.,3
Dream Baby Door Catches 2 pack,"Work well, and they are easy to install. Attractive looking. If I need more catches, these would be the ones that I would order. Price could be lower though",5
beginning... by Maclaren Connecting Massage Oil,Excellent but a little fragrant. Works great! And is perfect for baby massage. Bottle is easy to grip  And doesn't pour out too fast. Excellent,5
"Dr. Brown's Standard Dishwashing Basket, Polypropylene","So glad I bought this! It fits all of the pieces perfectly and gets them cleaner than the other baskets I've used. It hold parts for 3 bottles and takes up less room than other baskets while ensuring all of the parts are washed properly. I highly recommend buying this if you have Dr. Brown's bottles, as it makes washing them in the dishwasher much more convenient and does a much better job than other baskets (the straws don't hang down, the tops don't flip over, and nothing overlaps).",5
OsoCozy Better Fit Unbleached Prefolds (Infant 4x8x4 Fits 6-16 lbs.) - Dozen,"Excellant absorbency (you should boil them before use) and they have lasted through probably hundreds of washes.  They are soft for baby, too.",5
PumpEase Classic Collection hands-free pumping bra - Verry Cherry - M,"As a new mom I dreaded pumping each day... it just wasn't pleasant for me.  Buying this PumpEase bra made it much more bearable.  I don't even have to think about the pumping happening... I can instead use my free hands/free time to read my Kindle, return email, or just chill out.  Sizing chart was true to size.  I've been using it daily for over a month with no stretching and no complaints!",5
Colgate Mattress 13 x 27 x 2 Oval Replacement Mattress Pad,probably lucky they are out of stock on this item.  the mattress is a thin piece of foam covered by plastic - all for $48.00.  i expected a little more for my money.  really SAD!,1
"Kiddopotamus Dreamsie Sleeper with Sleeves Microfleece Small, Blue","This immediately became a favorite with my daughter.  She puts the baby in it every night, washes beautifully (every day).  Highly recommend this product.  Everything was shipped quickly and arrived in great condition.The only problem I had was, it did not come in pink in small thru the website.  This was for a first girl, but fortunately, no one minded it was blue because of the warmth and convenience each night.",5
"Boon Gnaw Multi-Purpose Teething Tether, Grape/Kiwi","It's ok by my judgement but my twins LOVE this. They fight for it. Even though you're supposed to put a biscuit or teether thing in the green netting portion, my twins like to bite on it just as is. It's a little dangerous when they fling it around since it's a bit long because it's reallymeant to be snapped onto something but my twins pull it right off when snapped onto their clothes.",3
Snug Square Play Mat (Cream-Espresso),"Most comfortable play mat for baby, even has space where I can lay and play. Very comfortable! Makes me want to fall asleep on the floor. I nominated this for a Cribbie. A must have for any baby from tummy time and beyond!",5
Long-Range Vibrating Baby Monitor,"I just wanted to recap what the ""toy enthusiast from MA"" said below:""I did however find a company that actually made me a new rechargable battery. The company is called Battery World ([...]) The battery was about $13.00 US and it worked great. So for all you Moms who love this monitor but need a battery here is your solution. ""We also own the original version of this monitor, the battery died after about 2 years of use, and we have ordered the replacement battery from Battery World - $15 US. Keep up the good work Battery World!",4
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","This is an absolutely brilliant invention. It is by far the simplest and easiest-to-operate of any child-proofing door solution I've ever seen. No fiddling with doorknobs or intricate catches, and it doesn't leave any scratches or dents in the door or frame. And it's much, much less expensive than other solutions that allow for airflow.Place it out of the reach of infants and toddlers but within the reach of small children to allow the older kids to get in and out without risking the baby falling down the stairs or smashing fingers in the doorjamb. It's also great for keeping the cat out of the bedroom and guest room&#8212;or in the room with the cat tree if we have workers coming in and out of the house over an extended period.As a super-awesome bonus, it also allows for decent airflow.Children with separation anxiety may be comforted by being able to see their parents through the modest gap.Seriously, the inventor deserves a medal for this.",5
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet",I have trouble putting my baby to sleep every night without rocking her in my arms for at least half an hour. Until I purchased this product when my baby girl was 3 months old and have been using it ever since. We just hang it on the crib and turn the mobile projector on every night. The first 10 - 15 minutes she would be talking to the animals until she gets tired and falls asleep by herself. i strongly recommend this product to anyone. This product is an excellent purchase! It helps your baby train to sleep by herself. One suggestion for parents who would purchase this product is when you hang it on the crib dont put your baby directly under the projector. Place it where the baby would be looking down a little bit because it somehow forces her eyes to close and make her fall asleep  faster.,5
CNC-KE Taby Tray White,"The car tray is great.  My grandson loves it.  It allows him to drive his cars while we are traveling.  He loves the cupholder, too.  I like the ridge around the edges that keep things from rolling off the trays.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This is a great litle learning toy and night light. The display of the moon and constellations on the ceiling was very clear. We gave it to a 4 year old and she was delighted. She gave us a big smile big hugs.,5
"Safety 1st Alpha Elite 65 Infant Car Seat, Rachel","This is a great car seat for the baby. It is set up so as your child grows, it accommodates for his/her size. The material is top notch in quality. I couldn't find any flaws in it. The cushioning is comfortable with sufficient padding. It also fit easily into the van as well as the sedan. I think this is a great product and I give it five stars.",5
"NUK Ultra Thin Breast Pads, Pack of 2, White, 120-Count",I bought these because they were cheaper then the pads I normally buy. I regret not spending the extra $2! I woke up this morning with a soaked Tshirt because they had leaked. I'm going to stick with my normal brand.,1
Boon Flair Harness/Buckle,Exactly what I needed. I wanted light nuetral 5 pt. harness straps to attach to a wooden high chair I'd salvaged from a thrift store. These do the trick nicely and work well.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My toddler LOVES his turtle! It's a huge comfort for him while falling asleep. It's especially great because it turns off on its own after a while, so he doesn't require a night light all night long. Great product! Super bright!",5
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White",This lasted outside through 4 NE winters.  I just replaced with same brand/type of gate. Use to keep Min-Pin in either front or back yard.  He does not jump on it.  Not the strongest gate for a small child or a dog that would try to jump against it.  But is just what we needed and held up outside longer than we thought it would!  I recommend that Amazon sell the extensions for this gate also.,5
"Munchkin 12 Ounce Mighty Grip Toddler Sports Bottle, Colors May Vary",Does not spill. It is a little hard for my toddlers to actually suck the water out but they are getting the hang of it.,4
"American Baby Company 3-Piece Portable/Mini Crib Set with Large Espresso Dot, Blue","Keeping in mind I haven't washed this yet..This set is so soft and way cuter than it looks online. I noticed some fuzz (from the blue parts) hanging on to the brown parts of this, but a swipe of the hand takes it off quickly.Everything fits, but the fitted sheet sides could fit better. I have a mattress that is less than 3 inches wide and the sides creep up a tad, though it's not bad enough to worry about. I also thought it was strange that the ties on the bumpe aren't where the four corners are but instead end up a rail or two after the corners, but maybe that's just installer error (it's been awhile since I've had cause to put a bumper on a crib!)Considering how difficult it is to find a bedding set for a mini crib, I would gladly recommend this to anyone looking for such an item. I would probably purchase this for a regular crib if they came in that size if that says anything!",4
"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Froggy","It is such a cute potty.  But for a boy who has that certain type of equipment, it doesn't protect your floors or walls.  Definitely needs a front cup for a boy.  But I also have a girl, so works nice for her.  Just wish it could accomodate me for a boy.  But it is cute  just not efficient.",3
"green sprouts Stacking Cup Set, Colors may vary",Our LO loves these a lot!!  They go with us everywhere as a must have toy. She loves to take the apart and chew on them too.  These can be used in the water which is a great use too.,5
"OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Pink","This wipes dispenser is the cats pajamas!!!  Works great, there is an internal weight that keeps the wipes from bunching up and we only get one wipe at a time!!!  This is our 5th child and don't know how we got by without this all of these years,this thing is a game changer.  The lid has a good quality rubber seal that keeps the wipes moist and they never dry out.  The lid is spring loaded and opens with just a press of the lid keeping your other hand free which is great for those times when changing diapers is like trying to subdue an angry Wildebeast  Very nice product,HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","When I first bought this, over a year ago, I was hesitant about the price - it being so low compared to other brands. Rest assured, this is all you will need! My finicky baby had to have his warm Alimentum. This bottle warmer is sooo quick and easy, I could put the water up to the predetermined line of the measurer(that comes with) poor it in and left it alone. It was ready within a minute and after a few shakes, it was the perfect temperature. This is also helpful for warming up baby food jars (Comes with a special attachment just for that purpose) The warmer was dropped twice on the floor so it can defently take a beating! Outside is easy to clean (the water deposits on the warmer - not so much) All in all It did the job for my little boy. And for $16 GET IT! And Get one for the Grandparents! Don't spend $30 on a bigger and bulker item that will do the same thing!",5
GEENNY Musical Mobile For All Star Sports CRIB BEDDING SET,It was a joy to see my son entertained by this mobile. All little boys love sports and this was just perfect for him.,5
Boxy Backpack Diaper Bag - Rhone Blooms,"I purchased this bag when I had my 3rd, after using boy diaper bags I wanted something more feminine. Def had to be a backpack as I had a 4 year old, 2 year old and newborn. I bought the stroller clips to use on our bugaboo and they work fine, just wish it was standard on the bag like some of the other brands of diaper bags. I LOVED having the zip out diaper changing station-absolutely a lifesaver for anywhere diaper changes. Liked the side pockets for water bottles and sippy cups/bottles, but sometimes they would fall out if I bent over (maybe needs a drawstring closure??). I used the bag both ways (backpack and messenger style) and I prefer the backpack.  It just seemed to wide to use as a messenger back IMO. Also wish there was a top handle and padded shoulder straps. On the plus side the material is completely wipeable and durable...the embroidery stitching is NOT. mine has snagged :(  The color on this particular print is not overly pink but definitely feminine with the soft pink flowers and interior. There is the removeable zip pocket in the inside for mommy stuff and two interior pockets....lacking IMO, the bag needs more. And the bag never has felt like it can carry everything I want to take, I'm usually left deciding on what to pack and leaving some stuff behind because it won't fit.  I'm going to try the Mrs. Smith's bag and we'll see if I end up selling my PPB!",4
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink",This is a big hit at our house.  This was a gift for my 18 month old on Christmas morning.  She was so excited to see her own sized chair and has sat in it every day for almost a year.  It's still a good size for her!,5
MAM Silicone Ulti 2pk Pacifier in Box Assortment,"I ordered these to have some variety in the pacifiers that my daughter has. The pacifiers that arrived are adorable, but there is a problem. The packaging says MAM by Sassy, but it does not say BPA free. I called MAM Baby as well as Sassy and neither company could verify whether or not the pacifiers are BPA free. Sadly, back they go.",1
Mommy's Helper Cushie Traveler,"My 3 year old is just finishing being potty trained.  I tried the flat foldable toilet seat for travel and she hated the &#34;pinch&#34; and wanted padding.  This seat is very portable, fits nicely in my diaper bag, and she has no problem using it out.  It folds to about 7inches long by 4 inches thick.",5
"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster Car Seat, Midnight Desert Micofiber","My almost 4 year old really likes this seat, as do I.  It is very heavy, much more substantial than some of the other brands I have looked at.  The only complaint I have is the fabric it is covered in is hot and I am a little concerned about how it will clean. Overall, a great seat.",4
"Philips Avent 10 Pack BPA Free Breast Milk Storage Starter Set, Clear, 6 Ounce","I intended to use these for breast milk storage, but since BF didn't work out for me, they were stuck in the closet unopened. Now that my baby is weaning, I decided to give these a try for homemade food storage. They're excellent! They hold enough food, seals well in the freezer, pops out without any effort and I know exactly how much I'm feeding her. I seriously love them! I can make big patches of food, immediately freeze them. To defrost, I run them in water for a few seconds, open the lid and the contents slip right out to a bowl to heat up. Easy peasy, no spills and no messing with cling wrap! Best part is they're BPA free.",5
"Jeep Stroller Parasol, Black","Brakes easily, however a good size to use with a small stroller or carseat .  Black but looks cute for a girl",1
MDR Store Faux Leather Skull Clutch PU Purse Rings Duster Knuckle Style Party Bag,"this bag is sick, sick, sick!  mad compliments!  quality of skulls is impressive & bag looks like real leather.  so hot!  cute!  sick!!!!",5
"Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Navy/Red","These are very handy to have around, secures toys or handled cups to the stroller. One did start to fray at the end after only a few weeks of use.",5
Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate,"My wife purchased this gate for then entry way between our living room and dining room.  I found it fairly easy to operate, but the clasps that hold the gate apart inside the fabric failed sending my twin daughter and son head first into the dining room.  The simple truth is that this item should be recalled.  It is substandard construction and will result in injury to you or your child.  If I could figure out how to do it, I would contact the company and ship the piece of junk back to them at my expense.",1
Yummi Pouch (Set of 6),"Im a mom of 3.  a daughter, 3yo and twin boys 18mo.  life is crazy!  to say the least.  and I hate messes, which is inevitable.  The reusable pouches have become an everyday item, a must for us!  breakfast, or snacks.... I mash up a smoothie and they chug it down, with no mess. I had been using the little green pouch and the infantino diposable and silicone ones,but after around a few months the little green ones didn't clean up well.  The fact that they were a very stiff material, made it difficult to get in the spout area or to the bottom creases, where food gets trapped.  The infantino ones were nice but you threw them out, and their silicone reusable ones, were hard for the little ones to suck or squeeze them to get everything out.  I just received the Yummi brand ones in the mail, and I love the feel.  they are similar to the disposable ones so easier to clean, and easier to get out.  So far, I have no complaints but Ive only had them for a few days, so that's why I only gave 4 outa 5 stars.  Oh and I ordered on their website and received them within 4 days!  love that.",4
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"This monitor is great for our house and we live near large power lines.  No static at our house but when we went to visit relatives in NV, lots of static.... so, I recommend that you try it out first.  Have had it on 24hrs a day for 2 months and no problems at our house!",5
Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer,I had purchased this Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer to be delivered to my parents house to use while home for the holidays.  I feel condensation is leaking on the outside.  Overall works well and I love the fact since I have a high watt microwave I only need to microwave it for 2 minutes.Given the option between the Advent and the Munchkin I feel the Advent is better quality sterilizer but it is still an overall good option for the price.,4
"Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet, Grey","The Pack n Play sheet is neither quilted, nor Tarragon. It is grey. The description and price do not match the item.",1
"Bunnies by the Bay Buddy Blanket, Skipit","Our daughter loves her """"la la"""" she won't sleep without it.  We now own three of these and have them in a rotation for getting washed.  The bunny looks a little worn but it does get washed every few days. The pink blanket portion has stayed soft on both sides.  We have bought several bunnies as gifts as well.  Highly recommed.",5
"Summer Infant Plush Pals Changing Pad Cover, Green/Brown (Monkey)","it is beutifull and soft, color it is ok, the qulity it is so high, i love it, i love it, and it is perfect size for the chngid pad",5
Jolly Jumper Bath Tub Toy Bag,"I purchased this item thinking it could hold a few small tub toys. It does that if it you like them on the floor.  The suctions haven't worked properly since day one. My shower tile walls are clean. It """"sucks"""" when you get scared half to death wondering what that loud crash was in your tub when it falls after you are already out of there.",1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","I bought this diaper because our OverNite Disposable Diapers were still leaking and baby boy was waking up cold and wet :o(. We tried doubling up the disposables and that didn't work. Finally a Friend tipped me off to buying a diaper like this to cover over the disposable and it works! Early this AM baby boy took a big poo in his disposable which leaked over onto the Fuzzy Bunz and I was extremely impressed how well and easily the Poo washed off the extremely super soft, fuzzy FuzzyBunz. Wow! Also, even with the double up baby boy  seems comfortable in this diaper. The adjustments are very good.",5
"AM PM Kids! Reversible Placemat/Chalkboard, Hoot Owls","Got it for my granddaughter, she's two years, and still impatient for her meals.  This keeps her occupied while waiting. Only bad thing is, not all chalk will work on it, I guess just the chalk that comes with it, not good when you lose the chalk, or throw out pieces when they break. Have to find out what kind of chalk it is, and where to get it.",4
"Pressions Handprint and Footprint Kit, Honey","We did impressions of our 5 month old and after many many many (~30) tries, the results came out great!  You just need to exercise patience and know that it will ALL be worth it in the end when you have this wonderful keepsake.  We watched the online video available on the Pressions website first and took their suggestion to do one foot imprint at a time.  I loved that these are 3D and are raised so you can see all the details, unlike the other kits out there that are recessed IN. Also, I really don't like the thought of the ink kits, even the invisible ones.  Just because you don't see the ink on her hands and feet doesn't mean it's all gone!  This kit is a bit expensive, but when my little girl is all grown up, I will not miss the $45 I spent and will just be happy to have a memory of the time she and her feet were so tiny.  I just wish I had gotten this kit when she was younger!I agree with some of the other reviewers that this is a 2-person job and that if your baby is still young, doing her footprints intead of handprints will be easier.The prints are made by pressing your baby's foot into slightly wet sand.  If the print doesn't come out right, just smooth out and try again. Once you are happy with the result, you pour some quick drying Plaster of Paris into the mold and let sit for a few hours. Once dry, you turn the whole thing upside down and all the sand will fall out except the grains stuck onto the plaster.  I took a small art paintbrush and lightly swept more of the sand away to better show some of the details and plan to buy some sort of clear protective coating to apply on top.Just remember to BE PATIENT (and make sure that your husband is, too) and don't settle for a print you're not happy with.  That is the beauty of this kit; you can try and try again!  It will all be worth it!",5
"Cosco Juvenile Funsport Play Yard, Kontiki","A little tricky (not difficult) to dismantle, but otherwise a great, affordable option for occasional use. I found instructions on how to take it down on YouTube.",4
Playtex 2 Pack VentAire Silicone Slow Flow Nipple,"We have slow flow nipples but these are just bad, might try to make the hole a little bigger to help it along.  Drips without any sucking occurring.Believe the issue is the baby isn't sucking properly on them to get anything out?  Child can handle 3 other types of nipples fine...",2
"Joovy Room&sup2; Portable Playard, Red","I have absolutely no idea why I never thought to send this back, or to call customer service about the horrible, horrible smell of this play yard, but I didn't. The smell has never gone away, and we have had this play yard for over a year. So to any of you who have one and think that the smell will probably just dissipate, IT WILL NOT. I'm very concerned about it now that I've discovered some of these arrive with no smell. I think I just thought that all play yards must smell, and generally assumed it would go away eventually, but it never has. The major question is: WHAT unnatural thing was used in the manufacture of *a place for babies to sleep* that would STILL smell this horrid after over a year of ownership? I will be calling them tomorrow and will update this review with their response.In terms of general quality, it's incredibly well made and very solid.  Maybe because it's so solid, it's very heavy.  You could see that as a positive or negative depending on whether you leave it set up in a room or pack it up and transport it often.  The sheet that comes with it is really soft, but white--not the best color for a playpen floor, really, but that's a minor complaint.  The smell has me worried, and that's not a good thing.  We parents have enough to worry about without adding this sort of thing to the mix!",2
"Jeep Wrangler Twin Sport All-Weather Stroller, Heat","I thought I had read enough reviews but apparently not.  Nice enough barebones stroller but doesn't fit through the doorways in my house leaving me to collapse it for storage which is sometime a pain.  My only other complaint is that there is only a lap belt and my 11 month old can bend forward practically out of the stroller.  So overall it's okay, not totally what I expected.",3
Meeno Baby Cool Me Seat Liner Stroller - Baby Blue,"works amazing on our City Select stroller, especially in the AZ heat!",5
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White","Bought this to keep the dog out of the baby's room.  Fits in a 30&#34; door frame and works well.  The top closure piece (that you can operate with 1 hand) was a little scuffed, but it doesn't interfere at all with its operation.  I (small female) can easily open this gate with one hand while holding the baby.  You will need to push the button on the top, as well as pull up the handle on the underside of the operator.  It's very easy.  I can do it with 2 fingers and a thumb.This gate also has a stopper on the bottom that allows you to either have it open only one direction, or swing freely in both directions.  It does not automatically close on its own.  And I do have to push it to close it (to make it latch by itself) or manually latch it behind me.I will definitely buy this again and am thinking about it to put in the bathroom to keep the dog out (although the opening is 55&#34; and I don't think that this one goes that far.)",5
Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat - Gray,This mat is perfect to protect your vehicle seats!  We have a suburban-so they are larger seats and it covers the whole seat and has a good size pocket in the front to store items.  I would recommend this item to save your vehicle seats!!,5
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary",We have two of these - they're great. I don't care about the little arm and hammer thing.. but it's nice that there's no weird padding or whatever to get pee in it. Just sleek and wipeable.,5
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx",Be aware that the item is really a different color than what it looks like online. It looks blue online but is really different shades of purple with pink edging.,3
"North States Supergate Slide-Step and Lock Open Gate, Burnished Steel","Bought three gates from three different brands. By far it&#34;s the best, although cheaper than the other one I got",5
Plush Penguin Hat With Long Paws,"Bought this for my 10 yr. old granddaughter who adores penguins.  It is so cute, sturdy, and well-made. I can wear it myself, including the mittens!  She is nearly as tall as me, and a little crazy lol and I know it will be one of her favorite Christmas gifts. It's warm, too, which really makes it outerwear, as well something to play with.",5
Eddie Bauer Sport Pack Diaper Bag,"I thought that this Eddie Bauer diaper back pack would be the answer to my problems.  I need to have ""free - hands"" to take care of baby Melody, but just weeks after I purchased this item, the lining started to come out (just like the other reviews).  I am totally disgusted with it.  At first I loved it because it has front compartments for my things and a back compartment for all of Melody's things, but now with the lining falling out it is not as good as it originally seemed.",1
"Munchkin SpongeBob SquarePants Click Lock Insulated Straw Cup, Colors May Vary, 9 Ounce","My nephew was extremely tickled and carries it  around everywhere.He is a spongebob over the top, totally focused funatic.",5
"Disney 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set, Taking The Race",Omg when I received this eventhough I was pissed off at fed ex that carrier sucks.. anyways good quality my son loved it was jumping up and down.. such a beauty... Also got it at a 50%off.... I'm in love with amazon good job....!!!,5
Fresh Baby So Easy Silicone Food Tray,"Prior to getting this food tray, I'd been using regular ice-cube trays.  Effective, cheap, and a pain in the tail to get the cubes out.  I would need to let the tray warm up a little bit, then twist and bash for a good 5 minutes to get all of the cubes out.  The flexible silicone allows me to pop out the cubes quickly and easily.  The 8 -1oz squares allows me to easily freeze one cup of food at a time.  The silicone cleans very easily, which I love.  My one minor negative is that, since the silicone is soft and flexible, it can be bit difficult to tap the whole tray againt the counter to get thicker purees to settle in the blocks, but that is easily outweighed by the positives.",5
"Stork Craft Beatrice 4 Drawer Chest, White",We got this dresser to match the crib we bought elsewhere.  The dresser matches the espresso color of the crib.  The only thing was that one of the cam lock pieces was damaged and there were not any extra in the container so there is one place on the dresser that is not locked together correctly.  Other than that i am happy with it.,4
"Bella Tunno Happy Knees Protective Pads, Tutti Fruitti Blue",Not a bad product. Just too tight on my sons legs,3
Earlyears Lil Shopper Play Set,"Nice little set, 9month old that received it enjoys it, only real complaint is the lack of bread, I mean really when you go shopping you get milk, produce, but come on, you have to get bread! I can even imagine how it could have a crinkly wrapper and everything, plus there is room in the bag for it. Seems as though it was omitted to save $, though otherwise it is fun. I thought I would like the cabbage the best, but the apple has a great chime inside, not sure who enjoys it more, me or the baby.",4
Crib / Toddler Baby Pillow - Made In USA,"I got this to go in the crib I just purchased but the pillow is too big for standard-sized baby pillow-cases (about 1/3 or 33% too big).. :( Otherwise, it's soft and very puffy.",2
"Carters Velour Playard Fitted Sheet, Ecru","This sheet is really soft and fits our Graco Pack n Play very nicely.  It also seems to hold up well in the wash.  My only complaint is that it seems to be visibly warn in the spot where our little girl usually slept while in the pack n play.  She didn't sleep in the pack n play for vey long so I was surprised by this wear.  I would definitely buy again, though, since it was so soft.",4
"Silly Billyz Towel Bandana Bib, Fuschia, 0-2 yrs","Love this bandana for my little drool monster. It's soft, easy to put on and looks very cute. Great item to have in your diaper bag!",4
Evenflo Soft And Wide Gate Taupe &amp; Chocolate,I don't normally write product reviews; but news about this gate is worthy to be shared! My 10-month-old daughter was constantly crawling around my feet while I was cooking in the kitchen. This gate fit perfectly in the wide space between my kitchen and dining room and has given me so much peace of mind.Other perks: It's attractive and easy to climb over. Oh! And no hardware to install. Just perfect.,5
Munchkin Bath Dunkers Toy Set,Did not stick to tub well at all,2
"Thirsties Diaper Cover, Celery, X-Small (6-12 lbs)","If you're doing your part to save the environment as well as some cash by using cloth diapers, this is the diaper cover to own! I used the small diaper cover from the time my son was a newborn (7lb 9oz) until he was 7 months old (18.5 lbs). When he was a newborn,the leg openings were a little big, however we overlapped and angled the side velcro straps when fastening to minimize the gaps and never had a problem with leakage. We used small sized pre-folds as well as old fashioned fold-them-yourself diapers which fit perfectly in the small sized Thirsties.We went up to the medium sized Thirsties when we upgraded to the large sized cloth diapers. He could still fit the small Thirsties if we used medium sized diapers. I fully expect the medium sized Thirsties covers to last him till he's potty trained since there is a wide range of adjustments.These Thirsties are easy to clean and dry quickly on the line. They seem to be comfortable and breathable since we've never had a problem with diaper rash and my son has very sensitive skin. They also last a long time! I received my first Thirstie from a friend who used them for her two sons. The velcro isn't as strong as my new covers but strong enough to hold the cover on. We've never had a problem with leakage on that one either and this is the third baby bottom it's covering!",5
"American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Chenille Fitted Contoured Changing Pad Cover,Ecru",I bought this as an extra cover for my changing pad.  It matches my green nursery perfectly for a boy or girl and it so soft!  I'm sure my new baby will love it!,5
Britax Back Seat Mirror,This is the PERFECT mirror if your baby is in the rear middle seat and the seat doesnt have a headrest!  It easily straps to my rear driver side headrest and swivels so I can perfectly see my baby rear facing in the middle seat.  Wish I wouldve found this before I wasted money on a regular mirror and a mirro that was supposed to stick to my back windsheild (but didnt)!,5
Sassy Baby Sweet Dreams Crib Mirror,"Our baby doesn't seem much interested in this. Granted, I can't ask him why, but I can only assume that he can't possibly recognize the distorted face in the mirror as his own, or even that of a human. Frankly, the ""funhouse"" effect of this mirror would freak me out a bit if I woke up with this in my face.",2
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,I used my wedges to prop up a broken shelf in our RV.  Very useful little widget.,5
Leachco Easy Teether XL - Crib Rail Cover For Convertible Cribs - Chocolate,We needed something to protect our brand new expensive sleigh style crib.  This works great!  The baby loves the toys that hang on it.,5
"BOB Duallie Snack Tray, Black","It is a snack tray and does what it is suppose to do.  I do like that it installs so easily on this new model, unlike the older model.  My kids like to have a place to put their toys, snacks and drinks while walking and this works great.  The cup holders could be a little deeper for taller cups, but we have never had any problems.  Overall good product, but it would be nice if some of the accessories came with the stroller as this is now the second one I have had to purchase since the first was the version with the car seat adapter on one side and snack tray on other side.",4
The First Years Star Teething Blanket,My son loves this blanket. He likes looking and talking at the starfish and enjoys chewing on the different fabrics.  He finds the squeaker portion amusing and also just squeezing the blanket and making it krinkle.,5
Eddie Bauer Adjustable 3-in-1 Booster Seat,"This car seat seems like a good design until you try to put it in a vehicle. It's nearly impossible to reach behind the armrests and base to buckle in, whether you are using the belt or the latch straps. Also, my boys' heads fall forward when they fall asleep, restricting their airways. I hate these seats, I returned them both today after giving them a couple of months, and I am buying something that might be a little more expensive than the $55 each I paid in favor of something that is easy to put in and out, and comfortable for the kids.",1
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Newborn Napper, Melbourne","I LOVE the bassinet and changing table, but now my baby has transitioned to the crib portion. The mattress support is made of little more than 4 pieces of fiberboard. After sleeping in it for a month or two the mattress sags and buckles. I've attempted many times to line the boards up straight in a row, but as soon as baby lays down they get out of alignment again.",3
"South Shore Savannah Collection Door Chest, Pure White","Kind of flimsy. Quality is not that great. But, considering how much an item like this in real wood would cost, it's not too bad. You basically get what you paid for.",3
Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 4 Wide Neck Nipple,"I changed it just now, and it takes just 2 min for him to drink milk, so fast, love it!!!",5
Ginny Fraser 11 Piece Jungle Nursery In A Box,This is the most wonderful bedding! I bought this set for my daughter and a year later it still looks as good as the day I pulled it out of the bag. It has been through 3 moves and suffered all sorts of abuse and is still like brand new. I think its defentially a great deal and worth it! I couldn't have picked a better set. The colors are so bright and bold. The animals are so cute and fun! I loved all the extras and the mobile plays a sweet song. Defentially the set to buy if your doing jungle theme!,5
Munchkin Portable Diaper Caddy (Colors May Vary),The product seemed big from the image on the Product Display page. But when the caddy arrived it seemed pretty small with little space. We were totally unsatisfied with the product.,3
"Kid Shield, 15' Roll for Banister Safety",It arrived fine shipped not damaged just have not needed to use it yet. This just reminded me to get it out today and use it for my stairs or my railing.,5
"Britax Parkway SGL Booster Seat, Cardinal",Great fit for our four-year-old boy. He can fasten his belt by himself. Nice to have him be involved in the mad dash out the door.,5
SUPER ABSORBENT bandana dribble bib by Zippy Suit (baby toddler / Light Pink),Very baby soft & absorbent. Pink is a very pale pink. I like that it has two adjustable snaps to go around baby's neck.,5
Wubbanub Pacifier Pouch,"When I had my babies this was not yet out.  I purchased this along with some of the pacifiers and I was thrilled with the size, feel, and clip.  I think that this is a great addition to the product and it is a good idea.",5
The First Years miPump Double Electric Breast Pump,"This device was defective, it was easy to assemble and it didn't work. I bought this for my daughter and tragically it didn't work. She is a first time mother and needs to pump. Sad to know it doesn't work",1
Totally Toddler Stain Remover -24 fl oz,"Our son has pooped in his car seat,  spit up all over our couch and stained every piece of clothing and this seems to do the trick every time. Very happy with the product.",5

Hygeia Mother's Milk 3ct Storage Containers 4oz,"The Hygeia was not my first choice for a breast pump, but the pump itself works great and I have no complaints with it; these bottles are a different story! The first time I placed them in my microwave sterilizer, they SHRANK! They melted, became misshapen, and the number measurements were off by a full ounce! The standard Medela and Lansinoh brand storage bottles both work well with the Hygeia adapter, and I have not had any issues with the plastic melting in either of these (after two months of usage/once weekly sanitation).",1
Levana Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery and Talk to Baby Intercom,"Finally, a noise free monitor! My husband can sleep now, for there is no interference noise.Cons: haven't figured out how to keep the video turned on when in battery madeThe screen sometimes darkens sporadically on the upper area",5
Juvenile Solutions Baby Cubes Baby Food Storage - Eight 2 Ounce Cubes,These storage containers work well for the early stages of food introduction. They stack nicely and don't take up too much space in freezer. Better than the small cube trays with covers I think.,1
"Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory","I have to say everything about this pillow is pretty much wonderful.  I gave it 4 stars because it's a little too hard for what I like by my head.  I've woken up twice now with a sore ear.I bought this because I am a back sleeper and during pregnancy they say it's not really good to sleep on your back.  I'm 26 weeks pregnant and even with a few pillows surrounding me while I sleep I was waking up on my back.  I finally broke down and bought this $70 pillow.  It keeps me on my side and even allows me to sleep slightly on my back without really being on my back.  Exactly what I needed.  Again, it's a little hard by my ear, but maybe it soften up a bit after more use.",4
"Stork Craft Beatrice 4 Drawer Chest, White","Product came with instructions for a 3 drawer unit, had extra parts, holes for KD fittings were too large so fittings fell out during assembly making assembly difficult at times...for the price was not near the quality a product that one would expect. Once completely assembled was fairly sturdy but don't expect it might be a long term investment.",3
Maxboost Designer Slim iPhone 5S/5 Case - Rainbow,I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation and the case is really pretty with good quality. Just have a try and you will never regret.,5
"Quickzip Crib Zipper Sheet, Blue Mink","LOVE these sheets.  Bought them for the wintertime as I figured they'd be warmer for my little love, but I still use them now in late spring/early summer as they're so soft and she strokes them with her sweet little hand as she falls asleep.  I also think they helped when she was still sleeping on her back with reducing the hair loss on the back of her head from turning her head back and forth!",5
"Baby Trend Sit N Stand Double Stroller, Elixer",Highly recommend this stroller for any parent having two little ones close in age. Right now I have a 3 year old and 1 year old and I am expecting another little one in a few months. I love it and my kids love it too. It's not that heavy for a double stroller I can easily lift it and I am 33 weeks pregnant. It's also very easy to convert the stroller to your liking and I love the fact it grows with the child.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Mom and Granny love this cot.  Our toddler is a little squirm bug in his sleep.  He's not quite ready to sleep in a big bed, or at least we're not ready to have a fall out of a big bed!This cot is perfect!  It's lightweight and it's low to the ground.  If there's a fall out of the bed, it's only 8 inches or so.  That's a lot less a fall than from a regular bed.  It's good practice for when we transition to a full sized bed.",5
Clay Handprint &amp; Footprint Keepsake Photo Desktop Frame - Black,"My son's hand and foot prints came out great!  The negative is the picture frame to add your picture is not 5 x 7, it is not 4 x 6 either is some odd size. We had to cut down the picture to make it work.  Buyer beware.",2
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Hi - In concept this is a great idea, but I want to make sure people know about certain limitations.  Because of the placement of the securing straps, this sheet CANNOT be used on convertible cribs with a solid headboard.  You must have slats on all 4 sides of the crib - or be handy with a needle and thread.Just want to make sure people know, as these sheets are expensive and I was very disappointed to learn that I am unable to use them.",3
Jumbo Toy Hammock Net Organize Stuffed Animals,Not so easy to install,2
"Boppy Changing Pad Cover and Liner, Heirloom Flower",Vibrant and does it's job! Kept my changing pad clean and i just needed to wash the mat! This held up well through washing.,5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"I live in a horrible place, where it snows from as early as October and continues until as late as March. I have stuff to do that requires walking outside, so we bundle up and carry on. This stroller is an immense help with that. Ive driven it through as much as 2 inches of snow with no problem; over thick ice on the road it does fine, through icy and snowy parking lots with uneven ground - no issues at all. The wheels still look great, and my child is comfortable. I use a toddler sized bundleme on this just fine, and also one of those jeep rain guards when needed. I am very pleased with this, especially for well under a hundred dollars.",5
"SoHo Nap Mat , Classic Pink &amp; white Leopard Print",because it's not from %100 cotton it makes a lot of static electricity. some kids are really sensitive to that,3
Westminster Hand Boilers (Colors May Vary),People love to ask me &#34;what is that there on your desk there&#34; and I watch them pick it up and pray that they don't drop it.  It is fragile.That's all I have to say about that.,5
Piyo Piyo Yellow Baby Nail Scissors,I opened these and threw away the package but I just realized that they are not baby nail scissors that I received. My pregnancy brain didn't kick in until after garbage day. Bummer. Looks like a lot of people have had the same issue with getting the wrong item as well. :-/,2
12x16 Toddler Pillow (Playful Monkey),I bought a regular size pillow- too big. Pillow Pets- too hot. This one is perfect size and filled just right for my 28 m.o. daughter. She loves it and so do I. It's cute too.,5
"OXO Tot Whale Pail, Blue","I love the white OXO whale pail, looks sleek compared to the blue one. The suction cups worked well for me, unlike other reviewers who could not get them to stick. Its really 2 peices, one side stays on the bath wall, while the other with the handle can be lifted off. Neat idea, but I think it will fall off easily. I don't know about other kids, but mine have aquired quite a few bath toys and hardly any will fit in this pail. I had to pick a few toys to put in it and store the rest  in a bath cabinet. So, the 4 star review is for the lack of space inside this whale pail. If your looking for something to hold alot of toys, this is NOT it. But, if you want something for a few toys, sleek, not tacky..then this is for you.",4
Kolcraft - Pediatric 800 Crib and Toddler Mattress,"I bought this mattress for my son when he moved into a toddler bed. I love the Kolcraft and can see it lasting a good while as well. Its nice and firm but still soft enough to be comfortable. I will say one word of caution though, not so much about the mattress itself but about the price. While I am writing this review, Amazon is selling it for $120. That is why it got a 3 star review. Otherwise it would get 5 stars! Walmart carries this mattress for $40! Save yourself a good amount of money and go elsewhere to purchase![...]",3
"Safety 1st Complete Air Protect 65 Convertible Car Seat, Great Lakes","Currently, the product features and product description contradict each other in regards to the weight limit of this car seat.  The seat holds a child up to 65lbs (thus the name, ""Air 65"").  The Air Protect only holds a child up to 50lbs.Anyway, onto my review.We are using this as a rear facing seat in our Chevy Malibu, and it fits just fine. Yes, it is a big car seat, but safety was my number one priority when upgrading to a toddler car seat, so I don't mind the bulk. I love that we can keep the seat rear facing up to 40 lbs, now that the AAP's new recommendation is to wait till age 2, this seat makes it easy to do so.I'm glad we had the Chicco Keyfit 30 when our guy was an infant. I'm sure this is safe enough, but I wouldn't want it as an infant seat . . . too inconvenient. Even though my son isn't quiet 1 yet, he was ready for a more toddler friendly seat. This delivers, he isn't leaning back as far and the sides don't cave in next to him. I could tell he liked having things a little roomier the moment I put him in this seat. He still falls asleep with ease.The cup holder isn't pictured, but there is a detachable one in the box. The material is easy to take off and machine wash when accidents happen.My hubby and Father-in-law set this up in about 7 minutes. If you are going to use it rear facing, you do need a rolled up towel or pool noodle underneath (this is clear in the instruction booklet).Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",5
"Kissaluvs Cotton Fleece Booster Doublers, 6 Pack, Unbleached",I love these boosters for when I just need a little extra in my son's cloth diaper.  It adds a lot absorbency without a lot of added bulk.  I would definitely get these again.,5
2-in-1 Professional Clinical RY210 Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead and Surface,"Take a good look at all of the ""positive"" reviews...they were all written by the same person. Notice the same general tone and lenght of each review. Notice they all are written by someone using a first name only. And the dead giveaway, notice the lack of a space between one or more of the sentences. Really? This may be a good product, but I won't buy it on general principle based on these fake reviews.UPDATE: I received this product to try and review it. While I wasn't thrilled with the fake reviews that were posted, I was interested in the product. As the father of four, young children a thermometer in our home is always well used. This product seemed great because the in-the-ear types and the swipe the forehead types require you to move and make contact with your child. That can be hard when they are cranky, sleeping or have (yet another) ear infection. The non-contact Infrared Thermometer worked well. The temperature readings can vary slightly, but when you follow the instructions it is accurate. For the price, this is a good product that works well. I'm sure that soon this is the technology that will be used for almost all thermometers and they will get even better.",4
"Vital Baby Baby's 1st Feeding Set, Pink",I purchased these spoons for my 4 1/2 old month.  They are fantastic.  I would definitely buy them again.,5
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black",I did not wanted to stick the plastic cup to my window..this is the best one according to me. Fits in window perfectly. Does the work.Has cling wrap like design on the back but much sturdier..leaves no mark when removed and you can put it back any number of times..It is the good reason why it is Ranked#1 i guess.,5
"Evenflo Chase LX Harnessed Booster Car Seat, Reese","Good car seat, the upholders fall out too easily but otherwise great.",4
Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker,My mom bought this for me over the holidays.  I was so excited to use it as I wanted to try making my own organic baby food at home.  Being a busy professional I never imagined it would be this easy.  I love the all in one concept.  The only thing I wasn't happy about was that it cost $150 but was made in China.  I would have preferred for it to be made in France as I'm sure it used to be a few years ago.  Another thing:  I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to secure the blade when I first opened it.  The instruction book wasn't very descriptive about it except for a small picture.  A phone call to the company finally resolved the issue.,5
"DaVinci Piedmont 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Espresso","I haven't used it for our baby yet since he hasn't arrived yet but my husband doesn't most of the afternoon assembling it. It was packed well but still arrived with some scratches here and there.It was a very time consuming project though the instructions were pretty good. As far as looks, it's beautiful ..no issue there..and it seems solid. We fit a Colgate Natural 1 well with a good amount of compression at the sides for safety sake.I'll update after we have used it a few months.",4
Leachco Prop 'R Shopper - Shopping Cart Cover - Sage Pin Dot,My 5 month old baby loves it! He is so cute & comfortable in it. I would highly recommend it.,5
"Nurtria Non-Slip Divided Warming Baby Plate, Blue","I filled this with hot tap water, water warmed in the micro and nothing kept my granddaughters food warm any longer than if I put it on a regular plate.  The removable rubber ring will be a good idea when she's old enough to feed herself.  I ended up removing the ring and putting the food in the plate and then micro for 25 sec.  This way I could keep warming it when it cooled.  Even preheating the baby food before putting it in the plate with the hot water didn't keep it any warmer than just warming the food in the plate to start with.  Any divided dish would work the same.",1
"Thermos Funtainer Food Jar, Littlest Pet Shop",Love this! my daughter is such a picky eater and this saves me a lot of frustration at lunch time! mac and cheese and spag o's still warm at lunch!  thanks!  shipping was quick!,5
Evenflo Bounce and Learn Bee Exersaucer,My son loves this! I wish it lit up or made noise that's why I gave it 4 stars. He does like it though- and it's very easy to put together. I'd recommend it to a friend.,4
Fisher-Price Disney Baby Simba's King-Sized Play Gym,"I bought this play gym for my 3 month old nephew and I absolutely LOVE it. It was one of the nicest play gyms that I have seen on Amazon. Also, it is good quality mat and very easy to assemble. My sister had bought another play gym from Amazon that was about $20.00 and it fell apart almost immediately. So, if I were you I would spend the extra money and buy this wonderful play gym. I would highly recommend this for your little one!",5
"Dr. Brown's Designed To Nourish 2 Pack Divided Plate, Colors May Vary","Really can't go wrong.  They are divided and work like they are supposed to.  I mean, what can you say about a plate?",5
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue",My 3 month old loves this jumper. The only problem is that his feet do not reach the floor but he is still able to bounce around in it. That's why I'm giving it four stars. He loves all the toys that come with it and that you can connect other toys to it. I have tried him in other jumpers and he did not care for them at all. I am glad that he is still able to bounce around in it without his feet reaching the floor.,4
"American Baby Company 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Natural",These are very nice sheets that fit the Graco Pack-n-Play.  They are very soft and much nicer feeling than the standard sheets.  I bought 2 so that I could always have one washing and one on my baby's bed.,5
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","We had the UppaBaby Vista (2012 model) for 14 months before it was stolen, and we purchased this stroller to replace it.  The strollers are extremely similar in their design and functionality.  And, at the time, the Britax B-Ready with bassinet was hundreds less than getting another UppaBaby Vista.Pros:The shocks are noticeably better.  I felt like our baby could feel every bump on the sidewalk with the Vista, and the B-Ready is much smoother.  The mechanism to fold up the stroller is so much easier.  I always struggled with folding up the Vista the whole 14 months we had it.  It actually comes with a cup holder.  It's prone to falling out if it gets knocked or while your folding it up like most plastic cup holder attachments.  (Sidenote:  The Britax Stroller Organizer is a great cup holder that doesn't fall off.)Cons:The Britax is a little heavier and wider than the Vista, which could be good or bad depending on where you live.  We live in the city, and I'm frequently folding up the stroller to carry up and down stairs.  It's also too wide to take on the bus, but, to be honest, the Vista wasn't easy to take on the bus either.Overall, I really prefer the Britax B-Ready and this it's a great stroller!  But, if you are comparing these two, they are so similar that the price you can get on them is probably the main factor!General stroller buying tip:You can get a big discount on the previous years' stroller model depending on when you purchase.  The manufacturers give big discounts to unload the old model before releasing the new model.  And, really, do stroller features change that much from year-to-year?  No.  We had the Vista in our wish list on Amazon while I was pregnant and waited on it, not realizing it was the older model.  Then when we went to purchase, we had to get the new model for $150 more because we waited.  Our friend got the older model, and they were hardly different.  Wish we had saved the money instead, so learn from our mistake and see if you can get a deal on an old model!  You can also save by getting a color other than the standard black or grey.",5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,"As far as the safety straps, it took me 2 seconds to realize that the straps are attached underneath and therfore there is NO need for the slits, I have the pink one on my changing table and the straps are fine and secure. I love this product, it dresses up baby's room and I intend on getting more.",5
"Pickles Nummy Animal Snuggly Banky, Ivory Lamb, 16 X 16&quot;","This is an adorable baby shower gift. It tops off a gift basket so nicely and it's such a cute idea. The blanket size is a little small, but it's perfect for traveling with and laying over your baby in a car seat. Great gift!",5
California Baby Eco Traveler Mixed Scent Gift Set,So I got this because it was my first introduction to California Baby.  I am SO HAPPY I DID!  I realized I did not like the Calendula line because the smell was too strong for me.  The Over tired and cranky line was a little too medicinal smelling to me too.  I liked the calming line and I love the Tee Tree and Lavender bodywash!  I ended up buying a bigger size of the for the whole family.  I also realized I like the Sensitive/unscented line for my new baby.  I loved that I got to try both sunscreens and the therapeutic diaper cream.  Great travel sizes too...not super small.  Great introduction to the line to find out what you like!!,5
"The Happy Closet Baby Closet Dividers, Blue and Green",I am a big organizer so I love having these in the nursery. Shipping was fast and easy: I received my product earlier than the latest estimated delivery date. I had no problems with the order and the product is exactly as pictured and described. The only thing I wish is that there were more clear labels in the package.,5
Fisher-Price My Little Snugabunny Newborn Rock n' Play Sleeper,"Liner gets moldy with use.  Can't resell.  Also, that means that your child breaths in mold spores if you use this.  And we cleaned ours frequently.",2
Pigeon Nail Scissor (New Born Baby) Made in Japan,"I know it's expensive, but this nail scissor makes up for its cost with peace of mind. I tried a ""baby"" nail clipper (actually a regular nail clipper encased in plastic) and ended up catching my daughter's skin. I despaired that I couldn't keep her nails short to protect her face. Then I finally purchased this scissor and discovered how easy it could be to do a safe, precision job. The blades are sharp but rounded and it's easy to avoid the skin and control the length of the nails. Highly, highly recommended!",5
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,"There is no comparison: These are the best blankets out there.Definitely buy THESE specific blankets (boutique, size 47x47) - they are much better quality and are bigger than the ones you buy in box stores.We have 6 of these, use them EVERY day, and I wish I had more!",5
"Kiddy Cruiserfix Pro Car Seat, Walnut",My 4 year old needed a booster seat and my wife's family in Germany told us about this great car seat. The seat comes with side impact protection and adjusts for his growth with the back rest and seat for his legs. We know that it is of the highest quality and that this will be the last car seat he will need.,5
Mommy's Helper Panda Door Pinch Guard,These door stops work very well.  They stop the door with enough space so that little baby fingers don't get caught.,5
"Blue Baby Boy-Instant Pop Up Mosquito Net Crib, Baby Tent, Beach Play Tent, Bed Playpen,","It was perfect for an infant, but flimsy. Not a substitute for a pack n play or tent... Okay for a newborn in the shade or inside... Not appropriate for movers, or in the sun.",4
"OXO Tot Straw Cup, Aqua, 11 Ounce",ordered 2 sizes in this cup.  haven't used these yet but they are light and I am sure like the other products I have ordered made by OXO I will be very happy,4
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I bought this to take out the guess work and hassle of warming bottles, but it is not working for me. I try to set it so that I can turn it on, go change the baby then it would be ready. This method works occasionally but I get inconsistent results. Whenever the light turns off, the milk is still cold and I have to let it sit for another few minutes to finish warming. If I wait too long it's too hot, so I have to stand there and wait for it. Occasionally when I warm a bottle it somehow seems to boil the milk out if it. Don't know if the top of the bottle was loose or what but I'm finding it easier to just go back to sitting bottles in hot water from the tap. Very disappointed.",2
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","This item was a good buy.  After reading all the reviews, I made the decision to try it out.  I am a breastfeeding mommy, and this pillow comes in handy.  It eases the strain of holding the baby while breastfeeding every couple of hours, and even helps him latch on easier.  My husband can even use the pillow when bottle feeding.  I would recommend.  Not a necessity, but definitely a helper!",5
"Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep",This was such a cutie that I bought two for the nephew and niece I was expecting...they were a hit and I would recommend the little sheep to anyone who is in need of a baby gift.,5
Lamaze Soft Chime Garden Musical Toy,When it arrived it was obviously opened and resealed.  Didn't make any noise or music at all.  I returned this item.,1
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","I had been using a Dr. Brown's bottle brush for my Dr. Browns bottles until it fell apart (just normal wear on the sponge).  This brush does a much better job of soaping and cleaning the inside of my Dr. Brown's bottles and I can squeeze the brush into a ton of different things!  The bristles are softer than the Dr. Browns brush so I get more soap suds and I feel as if it's more gentle on my bottles (not that it really matters that much).  Other reviewers are right about the nipple cleaner, I'm never going to use it, and it doesn't make much sense.  I wish instead of the nipple cleaner, there was a small pipe thingy like the small pipe cleaners that come with the Dr. Brown's bottles (for the blue tube).  The base is also much more stable than Dr. Browns.I'm so glad I decided to order this brush instead of getting another Dr. Browns.  I'm convinced that the reviewers of the Dr. Browns bottle brush haven't tried this one.  I didn't hate my other brush, but this one is just much better.  Glad I tried it!",5
We Sell Mats 36 Sq Ft Alphabet and Number Floor Mat,This mat  is great for a baby that is just learning to crawl or is sitting up. Its soft enough to not heart your baby in case he/she falls and hard enough for baby to be able to crawl and roll over easily.I highly recommend this mat.,5
Sunshine Kids Easy View Back Seat Mirror,"I really should have read the reviews before buying this mirror.... I actually tried to cancel this item but it had already shipped. Our mirror hasn't broken (yet) but it's pretty useless. It vibrants while you're driving so you cannot really see your kid. The vibrations cause the mirror to move so it's always out of place. Either way, it serves us no purpose. I'll be getting rid of it and going back to the other kind.",1
"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","My 2.5 year old daughter received this from the ""binky fairy"" as a subsitute for one of her two binkies that she required each night. It is SO SOFT and she absolutely adores her ""Monkey""...I had to order a second one to make sure she always had a clean one available. It really helped to wean her off the binky -- once she was used to using her monkey & just one binky, then we were able to wean her off the other pacifier too.",5
rooCASE EVA Hard Shell (Black) Carrying Case with Memory Foam for Nikon Coolpix Digital Camera S3300 S4300 S6300 S9300 L26 P310,"I have a problem with my camera, I have noticed the flash comes out automatically, but when I turn off the camera it wont close unless I push it back. I need to know what is the step to be taken for replacement on this unit...other than this it is a great piece!",2
Maya Wrap Lightly Padded Baby Sling-Medium-Bright Stripe,"Bought this because it was recommended by experienced baby wearers. Very comfortable and baby really enjoys it (6 month old). I use it when I'm doing chores around the house, when I'm grocery shopping and when we go for walks. My stroller is now collecting dust. :) glad that product included instructional DVD because it helped me fold the wrap in a way which makes adjusting easy for putting baby in and taking baby out.",5
Summer Infant Little Looster,Got this for my 5 year old son who made us hold him while he was sitting on the potty. I originally bought this with plans to buy a form of handle for him to hang on to. This stool gave him a great place to steady/place his feet and we didn't need to purchase anything else. Great item!!,5
"Tommee Tippee Deco Starter Set, Girl","If you don't like advent bottles you probably won't like tommee tippee either. I was looking for a slow flow nipple and both advent and this bottle claim to be slow flow but are not! Far from slow, my baby wore half her bottle on her face. Giving it a three its not a terrible bottle if your looking for something with faster flow nipple.",3
Nuby Electric Flex Breast Pump,This is a very nice quality pump with the capability of electric or manual pumping.  This is going to be very useful.,5
Professional Clinical Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead (Fahrenheit Readings),"I am disappointed.  I have the flu and didn't want to drive to the store to pick up a thermometer so came to Amazon (like I do most of my shopping).  Chose this one.  I knew I would have to wait a few days before taking my temperature by ordering here but it was worth the effort of me trying to drag myself to the store.  It arrived today and I tried EVERYTHING to turn it on.  Even putting in new batteries, changing the batteries directions, pushing every button I could find since the booklet directions weren't clear on what button actually turns it on.  It stayed dead no matter what I did.  Packed it back up to get returned and will have a friend pick up a thermometer from a local store.",1
Boppy Prenatal Total Body Pillow,Wife was complaining daily how she can't get comfortable when she sleeps anymore.  She only slept in her back or stomach.  Now pregnant she can't. We took a shot at this pillow and she hasn't complained since.  I haven't asked. But the complaint have stopped.  And it's been 3 months.  Baby due in 3 more months. And she has used for 3 months now.  So Ill rate this product as good being I don't hear I can't sleep good anymore.  Lol.,5
"Trend Lab Fleece CribWrap Rail Covers for Crib Sides (Set of 2), Pink, Wide","Soft, easy to put on the crib. Washable which is necessary. Helps prevent my son from chewing on crib rails.",4
"Munchkin Snack Dispenser, Colors May Vary",Giving it 5 starts for the price. The only knock I have on the product it that the picture looks like you'd be able to rotate the cap to the different sections. But there is a plastic ridge that prevents full rotation. Removed easily enough with a straight razor.,5
Ingenuity Portable Swing - Bella Vista,"This swing is great! It was super easy to assemble.  It has just the right amount of swinging power behind it and as an added touch, the music it plays is very pleasant.  I can easily move it from room to room without breaking my back or a doorway.  And my little guy enjoys this swing while Mommy gets a much needed shower.",5
"Munchkin 2 Piece SpongeBob SquarePants Insulated Sippy Cup, Colors May Vary, 9 Ounce",I have used alot of sippy cups with my kids. I have always been looking for a cup that doesn't leak but is easy to drink from for the child also. I bought these and saw that they had a leak proof garuntee. My kids were so excited to try them becuase they love spongebob. But when my daughter first used the cup it leaked all the way down her shirt. I emailed the company and they sent me replacement cups free of charge. I must have just gotten a bad cup because the new ones don't leak at all. I will be buying more cups by munchkin with other characters on them. They are the best cup I have used yet.,5
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","I purchased the Ergo because my 17 lbs daughter was getting too heavy for the Moby (preferred by me) or the Bjorn (preferred by my husband).  I have a Snugli back carrier, but this made my neck and shoulders ache.  I looked on youtube for some moby backholds and even tried a few but they seemed cumbersome to tie and dangerous to slide the baby into.  I've been stalking the ergo for a while, reading all the horror stories of copycat ergos, watching craigslist and ebay and staring with adoration at the $115.00 Target ones.  Finally, one night the amazon ergo went on sale so I cashed in my visa points with the sale and took advantage of the free shipping and purchased the ergo cheaper than I had found on craigslist.  It shipped quickly and after a bullet point inspection proved I had the real deal, we put it on.  Like the title of this review says, mama and baby love this as a back carrier.  The weight sits on my lower back which makes it comfortable for me and baby sits in the carrier so she isn't giving herself a front wedgie.  I use this for the afternoon witching hour to make dinner and get chores done.  I've gotten brave enough to put this on in the grocery store parking lot and shopping at the mall.  Baby loves throwing her weight side to side and the extra room she has to move.  The adjusts easily and my husband wears her too.  Looking forward to giving this thing a lot of use!",5
Pinky Teddy Bear by Bearington Bear,I wanted a little bigest than the original... It was a present for my grant nice and she wanted to hug her bear and this is to small...,3
Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"This is the best investment anyone who has an infant could make.  My son is 11 months old, and has used this since he is about 7 months old, and he absolutely loves it!  He jumps his little heart out, and it keeps him very content and occupied for a good amount of time!  He laughs and screams and yells and sings the whole time!  I would recommend the Jumperoo to everyone!",5
Sesame Street Alphabet Foam Floor Puzzle,"Nice foam puzzle. We use it to make blocks with it instead since it's not a large peice for the floor. It was sort of misleading when I brought this thinking that it can be used as a playmat. It really is small that you can't really sit on it. Better use it as building block and if for a puzzle, not really worth it.",3
"Manual Woodworkers Cotton Baby Quilt, This Little House, 30 X 40&quot;","When I saw the pic for it on amazon, it looked really nice and would be perfect for a portable crib. After reading about the company on their website, I thought I was getting a quality US made product but upon receiving it, it was nothing more than yet another made in china product.  Super cheap looking and very thin, like a bedspread from motel 6. If I saw it in a store, I wouldn't even pay $10 for it.",2
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","These little pink bunnies are perfect for protecting little necks from car seat straps!  My daughter loves her pink bunnies!  Better yet, they are machine washable!  They are super soft and also prop up a sleepy baby head when they decide to take a nap on a long car ride. Definitely recommend these!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",Great back support and placement for baby. I ended up just side-lying mostly but would reccommend this if you can't or dont want to side-lie in the early days,4
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner Portable Placemat, Pink",The actual color is much darker than the pic. My daughter did not like it at all as she wants a PINK one.,1
Thudguard Baby Safety Helmet - Blue,"I would have rated the helmet with 5 stars, but my little guy perspires quite a bit and that makes it uncomfortable for him. Still, I'm glad I bought it and I'll keep using it (but for short periods of time).",4
"Bumkins Reusable Sandwich and Snack Bag, Bright Blue, Large","Who says I can't take a Dr.Seuss bag with me on the trails?  This bag is just big enough for a regular sandwich or a small portion of trail mix.  I like my whole wheat, Swiss cheese sandwiches and this bag is perfect for that.  It's also ideal for an office or school lunch bag.  It configures well to the carrier it is in.It can be turned inside out for quick wipe-downs and drying.  A zipper keeps the odor to a minimum.  The material is strong enough to last for many uses.  Another thing I like is that the material doesn't smell nor carry an odor over to the food.",5
"Graco Blossom 4-In-1 Seating System, Sapphire","Easy to use, and fairly easy to assemble.  Adjustable in many different ways...all useful.  &#34;4 in 1 seating system&#34; is accurate.",5
CoCaLo Harlow Boudoir Pillow,"This is a beautiful pillow with fabulous detail that goes great with my nursery decor. it was smaller than I though it was going to be is my only complaint, but that is my fault for not reading the dimensions before I ordered it. Love love love this set!",4
Graco Digital Deluxe Video iMonitor Baby Monitor,"After reading some of the POSITIVE reviews of this product, I bought this monitor. BIG MISTAKE! The picture quality is very blurry during the day and night and the screen is not in full color during the day like the box shows. It is a very poor image. Sometimes I can't tell if my baby is turning his head or if the image is just blurring at that moment.This unit claims to be able to have a 600FT range. I have a 3,600 sq ft house so I figured I could at least go down stairs and have the ability to see my baby. NOPE! The monitor is constantly searching for the image and it has a tiling effect when it does this. I even put the monitor in my room which is less than 50ft from my baby's room and it still has a tiling effect while the monitor is on. Things like microwaves, computers, cell phones and cordless phones interfere with the picture on my monitor. I sent back this unit to Graco thinking mine was defective and when I got the brand new one a few days ago, I had the same problems!!The positive reviews I saw on Amazon prior to my purchase of this product were probably written by someone who worked for Graco or owned some of their stock.I would buy another product besides this one if you are in the market for a video monitor.",1
"Inglesina Club Highchair, Graphite","I bought this high chair for my grandson to use at my house. He outgrew it after about 2 1/2 months of use. Would probably work OK for a smaller baby- my grandson is off-the-growth-chart tall for his age.ProsLooks nice if you like Euro stylingEasy to assembleLightweight- easy to pick up and moveSeat pad launders great and appears comfyConsTray difficult to get on and off- I couldn't manage that with one hand while holding babySafety strap stitching separated on crotch strap after a few uses. However, customer service was very helpful and promptly sent replacements for all strapsChair seemed unstable/tippy when baby got rambunctious and threw his weight around!Chair pad easily slides off the seatback when baby is in chairThis isn't a ""bad"" high chair, but I'd return it if I could. It didn't work for me, or my grandson.",2
"Combi 3 in 1 Hero High Chair, Wasabi","We bought this highchair for our first child based on look (not too girl or boy) and price (mid-level).  It appeared to do all the right functions and was great while our little one was little.  Once she started to grow we realized a lot of our mistakes.  The apple set-in plate became an annoyance since she could remove it and when it was not there and the raised edges where it goes limits the plate size, toys, and coloring you can do in the highchair (my husband built a tray to go over the apple so she could color in the chair).  My husband has also taken both the tray and the chair apart to fix the interior latch mechanisms, as they have both broke from use (and we don't use it that much).  As others mentioned, the strap clips are so tight that you can really pinch your fingers if not careful and the grandma's find it too difficult to use with arthritis.  I would have given the chair a 1 star, but I guess since we have lived with it for 2 years now, I will give it 2 stars.  The chair recline broke again today and that is it, I am excited to get a new one.  And this time I am doing my research!",2
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Dee Dee the Dragon","I absolutely adore the Lamaze toys!  Dee Dee is the fourth or fifth in Lamaze toy in our collection and she's just as sweet as the others.  Our two month old is at the point where she's looking but not yet really touching toys, but the colorful Lamaze toys seem to catch her attention.  I can't wait until she is able to discover all the different sounds and textures on her own!",5
Koala Baby 4 Pack Receiving Blankets - Boy Assortment,"These blankets are WONDERFUL!  ESPECIALLY if you want to swaddle your baby.  The blankets are rectangle instead of square, this helps to keep the ends tucked in.  I still use them to tuck in my toddler, the large size continues to come in very handy.",5

Disney Princess ~ Baby Girl Memory Book ~ &quot;Our Little Princess&quot; Pink,"This is a pretty little baby book!  There's room for pictures, firsts, etc. and it's got a lot of detailed areas for baby's &#34;firsts&#34;.  The only thing I don't like is that the binding is on the smaller side.  So it's not going to fit the baby's first birthday or holiday cards.  It would be nice to have extra space or a way to add pages but for the price, it's a very pretty book.  I really like it!",4
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,These are great -- so far :D.  The adhesive is strong and the mechanism sturdy. No little one is getting in my fridge or cupboard again :D,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son is using this potty chair for two months already. He love it! The sit is comfortable and provides support. Depends how big is your child, she or he may need some support if they are not able to sit alone. It is easy to clean. This product has good quality.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Babies love music and this worm is so cute and much larger than I thought, which is a good thing!!",5
Potty Pee Wee - Boy Potty Training Doll,"UPDATE: I wanted to update my previous posting. It has now been about two weeks since starting potty training with this product and my son is fully potty trained! One accident in the last week. We only had to use the doll twice and my son was excited to potty train. It was easy!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My son is two years and seven months old and has shown no interest in potty training. I understand the importance of not forcing a child who is not emotionally ready however, in  eight months if he is not potty trained, he will not be able to join a Montessori preschool with his sister until the next school year when he is four. A week ago, this situation encouraged me to find ways to make him interested on his own. I read several articles and combined all of the ideas I thought were the best.I bought him underwear (big boy pants) with animal characters he liked.I printed out a free potty sticker chart and bought star stickers for when he used the potty successfully. When he fills it out, he will get a small toy.I bought jelly beans for successful use of the potty.I bought a couple of child potty books that told stories he could relate with (My Big Boy Potty by: Joanna Cole) (Potty by: Leslie Patricelli)I bought this Potty Pee Wee Doll.We named this doll Sammy and my son taught him how to use the potty. We pointed out his body parts and the water bottle inside has a nipple-like piece we said that is where the pee-pee comes out. Then I said I think Sammy needs to go potty and my son sat him on the potty. The pee comes out when you squeeze its belly.  Beware it leaks but the doll is washable and its not like you keep him full of water all the time. Over all, I think all of these products played an important part and my son is now interested in and successfully potty training. Four days ago, he refused to sit on the potty or wear underwear. Now, he is making two ""pee-pees"" in the potty daily because he wants to. I do not pressure him. He still has accidents as expected but I am rating this product on its ability to help my son to become interested in using the potty. It worked and we will continue to use these techniques.",4
Philips AVENT Express Food and Bottle Warmer,"it is good, though its not what i thought. i expected it to  cut automatically in order not to overheat the bottle, but it doesnt work like  that. my fault i didnt get to know well about its working before buying.",2
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"I got this for my daughter who was 5 months old at the time. She loves to jump in it. She likes all the little attachments that she can grab onto, especially the bird and frog that hang overhead. She likes it with or without music.The only negative about the product would be that it does take up a fair amount of room. We have it in a large room, so it's not something that bothers me specifically, however if you have a small space you might want to take that into consideration.",5
Piyo Piyo Yellow Baby Nail Scissors,Work very well for little tiny baby fingers. I feel confident using them on my baby from when he was one month old and up.,5
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue","Baby Einstein jumper was useful. Combines teaching little ones how to hold up their own weight, helps to strengthen their legs with the bouncing motion, while entertaining them at the same time. We liked it. Putting it away was a little bit of a pain but once you learn how to fold it, no big deal after that.",4
Munchkin Cleaning Brush Set,"These brushes are very small, I wanted to replace a small brush I use to clean inside the motor of our Drinkwell pet fountain. These were way too small.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"I used this gym for my first child without incident, and he loved it. However, when my second son was 4 months old he gagged on one of the pieces. I laid him on his back to play and moments later heard him gagging. The blue spinning part of the parrot hanging toy was completely inside his mouth and he couldn't turn his head. Luckily nothing serious happened, but I wanted other parents to be aware of this potential problem. Fisher-Price is a very nice company to deal with. I sent the toy back and received a voucher.",3
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White","I can never get this to fit on my Pack N Play correctly. It seems too narrow - the waterproof area does not cover the entire sleeping surface. I haven't had trouble with it coming off or leaking, so functionally it is okay, but it gives a sort of lumpy appearance to the sleeping surface.",3
KidCo Convertible Crib Bed Rail Finish: Natural,I looked for weeks for a crib converter kit but kept finding they were super expensive. I wasn't about to spend $150 or more to concert my sons crib. Eventually I found this one and was shocked at all the great reviews and the price. Its true that it comes unfinished so you can paint it whatever color you want.  The instructions can be a little difficult and they should invest in re-writing them and placing identifying stickers on the pieces but otherwise with a little trial and error we figured it out and my son LOVES it. Its sturdy and safe when installed properly. Best converter for the price.,5
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,Millie's are THE BEST! They have save so much of my milk that would have gone into a nursing pad otherwise! Sometimes I even get close to 2 ounces in one feeding! I have stashed away a good amount of milk in my freezer now! Thanks milkies!,5
Nightstar Contour Changing Pad,"I bought this pas when I was pregnant and thought it was very well made.  My baby is now 6 months old and the pad is indeed great, well made and still look brand new.  Cleans very easily since it's waterproof and the price is right. Would buy it again.",5
"Evenflo COuncey 3 Pack Glass Bottle with Sleeve, 8 Ounce, Colors May Vary","I use these bottles to send expressed milk into daycare for my son.  I had looked at some of the other brands for glass bottles (we had been previous Dr. Browns users) but the pricing was prohibitive.  My son doesn't seem to have any issues with excess air consumption using these bottles and they're priced so much better!  I love the silicone wraps - although I'd suggest taking them off for washing.  Once you get used to putting them on and off they're not a hassle.  We've also dropped these bottles a couple times while washing, and none have broken - so a thick borosilicate glass bottle apparently is real tough!",5
New Mommy Advice Cards -24ct- Party Supplies,These cards were very sweet. I hope that my daughter always keeps them for the wonderful advice her loved ones gave her!,5
Cotton Tale Designs Pirates Cove Musical Mobile,Mobil is very beautiful fast shipping I am very pleased with my order A+ definitely completes the look it is a must,5
Econobum Full Kit,"The inserts fluffed up so much after the recommended 5 washes. I can't say how well the system works, but I got them for a gift for my sis. Once the baby fits into them, and she starts using them, I will update my review. Being a former recent cloth diaper user, I would say that I would definitely have used these. I used some not so great diapers and made them work, but I feel these would have fit the bill for affordable and meeting/exceeding my expectations. For the price and the way the inserts fluffed up, I would definitely recommend these to friends.",5
Sassy Baby's First Toys,"I would call this box of toys mediocre here's the good and the bad.Good:1. My son's favorite toys came from this box.  Even now at 7 months, he loves the teething bird, the rattle and the pig that came instead of the ducky.2. Thank goodness for the letters! Not only were they fun-textured, but we used them to hang the toys on his play gym lower.3. Several of the toys have been pretty well abused and show no signs of wear.4.It's a nice variety of easy-to-throw-in-the-diaper-bag toys - small enough he can carry them with him into the carseat.Bad:1. Definitely did not get all the toys in the picture, no ducks, no octopus, and didn't get the thing in the picture with what looks like 3 stuffed cubes.  We did get a stuffed pig on wheels that is not in the picture, and one rattle instead of one of the ones in the picture, but it's definitely less overall.2. The letters came in handy, but really aren't fun toys.It's probably not worth $39.99 - I got it as a gift and would say it's worth $19.99 - so maybe pick it up if you can find in on sale.",3
"Graco LiteRider Stroller, Lively Dots","It works very well with graco infant car seat. it protect my kid from wind, rain and sun. We also light the light weight. we have it for 20 months and put about 100 miles on it but still works great. it's made of plastic though.",5
"Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, Yellow","I was unsure about spending so much money on a placemat for eating out.  But I must say, after using it a few times, it is FANTASTIC!  I can pull it out of the diaper bag and stick it right to the table.  There is a place to catch all the food that falls, and clean up is a cinch.  It rolls up and folds into itself for easy storage.  A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAMILY THAT EATS OUT!",5
"Joovy Caboose Too Ultralight Stroller, Black","This stroller is perfect for my 4 month year old and 2 &1/2 year old. It feels like a single stroller (sometimes people I walk by laugh when they realize I have two in there because you can't tell because the stroller is non bulky) but has the back area for when my toddler doesn't want to walk or wants to ride on the platform. It handles great, great sun protection, easy to put together (and I'm terrible at putting things together and I could do it), and I love that its so narrow. I really REALLY love this product.",5
Munchkin Bath Super Scooper Turtle,"This is such a great solution for storing bath toys and letting them drip dry without taking up too  much space. Other reviewers complained about the adhesive strip... we never had any problems for the 1.5 years we used it. More that we couldn't get it off easily when we moved (not complaining!). It's now hung up with a few Command strips, which also work.It's nice that we can tell our sons to clean up after themselves in the tub, and it's no big deal. The turtle &#34;chomp-chomp-chomp's&#34; and all picked up. Plus it's compact and cute looking.Worth the purchase. If somehow it broke (which two boys under 4 haven't done yet) I'd buy another in a heartbeat.",5
"Britax Boulevard 70 Convertible Car Seat, Silver Birch",I love this car seat.  My daughter is now three years old and it is taking a licking and still ticking or protecting more importantly.  The only issue is that it was too big to fit in my 2002 Hyundai Sonata :-(  so it stays in my husbands car...and I'm the one who loves zebra print...Oh well.,5
"The First Years Deluxe Reclining Feeding Seat, Dots",I like this high chair. I got it for my 6 month old son and it seems to work great! I have no complaints!!!,4
"Protect-a-Bub Single Compact Sunshade, Black","I use this everyday for my baby's Maclaren Quest.  It works pretty well.  It's easy to put on and off, and most of the time you can just keep it on when folding the stroller too.",5

Samsung Wireless Video Security Monitoring System,"Incredibly this item worked perfectly for about an hour and then started making interference, even when the monitor and the camera were next to each other.I checked with Samsung tech department and they told me to return it...",2
"Kidz Delight Smooth Touch Tablet, Fun N Play",Not worth the money. Definitely not a &#34;tablet&#34;. It's a pad with buttons. Very limited entertainment for toddlers. I normally do extensive research before I buy anything online but bought this in a rush for my son. What a disappointment. I wish I had done more research. My fault.,2
Baby Trend Expedition ELX Travel System Stroller - Everglade,"We live in downtown Boston so we wanted a stroller that can handle city living that includes cobblestone sidewalks and lots of potholes when crossing the street.  I have to say I'm pretty disappointed so far with the stroller.  Our baby is only 3 weeks old so I'm willing to give it a few more weeks but if I can't fix the problems I'm returning this.Pros:This stroller definitely passes the looks test which is why I bought it in the first place (plus it came highly recommended by the sales woman at Babie's 'R' Us.Love the storage compartment underneath.  Super convenient.Cons:The much discussed front wheel.  The manual says to tighten the nut on the front wheel.  We've done that 3 times already and after 1 use it loosens right up.  When the front wheel is too loose it wobbles like no other, especially when you on bumpy sidewalk terrain.  The wobble is pretty violent as well...(see below youtube video from another user.)  Somebody suggested replacing the washer with a 5/8"" neoprene washer.[...]The seatbelt straps are not the easiest to use.  You actually have to overlay the 2 sides before clasping the seatbelt in which is a royal pain in the butt.It's extremely bulky but I can't complain too much about that since i assume all the joggers are like this.I'm pretty sure there are better strollers out there....",2
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","as described and good build quality.  assembly took about 15 mins.  1 person can assemble, but 2 people will make it easier and faster.",5
Personalized Baby Blanket,I adore this blanket and my friend's new baby does too!  It's so soft and kept him company in his 6 week stay in the NICU.  All the nurses commented on how soft and cute the blanket was.  The shop seller was also very pleasant to work with.,5
Medela Starter Supplemental Nursing System (SNS) Sterile M#00902 without 80ml Bottle,I had numerous problems nursing my son. This feeder helped us both tremendously! I actually used it even after all of our nursing problems subsided. It helped with supplementing in order for us both to sleep a little longer at night when he was a month old.I have recommended it to many moms that have had nursing problems or in need of something to help supplement without using a bottle.,5
"Badger Basket Covered Convertible Cedar Sandbox with Two Bench Seats, Natural","Just like 80% of the previous reviews, I strongly suggest that you replace all 12 hinges with new, thicker hinges.  Otherwise, this sandbox was super easy to put together.  There is no bottom in this sandbox so I made sure to put down landscape fabric to prevent weeds from growing up in the sand.  In doing so, when it rains the water will flow through the sand into the ground.",4
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Blue Kitties",This works like it's supposed to and wraps aroundthe straps so my baby doesn't have to have saftey belt marks on his tender neck.  Nice & cushy.,4
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Green","Our son first HATED this thing. We put him in his aunts excersaucer, and he loved that. The problem was at the 3-4 month stage, the bouncer was too big in the seat and he wobbled too much. The bouncer springs made him feel unstable and insecure.BUT.. after about 4 months he took a liking to it. At first I forgot to install the wheels to help the seat turn, so he hated it. I had put them aside thinking i will do it later (busy dad, ran out of time), forgot. Moved. Wife came by with a ""what are these??"" .. installed them instantly, put him in, and he could now easily turn.He absolutely loves it. He will play by himself in it, or interacting with us for 30 minutes to an hour. He gets so crazy with the jumping on this thing. He is now 6 months and still loves it. He sounds like hes running when hes jumping (alternating feet like hes working out). He loves the toys, especially when we hang up his favorite toys.Now.. on to the downsides of this:1: 1 of the piano keys is broken or sticks and cant be pressed by an infant.. which is a bummer, its the Blue key, and it seems blue and green have the LEAST annoying songs. Whereas red (the most often pressed on) has the most annoying :)2: the toy plate had 1 toy (the green clacking turn thing) that is just too hard for a little one to spin. Our niece commented on how it was stuck, and shes 4.3) the Sun is too hard. Too many times he pulls the sun forward to chew on, then bounces and hits himself in the eye. Next time I see, it, its coming off4) Seat is large, and leg holes are spread apart. Sometimes hard to get the child in (especially when theyre grabbing at toys while you struggle with their kicking and excited feet).Positives:1) Its heavy and large. I have caught myself using it as a footrest, and it doesnt even look like its under load. I bet this frame could support 100 lbs. I wouldnt try it, but good to know it can grow with a 30lb baby.2) Extremely adjustable - aside from the seat - you can move it up on 5 settings. Better than some of the other brands with only 3 or so settings. Plus unlike some excersaucers, the springs adjust with height. Meaning, if youre on 1, the springs are loose. So a lighter/smaller child can enjoy it. If youre on 5, the springs are more tight, so a larger child gets same enjoyment out of it. Unlike others where theres merely a height setting, but 1 weight setting.3) Numerous spots to hang toys. You can get the little rings and hang your childs favorite toys. And then alternate them to keep it fun and exciting.4) the frog toy/mirror combo is great. He loves to use this as a handlebar and get some air, and then peek at himself in the mirror.5) music is not overly loud, and actually has long versions of classical songs. A few i love, and its a treat when he plays them ;) There are 8 different songs, with 3 versions of each song in different tones. Plus theres a piano mode, however usually the blue key seems to not respond as easy as it should..6) Small details like beveled/raised images. As your baby starts to be able to discover things like that, the small things like that will help bring a new developmental stage. Now our son likes to play with the little einstein beveled logo and studies how it feels on his fingers.7) Great livingroom clothesline for trying off burp cloths and bibs :)...It does fold up, but its solid and massive. It does look like something that is built to last for a few children. Our little man absolutely loves it, but remember, they will hate it while they get used to the lack of stability (and it wiggles). Stick with it, few minutes here and there. Then sooner or later you with here the pitter patter of them jumping.Richard Simmons would be proud at the amount of workout they get with this.and yes, had eveyrthing worked, it wouldve got 4 stars. Regardless, I would buy this for anyone i know even if i knew there would be a few bugs with the toys.",4
Child Airplane Travel Harness - Cares Safety Restraint System - The Only FAA Approved Child Flying Safety Device,Did not have any problem with installation.Easy to use and kept my two years old boy safe in place the entire time.He even slept the whole time even tough he had the restrain on.Passengers behind us never complained. I would definitely recommend it to everyoneTraveling with toddlers/infants.,5

Medela Compatible Breast Pump Tubing - Tender Tubes ( 2 Packs in one package) - For Pump in Style Original and Advanced Breast Pump - BPA Free,The tubing is exactly the same as what's sold by Medela and it fits my Pump in Style Advanced perfectly. It is a set of two in plastic packaging as pictured. Does the job!,5
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,"This duck is perfect for our daughter. It has grooves in the bottom to prevent falling, it has suction cups to stick to the tub (if you want), and you don't have to fill the whole tub. You save water by using this. She weighs about 17 lbs and still has room to use this.",5

SoftShells Breast Shell Soothers - Sore Nipples,"These shells gave me instant relief from sore nipples associated with breastfeeding. However, know that breast shells can increase milk production (ask your lactation consultant or doctor, or just Google it). This may be fine or even welcomed for some mothers, but for me, it was an undesired side effect. Still, because they worked so well, I'd definitely use them again!",5
Evenflo Bounce and Learn Bee Exersaucer,I got this for my three month old and he loves it! There are lots of toys to play though he has not noticed them all yet. He can also touch the bottom of it with his feet on the lowest setting. It was easy to put together and came three days earlier then expected!,5
"ERGObaby Teething Pads, Cream",These do exactly what they're supposed to do and my baby loves to gum and gnaw them. They are little drool-covered pads and they're great because I can wash them and not the whole carrier. I also don't get wet when he drools all over them like I do when he gnaws on the actual carrier. I wish they came in more colors.,5
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"By the time I actually purchased this, around my eighth month, I was already used to sleeping on my side.  The problems I was having of basic discomfort and pain when sleeping were not helped by this product.  If I wanted to move at all I had to wrestle with it to move it and I still hurt all the time.  I guess by that point nothing would have helped.  It might be useful if you buy it very early on, though.",2
New Boba Wrap in Red with Matching Carrying Pouch : Infant Baby Carrier : Preemie - 18months (Previously Sleepy Wrap),I like the product- just feel too short for it at 5'2. Fabric length is also intimidating. Maybe not super suited for petites?,3
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"This blanket is worth getting. It doesn't absorb water easily which makes it convenient for when the grass is wet or humid and it folds nicely into a compact rectangle, making it easy to keep in your car. It is easy to clean too as the grass and mud doesn't stick to it. Just remember 5ft x 5ft is much more small than you would think. I wish I had gotten a bigger one.",4
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium","Normally we love these swaddlers-- I don't think my son could sleep with out them!  But this is now the second green one we've had (the first was in a smaller size) that was way too stretchy.  I have absolutely no idea why the color should matter, but we've had no problems with the blue fleece ones we got or the printed cotton ones.  These green fleece ones are so stretchy that it's impossible to get them tight enough around my son.  He can always manage to wiggle his arms up and out, which then wakes him up.  So, it's a great product overall, but something about the sage green ones just doesn't work!",2
"NUK Gerber GraduatesAdvance Hard Spout Sippy Cups, Boy, 10 Ounce, 4-Count",Love these ones. These gerber Nuk ones did not crack inside where the stopper goes like others I have purchased. They're also super cute.,5
"Tadpoles One Bulb Shaded Chandelier, Pink","I absolutely love the lamp, but was very disappointed with how unbalanced it is once installed.  I have several chandeliers in my home, and my husband is very handy.  Unfortunately, this one must be defective, because the whole lamp hangs to one side.  It was what I was looking for, but it's completely out of center.",5
Em's 4 Kids Hearing Protection Earmuffs Noise Protection (Silver),These are great.  Both my son's ages 4 and 2.5 use them all the time.We even took them to the movies for the first time and brought them along because it is so loud and they were happy and comfortable.Would recommend them to anyone.,5
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","I havent used yet because my son has mostly all his teeth! We ordered this for our unborn child...due in June, it looked interesting.. Its cute and looks like it will help. My son tried to open it and i guess eat it!",5
"Kissaluvs Diaper Lotion Potion 4 oz, Spray","I may be biased and/or uninformed as this is the only diaper spray that I have ever used, but I love it! In fact, my child does too. It smells great and really gets the stinkies off your baby's bum. Great product and I would definitely recommend it!",5
"My Brest Friend Adjustable Nursing Stool, Wood","This stool gets the job done, the grip strips keep your feet from slipping off and the adjustable angle is a nice feature. Only two complaints is ours didn't come with assembly instructions and that it would be even better if the height could adjust for different height furniture. Otherwise a solidly made product that works as it should.",4
"DaVinci Highland 4-In-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Chestnut with Natural","We purchased the Davinci Highland Crib/Dresser combo pieces separately from other websites where I found a better deal. I had a hard time finding many customer reviews for this set. I am not sure if it's too new or just not popular. It does seem to be a higher price point than a lot of the Davinci sets so maybe that it why. I find the set to be very good quality for the price, and very appealing.  From my search to find the perfect set for my baby, I learned that modern design seems to come with a higher price tag, regardless of quality. I liked the Babyletto line, but I really wanted a set that would grow with our daughter longer by getting a four in one crib.The Davinci Highland was the best I could find based on price, quality, and style. It took my husband maybe an hour to assemble. It feels very sound and sturdy. The main parts of the crib are stained a walnut color. The spokes of the crib are a much lighter pine color. The contrast is very stunning and unique in person.We purchased the conversion rails from Amazon right away as I have learned from research that many manufacturers discontinue them or offer them sporadically, and then you are stuck with a convertible crib you cannot convert! I think this will make a very attractive full size bed when the time comes.One drawback that I have noticed is that some of the bolts to the crib are visible -I know this is a common feature of lower priced cribs, but I feel this crib is in the moderate price range and they could have tried harder to conceal them. But, it's not a deal breaker.When we purchased the crib, we got a Davinci Twilight mattress for free, so I cannot speak to how well other brand mattresses might fit.I also wanted to note that, although we purchased the pieces separately, they are the exact same color, We did not have a problem with the stain being off or different since we purchased from two different retailers. I have seen others mention that they had problems getting pieces that match from the same retailer, so I thought this was a nice perk worth mentioning.",4
Winnie The Pooh - Peek a Pooh Wall Border,"My wife and I purchased this border to go with the rest of the nursery....We love the design, however, as with the other reviewer, the border did not stick to the walls at all...We followed the directions to a ""T"" and an hour later, it fell off the wall in a crinkled mess....We were able to put it back up with wallpaper adhesive, but it was quite a hassle.  You would think that at fifteen dollars a strip, the self adhesive would be a little more reliable.....",2
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","We own the newborn swaddling type, the cotton and the microfleece and love them all.  Very much like not having to bundle baby in blankets they can kick or wiggle out of!  We keep our home cool (62-65) year-round and these help keep babies comfy and safe all night long.  One of our new mommy diaper bags with all the promo stuff in it had one of these in a microfleece style!  From newborn thru crawling, these are great and now they make them with feet for older kids.  Kudos Halo!!  We tell everyone about these and give them as baby shower gifts.  Have seen other brands but we've stuck with Halo as they've held up through multiple washings w/o fail!!  Baby #2 is wearing baby #1's Halo's and they are still going strong and will be donated to a Goodwill as they still look that good!",5
Nuby Garden Fresh Fruitsicles,grandson really loved this and easy too use easy for young toddlers,5
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","We bought this gate so that our dogs cannot access the upstairs which is carpeted. All other &#34;baby gates&#34; that we have tried from Walmart and other stores where insufficient. The dogs could just jump right over them. Also, the kids would get tripped up on the gate and they were not able to secure the gate between the walls with enough tension so if an adult did not do it, it would just flop around and end up laying on the steps. The kids being the ultimate lazy creatures that they are, would just walk over and on top of the gate so they destroyed 2 before we purchased this one. This one is VERY sturdy! We have been using it for approximately 3 months now and it has not budged from between the walls yet. It is extremely easy to open and close and closes by itself after going through the door of the gate. It has handled impatient kids pushing on the door to open it and slamming it after exiting. The biggest plus though is the height! No dogs can scale this one!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I liked this for my 6 month old son because it plays music and lights up. You can also press a couple of the buttons together or seperate and it plays together. It's neat and my son enjoys it.,4
Baby's My First Photo Album of Family &amp; Friends,Great album for my baby. I like he can look at family an friends that are not around on a daily basis. And when his daddy deploys we can fill it with pictures of him. We can clean it up after he's drooled all over it.,5

Fisher-Price My Little Snugabunny Ultra Comfort Musical Gym,"I am impressed with this toy, and my baby enjoys it most of the time! I like the moving mobile with lights! It plays songs while the mobile is moving, or another setting is moving mobile, lights and music! The music is annoying in my opinion, it is too crazy for little babies! I wish there was a setting for just lights and mobile, but no music! Other than that we like it!",4
Keekaroo Height Right Tray - Plastic Cover Quantity 1,"We LOVE this addition to our Keekaroo seat.  Seriously a must have especialy for our messy eater that likes to fling food.  It saves us a LITTLE pick up, and when he's chasing Cheerios around the tray they don't fall right off!",5
"Evenflo Portable BabySuite 300, Marianna","This product annoyed me from the moment I took it out of the box.Assembly is horrible, and that &#34;bassinet&#34; (ha ha) is pointless.They did everything wrong here.

"Kate Aspen Set of 4 Assorted Place Card/Photo Holder, Whooo's the Cutest Baby Owl","My daughter loves these.  We ordered them for her upcoming birthday party to be part of her favors.

The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier,"We LOVE these clippers.  We've used them for two years now on my infant, who is now a squirmy toddler.  We recently replaced our pair that broke (because the two year old tore them apart...not the fault of the product at all!) and were desperately waiting for the new pair to arrive because regular &#34;adult&#34; clippers just don't work on those soft little kid nails.  These clippers allow me to get a close clip without fearing that I'm going to hurt my kid, even while he's wiggling.  My mom loves them too;  she's the mother of 5 grown children and has seen a LOT of baby clippers in her day...she says that none compare to these!",5

Sassy Counting and Spell Bath Appliques,"Maybe I had too many expectations when I've purchased these for my son. Overall they are a lot of fun to teach a child letters and numbers, but being a bath sticker they don't stick on very well. You have to apply pressure to get them to stay on the wall. My kid had troubles to do that. But sure he had a lot of fun throwing them around for me to pick up. I still love them.",4
Blowout Blocker Diaper Extension - Prevent Diaper Blowouts (Blue),"I saw this product featured in a baby magazine while pregnant and ordered one to see if it actually worked.  I didn't end up using it the first few weeks, but that quickly changed once my daughter had her first blowout.  Anyone who has ever experienced a blowout knows that they can be quite messy.  This product has a velcro strap in the front that keeps it in place and also allows for adjustment as the baby gets bigger.  It's important to secure this snug on the baby (and overlapping the diaper).  If it's not snug the blowout blocker tends to ride up on my baby, which creates a gap in between the diaper and the blocker, which defeats the purpose.  When it's on properly, it really does work, and prevents poop from getting on my daughter's clothes.  When my daughter does have a blowout, I just take off the blocker, rinse off the damage and spray it with stain remover right away and then toss it in with the rest of her laundry.  It comes out surprisingly clean and can be used over and over.  I rotate between a few and use them daily.  Even if you don't want to use it all the time, I think it's a great product to use for special occasions in case you are worried about a particular outfit getting stained (think holidays, baptisms, when you are out in public, etc).",5
2014 Ferrari Baby Beline SP 3-in-1 Car Seat in Red,Love the Ferrari brand.  When we unpacked this seat though I could immediately tell it was a Ferrari seat.  I could feel and see quality in the construction.  I'm sure it will last a long time.  Would have paid this much for just a booster but seeing how it's a 3 in 1 booster sure to get a ton of use and my money's worth.  My son loves it.  Says it's his racecar seat.,5

Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,"After having traveled with my 18 month old last year while I was 5 months pregnant, I swore I would never travel alone again. You would have to be an octopus to handle all the items you need as you make your way through the airport: Stroller, carseat, luggage, child - and you only have 2 hands!I found the ""Traveling Toddler"" on Amazon and am so thrilled I purchased it. As luck would have it, I had to travel with my now 3 year old and my 1 year old by myself, and certainly could not have done so without this device. With this simple strap, I was able to convert my carseat and carry on into a stroller and push it with 1 hand. The other was free to hold onto the 3 year old's hand.The device uses the LATCH system hooks from your carseat to strap onto your luggage. If you keep the top one hooked to the device, you can easily unstrap and restrap your carseat. I have a Britax Roundabout and it worked like a charm.This is a very inexpensive way to keep your sanity when traveling with a carseat.",5
The First Years Clean Air Diaper Disposal System,"I can see this product has not gotten great reviews, which surprises me.  We have two daughters and have been through several diaper pails.  Off the top of my head, I know we've used the Diaper Genie, Diaper Champ, plastic bags, and this.  This has been our favorite by far.Pros:1.  No smell.  Even as our daughter is getting older (now 18 months) and as diapers usually get smellier, we have had no problem with stench.  You really have to take them at their word and change the filter and the batteries every 90 days (we have every 3 to 4 months) like they say.  Which is much more than I can say for either Diaper Genie, which has a strong odor hovering around the entire thing.  I've sat right next to this thing when it was overfilled and couldn't detect even the faintest smell.2.  It uses regular trash bags, so you don't have to buy special ones.  It's simple enough to use that my four year old begs to be able to put the bags in for me.  And you're not grossed out by having to take out giant sausages of diapers strung together (You know what I'm talking about...)3.  The fan is so faint that you'd probably never notice.  (I slept in the same room with it a couple times, and in the dead of night, when I was listening for it, I could hear it.)4.  You can fit several days of diapers in it.  You don't have to empty this thing every day or every other day.  And it beats filling up old grocery bags with diapers that you have to take out every single time.  (Tried that too after we were wallowing in disappointment from the diaper genie and hadn't yet bought something else.)Cons:1.  Price.  Purchasing both the container and the filter and D batteries can be pricey.  It's been worth it, though.  We spend less on it than we did on the diaper genie when you consider how much those refill packs are.2.  The container does tip over if you try to lift the lid (the full lid.  You only have to do this when you're emptying it.  You only lift half the lid when you're using it) and leave it there.  But it's a rather simple thing to lift the lid with one hand and pull out the bag of diapers with the other.  And we've never had a problem with it tipping over otherwise.3.  Price.  Oh yeah.  I already mentioned that.  Really, it's the only mention-worthy drawback, in my book.",5
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","I've been using these for almost a year and they are very helpful.  My 5 year old uses them for snacks regularly, we've used them for sandwiches, etc for the rest of us, and we've used them for baby stuff like pacifiers and teething gear so they stay clean.  We've cleaned them by just rinsing out the inside with soapy water and letting it air dry, but we've also ran them through the washer and dryer with our kitchen cloths and haven't had any problems.  They come in really cute prints, too!",5
2 Sensor Infant Movement Monitor,"It is a very useful device. I strongly recommend to all new parents so that they can sleep with no concern or leave their baby alone. When we started to use this device, we got some false alarms during night and we were really afraid of this case. However, it was due to distant placement of the sensors. when the sensors are apart from each other, sensors may not perceive the movements of the baby since she is too little. After we put the sensors together in the middle of the bed, we didn't get any false alarm. No negative side of the device. Good price, high quality, efficient work.",5
"LA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32&quot;, White","I bought this and secured it to the top of a dresser type piece of furniture.I really like the four sides-makes it feel safe and secure.I've only used it for a few days now, as our boy is just 4 days old.I like it a lot so far, if i see it differently after awhile i will update my post.",5
"Boppy Noggin Nest Head Support, Brown Wheels","I noticed my son's head was getting flat on the back. My husband and I tried repositioning his head day and night with little results. When he is at daycare it's hard for the caregivers to constantly keep him off the back of his head. When we took him to the doctor for his 2 month check up the doc noticed his flat spot and said we may have to discuss a helmet at 4 months if there's no improvement. I was terrified that my baby might have to wear a helmet. I started to research these type of products and found the Boppy Noggin Nest. After 1 week we seen some improvement. It has been 4 weeks now and at his 4 month check up yesterday, the doc couldn't believe how much his head has improved and said no need to discuss the helmet. I use this in the swing, car seat, bouncy seat, crib, play gym, etc. This pillow is wonderful! I can't recommend it enough!!!",5
"KF Baby Diaper Bag Insert Organizer (9.6 x 5.6 x 7.2 inch, Black)+ Diaper Changing Pad Value Combo","I expected it to fit a DIAPER BAG seeing as how it is called a diaper bag insert....but it hardly fits a purse... guess i should have read the fine print for dimensions, I learned my lesson!",2
Bee Safe Belt (Blue),"My daughter was always getting out of her car seat, Bee Safe Belt protects my daughter. What is better than that? I was really starting to get scared of how easily she could get out, now she has no luck escaping :). I will defiantly purchases more as gifts and refer to friends, thanks so much!",5
Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,"This little Mobi is great! My two year old loves it and I can safely let him hold it without worrying about him getting burnt because it is too hot. It works as a great night light, especially in the bathroom. I love that it goes on when there is a power outage and give you another flashlight. However, it won't truly light a room, but it is better than nothing. I left the thing off teh base AND ON overnight. It was still glowing well after 15 hours off the charger.My one complaint is that the directions say it takes 8 hours to get a full charge. Mine didn't reach full charge status until well after 24 hours.",4
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","The brush is perfect for cleaning inside my Dr. Brown's bottles, until you take the brush out.  I was surprised with a spray of water splattering all over me!  My kitchen sink isn't very big, so I tried to do it low and sideways so I wouldn't get sprayed, but when I did that, my counter would get sprayed.  The nipple cleaner works well and the stand is nice, but due to the spraying nature of the bottle brush, I deducted a star.UPDATE (9/22/12) - These brushes do not last, i had to purchase another one since the top bristles of the brush eventually get flattened which renders it useless.  The second one just bit the dust.  I am not trying out other brushes, the Philips Avent one and Dr. Browns to see which one will last.",3
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"The bottes came fast, very util and practical. Easy connect other medela products, then you can change botle to Medela Special Needs, : )",5
"Britax Advocate 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I love this carseat and so does my daughter. We have an SUV and it fits well. It is a large carseat so be sure it will fit in your vehicle. I did go to a store that sold them and tried her out in it before purchasing to make sure she was comfortable. It did take some adjusting in the car to get it level but in the end it fits great. I like that it has two options for the crotch strap - most carseats do not. Also, the secure latch *click* let's me know I have her in there perfect which I love. She looks tiny in there right now ( at 9.5 months she is 22lbs and 27 inches tall) and I love that she can stay rear facing for an extended period and that she can sit in this seat up to 70lbs. I have a mirror attached to the seat so I can see her in the rear view mirror which helps. It drives me crazy when I see a photo of a friends baby an Facebook with their child's strap hanging off their shoulder. That's not safe at all!!  I also loved the lower price offered by Amazon. Great purchase and great and safe carseat.",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Although ""The First Years 5 in 1 Carry Me Near Sleep System"" isn't washable, overall, I didn't have a problem with the design, but unfortunately, the quality of the fabric and the poor craftsmanship warranted my returning it. Regarding the craftsmanship, in my opinion, the quality of the sewing and stitching is way below grade, and the absense of bar tacks is a clear sign of cost cutting. If you're looking for a heirloom piece, The First Years 5 in 1 Carry Me Near Sleep System isn't for you, for sure.",2
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo,Our child loves spending time in her &#34;office&#34;.  The only down side to this device would be that it sit high off the ground for a 6 month old.,5

The First Years miPump Double Electric Breast Pump,I originally had a different brand product that gave out after about 1 month of use.  I returned it and got a refund and decided to try the miPump.  I started with the single unit and loved it so I bought the double unit and it has worked wonderfully.  I did rent a professional grade unit from my peds office but it was so bulky and definitely not able to take with you in the car (no batteries)and I ended up giving it back because this one worked as good if not better and has the ability to take with you wherever you go.  Just make sure you have several batteries if you are using the battery feature as it goes through them rather quickly.,5
Baby Rear Seat Car Mirror - For Rear Facing Baby in Back Seat - Easily Straps on and Secures to Headrest - Large Clear Reflective Adjustable Convex Mirror - Keeps an eye on your Precious Cargo - 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed or Your Money Back!,Originally bought E. Bauer from Target but it wouldn't attach to headrest in our CX-5.  This mirror works perfect and gives a nice broad view of the baby.  Super quick and easy to install and it adjusts easily and will hold it's position perfectly!!!  This is a great product if you're questioning which mirror to buy.,5
Medela Nipple Shield Regular 24mm,"Since the day my little one was born, he had trouble latching on. After speaking to several lactation consultants and trying several positions and holds...nothing seemed to work to get my little one to latch on. I resorted to pumping and feeding him breastmilk from a bottle. I was in tears knowing that i was unable to breastfeed directly from breast. after much research and continous attempts to get the little one to latch i found the nipple shields to be simply phenomenal. he latches on so much better with the nipple shields. I plan on continuing using the shields until i no longer breastfeed.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,Purchased this after purchasing the Babybjorn Smart Potty because the other was too high at first. This one is just ever so slightly smaller and a much better fit for either small or early trained kids.,5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"I read so many reviews on so many different video monitors that I was dizzy! Every one of them had different things that people did not like. In the end I felt best going with the Infant Optics DXR-5. I bought it &#34;used&#34; on Amazon for about $70...an AMAZING price! I read the different ones available that were &#34;used&#34; and some had a scratch or were not in the original packaging. Mine came without any defect, damages, and in the original box. I have been using it every day for two weeks and so far - I love it! The picture quality is great in daytime lighting - so clear! The night vision  is also very clear when focused only on the crib. I have the camera set up to where it views almost the entire room... so empty areas of the room are a little pixel(ly) looking, but it is clear on actual objects and people. (hope that makes sense). My son's room is upstairs and this monitor works even when I am all the way down in the basement or in the yard! It was also important to me that the line/camera have 100% privacy..I have read that some monitors have picked up other video from neighbors' monitors! - This uses digital 2.4 Ghz wireless transmission that says it is 100% private in addition to using Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum for interference free connection. It also has an option that turns off the monitor when there is no noise (to conserve power) and it re-activates or turns back on when any noise is detected -  I should say I have not tried this. I have that feature turned off so that at night mine stays on so I can't say how well that feature works. The volume on the unit seems perfect to me - not too quiet- not too loud. As with any, there is a little bit of white noise when turned up high. That doesn't bother me because we sleep with a noise machine...Will report back if any problems arise in the future. But so far -SO happy!",5
"Chicco Cortina Keyfit 30 Travel System, Miro",Probably not the lightest travel system existing but so well made and stylish in the same time. You do need some space in your trunk... Very happy to have it!,5

Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"My daughter in law had one for her son's and recommended I purchase one for my other daughter in law to use on my grand daughter.  The Aspirator works very, very well.  There is a filter and a one way valve, so no worries about sucking in something you don't' want to!  Highly recommend for the little ones who are stuffed up.  Works great!",5
"Safety 1st Easy Grip Brush And Comb, Colors May Vary",perfect for the price. Needed simple brush. Note that they come in different colors than what you see in the picture- I got green and thought I was getting orange.,5
"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red",I purchased this stroller because it had a good rating and it has lived up to that rating. It was affordable and not as flimsy and cheaply made as the $20 strollers at my local Walmart. I needed something a bit more durable that my son wouldn't have a fit sitting and riding in and this stroller fits the bill.,5
Snuza Hero Baby Movement Monitor,"I purchased this product to help me sleep at night without wanting to get up and check my son every few minutes. It does exactly what it says it does. If the child stops breathing, the vibration goes off to try and wake the baby and after that the alarm goes off.If I was purchasing this device again I don't know that I would buy this model. I think I would buy the version without the vibration feature.Snuza Portable Baby Movement Monitor, Orange/White, 0-12 MonthsOurs has gone off several times, and the baby was breathing fine, but it didn't even wake him. So I don't feel the vibration does much.I only have 2 small complains about the alarm. First, I would like to see a different way of attaching the device to the child. My son moves around a lot when sleeping and the device slips off in the middle of the night causing the alarm to go off. The other problem is if your child sleeps on their side, the device may still be attached to their diaper but the tip will not be touching their stomach so the alarm will go off. I don't think there is much that can be done about that.As a side note, the first one I bought had a problem after 3 months. It still worked but you couldn't turn it off. I called and they replaced the device without any questions. I was able to keep the defective one until the new one arrived so I could continue to use it.",5
Baby Planet Unity Sport Stroller Red Tech,"I just received this stroller in the mail and am very happy with it. I am expecting my second son any day, and have an 18 month old son. I've already taken him for a couple walks in it, so he gets used to it and he really likes it. It's so easy to steer and turn, much easier than any other strollers that I tried out in Babies R Us. It is a little hard to fold up, but I've read other reviews that say after a few times of folding it, it gets ""worn in""  I highly recommend this stroller.",5
Sassy Terry Teethers 2Pk,"Best investment I ever made!  Yes it's essentially a washcloth but it's so nice to always have a specific frozen cloth ready for those fussy moments.  Honestly, with these frozen cloths I can get the serenity in a moment when I need it the most. Great item.",5

Kick Mats - Deluxe Car Seat Back Protectors 2 Pack - Keep Your Car Seats 100% Clean From All The Stains And Scuffmarks Left By The Kids With These Auto-Protective Seat Covers - Designed For Most Vehicles - Protect Your Investment - Lifetime Guarantee,"Great no-nonsense kick mats that I think would work for just about anyone and any vehicle!  I was on the hunt for some affordable and effective kick mats since my almost 3 year old has decided that putting her feet on the back of my new Odyssey seats is a great novelty. I was a little worried that these mats wouldn't work since I have handles on the back of my front seats near the top, but they cover those just fine and fit around the very wide seat bottom of my Minivan. These mats don't have any pockets or loops, but that's exactly what I wanted. I didn't want anything enticing my kiddo by drawing her attention....I want her to leave my seats alone. Perfect solution. I only took one star off because they are fairly thin and while I've only had these about a week, I can't speak to how well they will hold up long term.",4
"Graco Duo 2 in 1 Swing with Plug, Carlisle","I enjoy it, my baby boy love it, he feel comfortable when he ride it. Music good, ac plug in will save your money so you don.t have to buy battery.looks great. I think i made the right choice.",5
Botanical Multi 4 pc Toddler Bedding Set,"I received this item quickly and was very pleased with it. My 2-year old loves it, too. However, I did not receive the pillowcase. I have tried to contact the seller, but I have not heard anything back yet. It's a really great set, but be warned that you might not get all of it, and considering the customer service, it's possible you never will.",4
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","Our baby LOVES this mobile. When he was little, it was the only way I could leave him long enough to take a shower. Now that he's a little older (6 months), he loves to watch it before he drifts off to sleep. We could not live without it!",5

"NUK Learner Cup BPA Free Silicone Spout, Single Pack, Colors May Vary","I tried a bunch of sippy cups and this was the only one she not only liked, but quickly figured out how to use herself.  She's 8 months old now and I just bought the next stage... the EZ cup and I give her her formula in it now.  She's fine with it.  Lays there and relaxes.  I already ordered the Active cup for when she's a little older.  And I love that the spouts are interchangeable with the whole series!!!!",5
Rocking Moses Basket Stand Natural,We ended up using the bassinet of our stroller together with this rocker on a daily basis. I did not feel like running up and down to the second floor to put my baby down for a nap. We are planning to use our UppaBaby Vista stroller (great stroller!) together with this rocker for our second baby.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Got this a few days ago and set it up for our daughter to get acquainted with. She's 2 years old and was able to get on and off of it without any help or problems. I do wish it locked into the open position, but that's nothing major. We haven't used it for a full night yet, so the true test of time is yet to be determined. But, so far so good!",5
Levana LV-TW502 Safe N' See Advanced 3.5-Inch Digital Video Wireless Baby Monitor with Talk to Baby Intercom and Remote Controlled Lullabies,We read some reviews online and after reading about this product we decided to go for this!Works just perfect. . . You can adjust the sensitivity yourself and have full control over the baby sleeping. We love the little feature playing lullabies. . .Having the option to run the camera on batteries as well makes this product really good for people traveling and camping. !Pros:excellent picture day and night.. nightvision really works and is automatically managed by the camera.two-way communications...remote controlled night light - can turn it on and off without going into the room..remote temperatureremote music - can turn it on and off after you see your kid is asleeppower saving... remote monitor can be setup to be sound sensitive to only show screen when sound is heard (adjustable)Camera can be operated with battery.The LCD uses Nokia BL-5C battery!Cons:So far no bad.We recommend this product!,5
"Pampers Airwave Venting System, Stage 1, 5 Ounces, Clear, Triple Pack","I spent ALOT of money on these!! BIG WASTE!! Not only do they cause alot of gas but it doesn't help colic at all. When my daughter was drinking, the nipple would collapse back inside the nipple holder causing her formula to spill all over her face. I do not recommend. Plus the nipple is so big for a babys tiny mouth that formula just spews out the sides of her mouth causing yet another big mess! Don't waste your time. Save your money.",2

Playtex One-Step Breast Milk Storage Kit,"Singleton mama's pump half the milk as twin mama's.  The playtex adaptors resolve some serious logistics issues and make life easier.  When a twin mama pumps for 10 - 15 minutes, out comes 12 - 16 ounces, so you would fill 4 of those little 4 ounce bottles!  Not only do you ahve to stop pumping and switch half way through, but you have to store and combine twice the bottles!  Ugh!  I got tired of it all and went searching for a solution.I wanted a way to pump into a container that would hold everything that came out of each breast. I needed to pump into something that would hold 8 ounces.  And I discovered these and loved them!",5
Summer Infant Sure &amp; Secure Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate in Black,"I've been an avid Amazon customer for a couple of years now with many purchases under my belt. However, until now, I was never compelled to share my thoughts about any of my purchases because most purchases have generally met our expectations and nothing more.Well, I have to say that the Summer Infant Metal Gate has met AND exceeded our expectations. I did not know what to expect with this product having had old flimsy plastic gates in the past (for my kids). This product is not only aesthetically pleasing to the eye, but is extremely well designed and built. It is an all around solid product.We purchased this metal gate as well as Summer Infant's decorative wood and metal gate in preparation for our upcoming puppy. We are equally pleased with the wood and metal gateSummer Infant Metal and Wood Walk-Thru Gate. Obviously only time well tell if the gates will be able to withstand any punishment from our upcoming puppy.In terms of installation, it took a bit of time to adjust the gate in order to square it up properly, but once this was achieved the gate latches worked great and the gates stand firmly in place.We could not be happier with our purchase!",5
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","We purchased this Carseat for our 11 month old coming out of a Britax infant seat.  However, it wasn't the Carseat we bought first.  I tried to save money by buying the Combi Coccoro.  Both seats are known for being narrow for installation of three seats across the back of smaller cars.  The Combi Coccoro was really nice.  It installed quickly and was less of an investment.  Everything was great until we put our 11 month in it.  Her head was already too close to top.  So we returned the seat .  Best thing we did!  We went ahead and purchased the Radian for her.  The purple Radian RXT is perfect rear facing!  We did purchase the radian foam piece so that the front passenger seat did not have to be so far forward.  I was foolish for trying to save about a hundred bucks buying the Combi Coccoro.  i should have known better because we know how much we love the Radian.  Our four year old has been in one for 5 months now ( the sixth Carseat we have purchased for him in four years). I wish we had been able to purchase this as his first Carseat or at best second.  We now have two Radian RXT seats.  The only problem now is ...... We need two more for our other car to replace our Britax Marathon and Britax Frontier!!!  Yes, the Dionos have impressed me so much I am not as much of a Britax fan as before.",5

"Playtex Baby Binky Silicone Newborn Pacifier, 0-6 Months and above,Colors May Vary","It is true that you cannot pick color etc. I was sent blue pacifiers with little trucks on them. The blue was a nice color though, and these pacifiers are hard to find so I just removed the decal myself. They wear off after a while anyway. I will definitely be ordering these again because the shape of the ""nipple"" is unique and my girl won't even take the oh-so-similar Playtex Binky as a substitute.",5
Sleep Buddy ~ Sleep Training System for Toddlers &amp; Pre-schoolers,"If your kido is having trouble sleeping in. This is a great option. Our son fell in love with the reward system and the light it self. Having your kid storm in AFTER 7 am with a big smile with &#34; daddy daddy , my light turned off ! &#34; makes it worth every cent. Plus the little story book that goes along with it is a great introduction to the clock. 4/5 only because the  electronics on The little guy are a little cheap , but functional.",4
"Kid'Sleep Classic, Blue",I am usually pretty good at figuring out basic things...but after reading and re-reading the instructions (more than several times) I just couldn't figure it out.  I threw the clock in the garbage!,1
"Fisher-Price Baby's First Sippy, 2-Count",This has been the perfect sippy cup to help transition our almost 10 month old from  bottle to cup at meal time. It is easy for him to hold and the moving spout inside insures that he always gets water. Easy to assemble and take apart to clean. Very happy,5
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump Spare Parts Kit,"I wish I had ordered this when the pump was ordered! My husband was washing them out for me and ripped the piece that drips milk into the bottle. The pump won't work without it! So, I had to pump one side at a time until they came. Everyone who pumps should order this just to have!",5
"Dr. Brown's PreVent Design Pacifier, Neutral, Stage 2,  6-12 Months",This is the second time I am buying it. The teat is flat and I can tell my son prefers this shape to others.,5
"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","The cherry wood itself is very great, however, the painting is easy to be scratched during delivery and installation. Both the packaging & delivery should be more careful.The deliverer put it to my condo guard while I was at home, why not sent the huge heavy item directly to my door?",4
"Evenflo Serenade Infant Car Seat, Honeycomb Baja",This carseat is absolutely perfect. My twin sons were born very small and scrawny. I had this carseat and a $130 graco carseat. My twin in the graco carseat looked uncomfortable and his head kept was never secure and slumped. But in this carseat it had a cushion to keep the head up. It also a large sun visor that covers half the carseat. Did i mention it is well cushioned? With the twins i have 4 kids and so i know carseat well. This is one of the best carseats.,5
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","I don't have any stroller age kids, but to avoid further loss of coffee mugs off the top of my car I started looking for a cup holder I could attach to my Yakima roof rack. The Lionheart model I used for a year or more required extensive modification, and it wouldn't hold insulated cups unless the handle was open at the bottom, but it once carried a coffee mug safely from Bellevue to Seattle! After it broke I found the Valco, which attached easily and might even fit a square Thule cross bar. It seems a lot tuffer, and some closed handle mugs will fit. Best thing is I'll be the talk of the parking lot at the ski areas!",5
"Kidkusion Large Driveway Safety Sign, Yellow",Very happy with the sign. The sign is a great warning to all motorists to slow down.Children are near.We love having the bright yellow sign. So glad we made the purchase.,5
"Munchkin Baby Bath Ball, Colors May Vary","This toy looked pretty unimpressive to me, but my child was in the age-range listed on the packaging, so I picked it up because I needed a tub toy. Turns out, it's a deceptively clever little toy! The side with the cut-outs is flexible, so you can collapse it and it springs back into place - it's also easy for baby to grab. The other side has perforations so that baby can strain bathwater through it. And, like another reviewer mentioned, you can use it to gently rinse off soap suds - super handy! There's a clear plastic ball inside with little sea-shapes that rattle around as the ball rolls around inside the toy. For whatever reason, at my house, this toy isn't just for the bath! My daughter loves it and carries it all over the place so that I have to search for it at bath time. Now my husband has taken to keeping it in his car because she'll play quietly with it in her carseat - she shakes it a little bit and falls asleep! So that's it: I'm ordering more of these.",5
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Quarter Moon","Unfortunately, I am now in the market for a non rechargeable style night light for my 3 year old.After the mobi tyke lite failed in 3 mos, I now have had this Kinderglo for under a year.  While it still does work, about 6 mos after use, the pink is sputtery & the blue has faded.I typically leave on charger always. It is on about 12 hours a day. Sometimes it is bright still in the morning, other times it is very dark, looks like the battery is running down. I know that it is fully on its base, I have no idea why it does this.Nobody plays with it. The only time it is taken from its base is when I turn it on at night.I very badly wanted to like this.",2
Mobi Tykelight GloMate Plus,"I love this nap light, and so does my son. I would LOVE to give it a 5 star review, but I just can't.The naplight itself is fantastic. Safe, just enough light, lasts all night. HOWEVER, the charging station is terrible! It is very touchy  even when new. You have to get it on just so. Over time, it becomes harder and harder to get the position ""just right"". Ours is still pretty new and sometimes it takes me 10 minutes to wiggle it into the one perfect spot where it will charge.Before I purchased our Tyke Light, I read several other reviews that mentioned this problem. It is not just a problem with a few ""lemons"", it is a design flaw, and all lights will eventually stop charging.My daughter has the Munchkin puppy light, and it charges great. I would actually like the tyke light a little better than the munchkin if it were not for the issues with the charger. While it will take a charge it's awsome!",3
Summer Infant Deluxe Comfort Booster- Tan,"This seat is lightweight and portable, easy to clean and conveniently folds for storage. It's not super heavy duty and I wouldn't leave a child unattended, but for occasional use under supervision, this is a great buy!!",4
Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,"I'm a busy mom and I have tried 3 different bottle warmers. I must say that at the end, I came with the conclusion that it is much easier and faster to use hot tap water in the deepest bowl/mug you have. You fill the bowl up with hot water, put the bottle inside, and by the time you are done changing your baby's diaper the bottle is warm enough. You can shake the bottle to make sure there is no hot spots, and if it makes you feel better, test the temperature on the back of your hand. It's a low-tech but efficient method, and it works every time! :)",1
"Baby Cubes Baby Food Storage Contains no Phthalates, Bisphenol-A, PVC 2 Pack","I tried ice cube trays and nursing tubes.  I found this to be one of the best ways to store and reheat baby food.  It snaps tightly, stacks perfectly and stores neatly in my freezer.  I set it in the fridge the night before and microwave the food directly in the container, with the list open for ventilation.",5
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,"I put one of these on my toughest, hardest and most used area of my house. The pull out trash bin in our kitchen cabinets. The four girls, 5 and under, in my house constantly pull, tug and try to unlatch this thing. After a month of using it, it is still working and still attached to the cabinets.I have yet to try and remove one, and I have some concern about the ability to get all the glue off the cabinet when I do, or if it will be damaged. That is here nor there to me because I don't have to worry about an 18 month old draggin old nasty diapers out of the trash bin!Great find and definitely a good buy!",5
"Britax Boulevard 70 CS Convertible Car Seat, Biscotti","Bought two of these car seats for our twin girls. We have them rear-facing at 13-months old/ 21 lbs. Great pattern and soft material. The girls are comfortable in them and the straps don't seem to bother them at all. It's easy to get the seat out of the car; not as quick/easy to lock it back into the car (this may not be an issue if you only have one child/ one car seat and don't have to pull out the seat very often; plus this is probably an issue with any car seat because they are much bigger/bulkier than the snap & go's). Agree with other comments about visibility. They have to strain their little heads forward to see out the window or to see eachother. All in all, great seats. I would buy them again.",4
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","Not sure it is because our child is so lean, but we had trouble getting the harness tight enough. We followed instructions to a tee and are veteran car seat users. However, we still struggled getting the harness pulled tight enough and the tightening strap was really stiff/difficult to tighten. We would pull and pull and it barely moved.  Also, the release buckle was difficult for me to release with it being in the tiny fabric opening and you have to push the release button in and not up like the Marathon we currently have already.  We bought this for our 4 year old in hopes to use as a booster later. However, due to the strap issue, we had to return it for something else. We were surprisingly disappointed as we love all of our previous Britax seats. Otherwise, the seat is well made and very sturdy.",2
Fisher-Price Pink Sparkles Tub,"My mother in law bought this for us. It gets the job done, but even with the netting for the newborn feature, my baby doesnt lay securely in the tub. Making it difficult to bath her without someone elses help. I have to hold her in place with one hand the entire time becuase the net doesnt do exactly what it says it does.",3
"Graco UrbanLite Stroller, Rittenhouse","got this product 6 months ago and I still love it. My 5 year old was able to sit comfortably in it so I know it will grow with my 11 month old. I did a lot of research and found this to be the best stroller for the price. I was a little bummed I couldn't try it out in the store but still it had all the features I wanted.-only two front wheals.... not those stupid double things that get in the way-it has a metal bar for the back seat adjustment.... no strap to get tangled and I can do it with one hand. I think they did a good job with the angles it sits/reclines/lays at too.-large basket.... I'm able to take this to the rec center and fit towels, swim toys, clothes, shoes and lunch under for both my sons and I.-trays/drink holders.... I can have two large drinks for me and feed my baby his lunch on his tray.... plus I didn't have to pay $20 extra.-I can sling a large diaper bag over the back and it doesn't tip over.-large sun shade-straps... I was able to remove the shoulder straps (pointless!) and have a 3 point system for my baby.-small.... really, I can do SO much with this stroller for it's compact size-fits my graco safe seat!-wipes clean easily-can unfold with one hand... although it can be a bit tricky.-one lever to release the brakes..... I can even do it barefoot.-adjustable handle bar... I can push it in heals and I can lower it when my oldest wants to push.-screen sides on sun shade... keeps my baby from fussing because he can sit back and still see out!-Tray swings out so it's easy to change a diaper.-Folds compactly... It may not be as small as a umbrella stroller but with the handle bar folded under I can lay it on it's side in my suv and it takes up VERY LITTLE space.What I don't love-the color ran a tad when some water from the swimming pool got on it. I think it was the chemicals because I've wiped it many times since then and the color has stayed.-the sun shade can either be folded up, over your baby or released from the back and in the front of your child.... there is no 'middle ground.' because you have to release the shade by a velco tab on the back. It was a bummer when I found that out.-the black color. I liked the 'antique' look with the fabric and so did my husband (who is very particular about our boys not having 'girly' prints) but that changed once our baby had a snack.... man it looked dirty! The plus side is that it wipes clean very easily (I'm talking baby wipes in the middle of costco and 3 did the job)-lame 'tray' for adults. Really, they could have put a larger one it.... you don't need an open area to fold it. I think the little tray is for a smart phone because mine fits perfectly. I don't mind the small tray so much because I just put things in my purse I hang on the back.All in all I would still buy this stroller again. I really do love it.",5
"BabyKicks Set of 3 Nursing Pads, Fleece","These are by far the best washable nursing pads I've found so far. I am a rather heavy leaker, so it's been a challenge to find washable pads that work, but I can't stand the idea of throwing away all those disposable nursing pads. These aren't perfect (they definitely aren't invisible under a thin bra or nursing tank, but I have yet to find anything that is), but they contain leaks very well and feel nice against the skin. I like them enough that I'm planning to order a few more sets.",4
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,Bought two as baby shower gifts - I used a chair called a &#34;sassy seat&#34; when my boys were young and LOVED it so this is my go to gift for all baby shower gifts.This chair is more a Cadillac to the one I used back-in-the-day.,5
SoHo - Sage Diaper bag with changing pad 6 pieces set,"Great size, nice color, everything fits perfect.Would definitely recommend to others.Anyone who purchases this item wont regret it.",5
Prince Lionheart Stroller Gate Check Bag,"I highly recommend the Prince Lionheart Car Seat Check Bag and Stroller Check Bags! I was traveling alone with my 10 month old baby and 9 year old and was able to carry this easily along with my baby in a front carrier and baby bag (and the Car Seat Check Bag when we had to switch to a different plane!!). I ended up using this for a gate check bag and in no way or any form did it get destroyed. It has minor scuffs now that I used it on two trips, but it held up well and did not tear or break. I was able to fit my Chicco Nuevo Stroller in it, though the wheels did hang out. I may be my stroller though because when it folds the wheels are on both ends vs. one. But even though they hung out, it was easy to roll it around when I needed to, There are two handles, one hand and another for over the shoulder making it very easy to carry and maneuver. There is a drawstring to secure the tie and it can fold up into itself when not in use. It does take a moment to get the stroller in, so make sure you get it in before you board and present it to the desk. I didn't use it as a checked bag, but based on the construction I don't think it would rip or tear.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"While this chair works fine, it's just not comfortable.  My son's little bottom is so red after just sitting on it for a short time!  He ends up either standing for some relief or moving around the chair in an attempt to find a comfortable position.  If I had to do it over again, I would buy something with a cushy seat.  Wouldn't buy this one again...",2
"Bright Starts Rattle and Shake Barbell Rattle, Pretty in Pink",i got this for my grandson.  he loves to shake it and put it in his mouth.  i guess he likes it!,5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","My 18 month old absolutely loves his new backpack. It is the perfect size for him, and he can fit a few stuffed animals and some books inside. He walks all around the house wearing it. The one I received is definitely from Skip Hop.",4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,my little baby loves this thing! perfect for any newborn up through many months old.  great for entertaining your little ones!,5
K's Kids Deluxe Patrick Shape Sorting House,"When my baby was little this was a wonderful toy to learn shapes & sorting. It is so cute! Plus, the roof has a dogie on it & on the other side a mirror.Now, years after I received it from my sister who bought it in Europe, it remains one of the favorites. My baby likes to play with different small animals, & this now makes the perfect house for various families of animals. Great for pretend & play games for the older children. Overall, the educational & fun value is outstanding. And the quality of the materials used is rare nowadays.",5
"Naturepedic Organic Cotton Bassinet Fitted Sheet, Ivory",It fits great.  It is super soft. I wish it fit on my bed. Washes great. I Iove that it is made in the USA.,5
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","Excellent bottle brush.I've had the pink one for over a year, using it on a daily basis. At first I had no idea how to use the nipple cleaner (which is a great feature), but once my wife showed me it was able to get in many crevices in my daughter's bottles.We primarily use the Avent bottles, and this brush is perfect. Despite how soft the bristles may feel, they really clean the bottles and attachments thoroughly. At first I thought the colored bristles were tougher, but upon closer inspection I think they're colored just for show. But the quality is overall top notch.The stand is nice in that you can detach the bottom for cleaning, and there's a little hole and lip to let the water out.Got blue this time, and will probably get another color in a year if I'm still cleaning bottles daily.",5
"Bunnies by the Bay Wee Plush, Emmie","Adorable, soft,and well made. Shipped quickly, would recommend. A must for Bunnies by the Bay collectors. You will not be disapointed.",5

Beco Butterfly II 2 Baby Carrier Natalie,The product is so soft and the only thing sometime that will put the baby to sleep when she is fussy. We are going to order another one!,5
"Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 3 (Pink, Purple, White)",Purchased these to use with my Osocozy cloth diapers and they work as they were intended. They are easy to use and make it easier to put a diaper cover on over the diaper.  No complaints.,5
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White",We're pleased with the quality and the ease of installation.  Guests also have no problem opening and closing these gates.  May purchase another...,5
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"We purchased this along with the Graco Snugride 35 for our daughter who was born a year ago and it is hard, looking back, to think of another piece of out-and-about baby gear (other than a carrier/sling) as useful as this one.  At the basic level, it's great because you can steer it one handed even when it's loaded up and you can access the generously sized storage basket even when the carseat is in place (you'd like to think that this would be true of any stroller or stroller frame; sadly no).  You can collapse it one handed, open it one handed, and put it in the trunk with one arm (because it's so light).  ""Can I use this one-handed?"" is a great way to screen ANY piece of baby gear.More than that, it has been our go-to piece of gear for the first 11 months of life.  It's been our sherpa in the airport, allowing me traveling alone with the baby to easily schlep the diaper bag and carseat from one gate to the next (traveling alone with a 9 month old, I went ahead and bought the baby a seat so I could set her down sometimes.  On that note, I had no trouble at all fitting the Snugride 35 into an airplane seat.  On another note, there was 1 flight out of 4 where the flight attendant stated that, even though purchasing the seat in the first place was elective, SINCE I'd purchased it using it was now mandatory during taxi, take-off, and landing, ""even if she's screaming.""  So I would definitely NOT buy a seat for a baby under 6 months or a baby that could not be distracted for that amount of time or if you wanted to nurse during those times.  In our case, she was able to eat baby food -oh ANOTHER FYI, bring re-sealable pouches not jars when traveling and choose the thickest and therefore least drippy/messy purees you can find- during those times and was perfectly happy).Even though she's often in the Baby Bjorn (which, by the way, if you get one, definitely get one with lumbar support.  We started off with a regular one and shelved it by the time she was 3 months old whereas the Synergy is still perfectly comfortable.  And if you live somewhere at all warm, I would highly recommend white mesh over the solid black or navy fabric.  We are now looking into the Beco though because after 6 months it really is nice to be able to hip-carry or back-carry.  Besides that, you technically shouldn't forward face in the Baby Bjorn because their legs go numb.  But I digress...), so yes, even though she's often in the Baby Bjorn, we'd often bring this thing into the mall to carry our coats and hats, the diaper bag, our coffee (which is safe when the baby isn't in it), our purchases and so on.She used it as a walker wagon in the airport, killing time between connections.  Do get the Graco Snugride 35 to go with it.  I loved using the shade when she fell asleep in the car (especially when we were moving and driving at night; it blocked the headlights zooming by) and easily moving her sleeping self into the house or out to errands.  And in winter, it was nice to easily bring her seat in over night so that it wasn't icy-cold in the mornings.  Plus, with a weight limit of 35 pounds, it will help her stay rear-facing for a long time.",5
Munchkin My First Turtle Shower,"First off, the tubing was bent and the little piece actually floated so when you pushe the button, it was sucking air. It did finally straighten out but it's no fun. It's small so it's really just something for the kids to push on and see water squirt out. I was hoping there'd be some syphon action where they could push the button a couple times to get the water started; but not so. It is cute but the kids don't play with it.",2
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",My grandson already had a couple of HALO SleepSacks for winter.  This 100% cotton one is perfect for warmer weather.  My daughter doesn't have to worry about her little guy kicking off his cover.  This is a great idea!!,5
"Baby Jogger 2010 City Select Single Stroller, Onyx","We have a 2yr old and a 2 month old. I wanted a double stroller that I could switch the seats to be forward or rear-facing. The city select seemed perfect! It's not, BUT I still really like it! And don't regret spending $600+ on it. I use the 2 seats, did not get bassinet or car seat adapter.Pros:I'm 5'9"" and love how far the handle extends.Love the brake on the handleI like how easily and far back the seats recline. My 2mo old is very comfortable and safely restrained in his seat (even tho they officially say that it is recommended for infants 6mo+)Like the diamond color and it seems to clean easily. I've had to wipe up some strawberry juice and it came right off.Like the generous sun shades. Tho I must admit I have unzipped the mesh on the back (they say not to) to give it more room (to completely cover my baby when he's reclined)Great basket with zippers to expand.Customer service is great - had a rip in basket. Called them and they shipped another the next day.LOVE that I can have my kiddos facing me or turn them around. I switch them up all the time. Of course, I don't use all 20 configurations, but I switch between 3 quite often.Cons:I didn't want a tandem stroller and this one is a bit tandem-like with both seats on. But of course it would be when you're trying to fit 2 kids on 1 stroller!Difficult to push up and down dips in the sidewalk with my 30lb girl in the front. Makes my outside wrist sore. I did find a configuration that I liked with her closer to me and the baby in front.Tough to push up over curbs.  It's sturdy and I can actually pop it up just by pushing down on the handle with all my weight, but it's hard.It's heavy to get in and out of my trunk. Oh well, it's what I expected.",4
Medela Breastmilk Collection and Storage Bottles 8oz (250ml) - 2 Each,great price and great product. they do hold more than 8 oz if you need that. the ounces are raised and not printed so you don't have to worry about it rubbing off in the wash.,5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Busy Baby Booster,"We bought this chair 15 months ago, & we AND our granddaughter are STILL thrilled with it!  We have loaned it to Maddie's parents to take along for a week at the beach, or whatever, because it is more compact & easier to handle during travel than a standard booster chair, & have taken it to local restaurants when the five of us wanted to have dinner out.  It is sturdy, very easy to clean, & while Maddie's entertainment values have changed over the intervening months, she still likes having the play bar on the tray if she's waiting for a snack or meal.  This chair will work well for us for several more years (until Maddie is big enough to sit up to the table in a grown-up chair), & has proved to be EXCELLENT value for money.  This is a real winner -- & when we're finished with it we can proudly donate it to a local charity boutique for resale in their children's shop.",5
"Nuby 2 Count 2 Handle Cup with No Spill Super Spout, Colors May Vary","Daughter likes these cups. Sometimes lid can be challenging to get on. Handles very close to cup, but works for us.",4
Nuby Icybite Hard/Soft Teething Keys,My son really loved this and I like that you can refrigerate it for use as a teething ring.  Really love that it is dishwasher friendly.  Would definitely purchase again!,5

MobiCam Audio Video Baby Monitoring System,This monitor works very well.  The picture is clear and love the color and night time vision!,5
"Stork Craft Custom Tuscany Espresso Finish Glider and Ottoman with Free lower lumbar pillow, Beige Cushions","This chair is a great value! I purchased it for our nursery and it looks beautiful. It was very easy to assemble (probably took a total of 30 minutes), and is pretty light - I didn't have any trouble moving it into the nursery by myself (pregnant). It looks just as nice as chairs that cost significantly more money, and I'm definitely happy that we decided to go with this one over something more expensive. The cushions are more firm than some other options I tried, but I wanted that as I've found super soft cushions to be uncomfortable and don't suitable support my back or tailbone for more than a few minutes. I can understand previous reviewers feedback about the chair being designed for &#34;smaller&#34; women, but I think that perspective might be a little skewed. I am 5'7 and 190 lbs eight months pregnant (not exactly petite), and I fit in the chair just fine, even with a nursing pillow around my belly. I could see that this chair would probably be too small if you were very tall or very heavyweight.",5
"Tommee Tippee Explora Easi Roll Bib, Pink and Purple, 2 Count","These bibs are AWESOME. so easy to clean, and the best part is they catch all of the dropped food. We are doing BLW and instead of making of a mess of the highchair/her lap we can just grab the dropped food out of the bib and back onto her tray.But make sure you shop around. This price is double what I paid for the same 2 pack of bibs elsewhere!",5

Summer Infant Deluxe Comfort Booster- Tan,Its easy to secure it onto the chair and my 7 month old daughter loves to sit and play on it.I wish sliding in and out the tray was easier and the cut marks under the tray was smoother. The plastic scratched my daughter a bit when I pulled her out with tray extended out. I would need to cover it up with paper tape...Also on a regular height table and chair the booster seat won't slide under the table like it shows on the box. Unless you get a shorter chair. If the arm rest was detachable or bendable outdated seat would slide under the tableOverall it does it's job.,3
Nuby Monster 7oz Monster 2 Handle No-Spill Sippy Cup- 4M+,The 'arms' kept coming off the cup and eventually they were lost and the cup cracked after one fall from the high chair. It only lasted a few months.,1
"MAM Trends Silicone Pacifier, Blue, 0-6 Months, 2-Count","Love these binkies only ones I've used with my babies, easy to clean I the container, fun cute colors for baby girl.",5
"Soft Gear My Deluxe Changing Mat, Pink",I decided to go with this rather than the typical foam/cloth changing table pads and I'm so glad I did! I'm a new mother so I'm not exactly a pro at changing diapers and lets just say if this were cloth I'd be washing it daily! Luckily I can just wipe it clean quick and easy. I didn't give it 5 stars b/c my little one is still small so I cant say how it will be fit wise once she gets older but I'm sure she will fit. It also did have a slight smell when it was new but I bought it before she was born and within a few days (after a good washing) the smell was completely gone.,4
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,I love this product because I can just scoop up toys after the kids have had their baths. This product's suction cup has only separated from the tile it's attached to once in the last month. We have a lot of toys in the basket so falling off of the wall once a month seems more than reasonable.,5
"Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, Green/Blue","my son loves to sit in this, even just as a chair. easy to pack up and go, we used it in a hotel room for meals and snacks and it worked great.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","I showed my three year-old daughter photos of the different animals and she picked out the frog. She loves her backpack! Very well made, great size for a toddler. Fantastic item!",5
Happy Tails 4-Piece Crib Bedding Set,"What a great price on this bedding set!  The Lamb and Ivy brand is a well known brand and the design is so cute, and pretty gender neutral.  Our first baby girl is expected to arrive in about 2 months so we decided to order this set in case she has a little brother in the future, he can use the same bedding.  We registered this set and our friends ordered them and had them sent to us.  We got them today and they look just like the picture.  The colors are great.  We got some extra sheets at Ikea and the green totally goes with the green in this set.",5
Boutique Brand New GEENNY Boy Sailor 13PCS Baby Nursery CRIB BEDDING SET,"First of all this was a gift for my niece and I am a gift perfectionist so I do expect quality. Having said that. what I really appreciated about this particular ""nautical"" crib layette was that the colors were not your average expected nautical theme colors in strictly red, white and blue, yet at the same time you still had the intended  ""nautical"" theme clearly shine through, with lots of vibrant coloring yet done with such a classy touch with the tones of the colors and the timeless look to walk into a nursery w/out over doing it and just to note so not to mislead anyone the colors are still as vibrant and very naturally just a ""STEP UP"" if you will on colors and the placements.a boys set. I guess it could be used for a girl if you were to be looking for a boating style crib bedding but I guess for me when I think for a little girl I tend to automatically lean towards pink all the way  and not all moms to be do, So if you wanted to incorperate a nautical themed set into your little girls nursery then I also would say that this still by far would still be my selected set. I hope everyone else whom decides to purchase finds this to be as beautiful as I described~! P.S. I in adition purchased on amazon a set of 2 wooden anchors to hang and then 2 sets of the easily removeable wall stickers that pop up when viewing this set and the 2 sets I decided on purchasing were so perfect in color match. (look up my selection or email me) and to top it off I of course did buy the lamp shade and the wall hangings and mobile for that price how could you not?Good Luck~! Amy",5
Mobi MobiCam Audio Video Wireless Internet Kit,"This kit includes drivers, webcam software, and pass-through cable to connect the MobiCam monitor to your PC via USB.An additional monthly subscription fee is required if you actually want to view your MobiCam remotely via the Web.  They allow up to 2 hours viewing time per month, but with grandparents that live 7 hours away, 2 hours won't get them through a month. So, if you decide to get this, then pay the $ and allow grandparents to experience the child's life while they still can.I began to worry when I noticed one of the requirements, as listed on their box, is a ""steaming"" internet connection.  This shows a lack of attention to detail and poor quality assurance; I would have immediately put this thing back on the shelf and walked away after reading a typo like that on product packaging.  How good could it really be if this is how they're marketing themselves?  But, this was given to us as a gift; so, I tried it out.  My fears worsened after I began to read the included manual - my 9-week old son could produce a better technical document than what they put out...I was embarrassed for them.I installed the software on my desktop, and was able to get it working after some trials & tribulations with my firewall.  However, the web cam software (mpeg4decoder.exe) crashes consistently, taking Windows Explorer down with it.  I decided to try the software on my laptop to see if it worked any better on a different computer.  Upon installation, Avira AntiVir identified the webcam software as a backdoor server (BDS/Hupigon.Gen).Also, the software can only be installed on one computer.  We would like to use it on our desktop on occasion, so I can use my laptop to access the internet and view my son when I'm away on business.  We would also like to use it on the laptop downstairs, when my wife & I are both at home and viewing the MobiCam monitor downstairs, while baby sleeps upstairs.In summary:  buggy software needs to be fixed; questionable virus/backdoor distributed with their software; software should be allowed on multiple computers (e.g. iTunes); fix horrible writing & typos in your documentation and on your product packaging - show us you care about your product.",1
Summer Infant By Your Side Sleeper Portable Bedding,"Honestly, this co-sleeper is absolutely everything I could have wanted in a co-sleeper- expect that my baby girl refused to sleep in it. She wouldn't fall asleep in it so we waited until she was asleep to move her. Then, almost as if she had sensed a disturbance in the force, her eyes would pop open and she would wail until we moved her directly into bed with us. To be fair, I think she would have done this with any co-sleeper. Maybe other mamas and papas out there would have better luck with this co-sleeper. As for us? It's been sitting in our storage room with all the other expensive crap that we bought our little girl that she snubbed.",2
Waterproof Baby Bibs with Placemat for Boys &amp; Girls,"The Perfect Bib truly is the perfect bib &#8212; plus much more! Consisting of two separable pieces, the bib transforms from a small bib with a pouch to a full-length bib. The Perfect Bib has endless uses, limited only by your creativity.

"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","Unlike other brands i bought at big box store and returned, my five year old can easily buckle herself in. I could hardly get the other brand to unbuckle and release this one with ease.Love the cow print and the fact that my child can keep the same car seat for the next five years and be very safe.This seat cost more than double the others and is worth every cent!",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","This bra is amazing!!!  I've been using it for a month now and I have nothing bad to say about it.  You can tell a lot of thought went into the design of this bra.  The front zip closure makes it easy to get off and on throughout the day (I think you can tell by the picture that it's not going to be a flattering bra to wear all day, only wear it while pumping).  It takes me less than 1 minute to get all set up.  This is essential for any working mom who needs to multitask  while pumping.  I'm a 38C and I got the small.  I could be several sizes bigger or smaller and it would still adjust to fit.  Seriously buy it!  You won't be disappointed!",5
"Britax Head and Body Support Pillow, Iron/Gray","I bought this for my daughter because she a little over 6lbs and did not fit snug in her car seat. This helped out tremendously and kept her nice and snug. I don't use it anymore because my baby girl has grown a lot since then. But if you feel you need this for the same purpose I mentioned, then it will work well for you too.",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"I just bought this stroller to use while we're out of town for a wedding. I have a City Mini, which I love, but like everyone else, it's really bulky (even when folded up) and hard to carry around (we took the train to this city). I did a ton fo research on umbrella strollers b/c I didn't want to spend the same amount of money I did on our City Mini, nor want something that was flimsy and felt like it was going to break since our daughter is a big little girl. This, so far, is not only a really solid feeling umbrella stroller, but moves and handles very well. I'm pretty proud of myself for making this purchase and I have a feeling I'm going to end up using it a lot more than I think.If you're looking for storage, this isn't going to be the umbrella stroller for you, which I think defeats the purpose of an umbrella stroller anyway. It's also a little heavier than you would expect. But if you want a solid and maneuverable stroller for travel or quick trips out of the house, I think you'll really like this. I haven't yet needed to recline it, but I think it'll work great.  I'll definitely update this review if anything changes.",5
"Joovy Room&sup2; Portable Playard, Red","I just got my Purpleness Playard and my 9-month old twin girls love it!  I'm ordering another one now because I just realized that even if there is enough room for two to play, one ends up sitting on the other or taking her sister's toys.The fitted sheet is very soft and the playard is easy to assemble and pack up.  It's a bit heavy to carry around, but no problem if it's just to the car and back.When packing up the playard, make sure the lower bars are all further in than the upper bars.  It took me a few minutes to figure out why it wasn't folding properly the first time around and this was the problem.Funny, I read a review that mentioned that her mom said all old play pens were made this way.  My mom said the same exact thing when I showed her my new giant playard!",5
Towel Doll Country Mouse,"All four of my children have a Kathe Kruse towel doll. They are the best comforts ever and they are small enough to fit in your purse. I always buy two so we can wash one and still have one to use. We lost one of the Country Mouse dolls, so I need a new back-up. I would recommend any of these - just beware of the white lamb. That one will never be completely white again! Even with two.",5
"Boppy Cottony Cute 2-Sided Slipcover, Polka Stripe Green","I bought this cover so I could have a backup when my other cover got dirty.  Overall I really like it, and it serves its purpose (plus it has a cute pattern).  The only bad things I'd have to say about it is this:1. The cover is a little tight and it fits but it's hard to get on and I have to stuff the Boppy pillow into it to get it zipped shut (my other Boppy cover fits much better).2. I have two dogs with black hair and I'm constantly finding their dog hair stuck to my pillow and it's hard to get off because it really sticks to the cover for some reason.  My other cover doesn't seem to do this, just this one.",4
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack",Where should I begin? Did not help colic at all. Never hold in any position other than upright in a bottle bag or they leak. Hard to clean. Does not reduce spitup.Very sorry I wasted my money on these. They are a pain and not worth the extra money at all.,1
"Pearhead Canvas Handprint Wall Art Set, Blue","This kit is amazing.  We just made one as a birthday gift for Grandma and I plan to get another for our house.  What a beautiful way to capture memories and decorate at the same time.  I disagree with reviews that it doesn't have enough detail.  I like the simplicity of it.  By being clean and streamlined, it fits into our decor perfectly.  Also, I feel as though the basic design doesn't detract from the handprints themselves - they are the focal point.  Love it!",5
Construction Melamine Dinnerware Set,Love this dinnerware set for my 2 year old grandson - it's his favorite and I like how there are three sections to the plate plus the bowl.  He's all about trucks and loves looking for the truck hiding under his food!  Easy to clean and care for too.,5
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Swaddle Blanket 2 Pack, For The Birds","This is a great size blanket for swaddling.  I prefer the bamboo fabric, however, because they are much softer.  The blankets are thin and breath so your baby won't overheat.  This is a must have for any parent with an infant.",5
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Jumperoo,This is adorable. We bought it as a gift for our friends and they loved it. It does take up a LOT of space and doesn't fold or put away easily though.,5
Lillebaby 5 Position Everywear Baby Carrier - Organic - Earth Brown,"This was the second carrier that I purchased since my son was born. The first was the moby but i wanted a structured carrier as well, and went with the lillebaby. I soon realized my son, who is very tall for his age, was not comfortable in this carrier. He is actually average weight but it was really hard on my back carrying him as well. I kept thinking that I needed to reajust the straps which I did, but the carrier itself just wasn't wide enough for my big boy. And I'm a small mama (almost 5'3"" and 108 pounds) so I needed something with a lot more support. I got the Boba G2 and I LOVE it! And so does my LO. Even the Boba's fabric is thicker. Maybe if you have a smaller child, this carrier works, but not for us.",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"As the father of a four-month old daughter, and someone who has studied music from the age of 4, I was thrilled to play with this toy, and spent over 30 minutes playing with it myself. The sound quality isn't great -- it's true (think midi instruments from your standard cheap composition software), but the idea is fantastic. There are numerous songs, each with harp, piano, flute, french horn, and violin parts. You can listen to any combination of those parts on any song. Although it's a bit much for a four-month old, I'm sure she'll enjoy it as much (or more!) than I do.",5
Sweet Jojo Designs Musical Baby Crib Mobile - Vintage French Black Toile,"I was very disappointed with this item, especially for it costing almost $50 (with tax and shipping). It barely plays music, before it shuts off...and the music itself was not very loud. Sounds like a music box on it's last leg. We were not able to install it on the crib as the instructions stated and we had to ""rig"" it to make it stay. Not worth the money and I would not reccommend.",1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We travel frequently and often host guests. Without a guest room, having this cot allows us to give her double bed and even her room at night to grandma and other guests. This bed is compact (slides under the regular bed at home; light to carry on plane; takes up half the room folded as an umbrella stroller) and comfortable enough for our daughter to sleep in as needed. Crib/toddler bed sheets fit it perfectly. We do need to pad it a bit with a blanket under her fitted sheet. It's also great for smaller toddlers because it cradles a bit -meaning that rolling out would be near impossible. I only wish it were a little longer so that she could sleep in it as she gets older, but I am sure there are similar products out there for older kids. That said, my kid is 4 and 90th percentile, and I think she's got a good 6+months of use left with it.",5
Bearington Baby Posh Dots Crib Blanket (Blue),"Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous. So soft, beautiful colors, washes nicely and doesn't shed. I couldn't say more good about it.",5
"Britax Kick Mats (2-Pack, Black)",Work great fit nice and tight.  Keeps the back seats nice and clean.  Prevents the leather from being tore up from the kids boots,5
Graco 1 Second Ear Thermometer,I rated this a three only b/c I think it reads lower than what the baby's temp actually is. It is nice that it reads so fast vs the typical thermometer that you use on a baby and try to keep them still for that long...IMPOSSIBLE.,3
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,"These blankets are the best and I only wish I'd had some for my first little one!  They are so soft, generously sized (which makes swaddling so much easier, if you choose to do that), and wash well (stains come out easily and no pilling or wash wear).  We've had ours for over a year now and have no complaints.  I was hesitant about the price but we use them every single day and hardly use any other blankets, although we throw a fleece on top of it now that it's cold out and the baby's sleeping in a larger crib.  My youngest spent her first 8 months sleeping by me in a rocknplay and I would fold this, lay it on top of her (and the restraint) and tuck it in around her (not over her arms).  She never got too hot or cold. They also work well for a nursing cover and you don't feel like you're in a sauna!  I had a set of 4 from Target, too, but they are not the same blanket.  These are so much better...softer and bigger!  One tip...if your diaper bag has Velcro at the opening be careful putting the blanket in and taking it out so it doesn't snag.  If you don't actually need to Velcro your bag shut you can get an extra piece to cover the rough half and not worry about this.",5
babyletto Modo 3 Drawer Dresser Changer in Espresso/White,"I know it's tempting - it has a nice modern design, and it's hundreds cheaper than the designer ones you've been admiring. Here's the thing, though - it's complete effing garbage. As many other reviewers have pointed out, it's made almost completely out of particle board. (I have two other pieces of furniture in my nursery from IKEA, and I consider both to be of much better quality than this.) The drawers make a wretched scraping sound when you open them, and the top one is visibly crooked - with seemingly no possible adjustments to correct the problem. Yeah, to most onlookers, it looks nice from across the room. Unfortunately, when *you* look at it from across the room, you'll probably just feel really disgusted about what you spent on it.",1
"Kushies Flushable Biodegradable Diaper Liners, 100 Sheets","These liners are ok - they do the job, but they're pretty big (on our 11 month old) and fairly stiff. I found I could wash the wet ones once (sometimes twice) and hang to dry; they get softer and thinner, but still work again. I like the Bummies liners much better, and I'm using those from now on.",2
Philips AVENT 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer,Very easy to leave saturated for hours/days at a time. If you're wife is able to breast feed consistently it's easy to forget the back up. Over saturated bottles left for 10 hours can't be any more sanitary than washed and properly stored bottles+ .. everything else.,3
Britax B-Nimble Mosquito Net,"Perfect for Macclaren stroler. Others I have seen are  very bulky, this one is very nice looking. Easy to install.",5
"Lamaze Cloth Book, Panda's Pals",My child is under 6 months but still loves this book. He smiles while turning the pages. Giving this item 3 out of 5 starts because one of the pick-a-boo flaps was sewn to the binding and we can not view the bears that would be hiding under the log. Other than that its baby approved.,3
"The Safe Sporter Water Bottle, Blue, 16 Ounce",This is a great water bottle for kids and doesn't leak! Perfect for 3-8 year olds. A sturdy and strong bottle.,5
"Safety 1st LED Nightlight, 2 Count","I love these nightlights.  They provide enough light without blinding you at night, and the light sensor for when to come on is good.",5
Under The Nile Strawberry Toy,My grandson loves these.  They are easy to grip and hold.  I don't worry if he puts it in his mouth knowing that they are made from organic material.  He also is learning what veggies and fruits are!!,5
"Kidz Delight Silly Sam the Broom and Dustpan with Larry the Talking Vacuum, Green",A must have for your little one who loves to sweep and vacuum like you do. My little one loves this and helps me a lot,5
Safety 1st Bath Toy Bag,Holds up very well.  Haven't had it drop like my previous toy holder (the frog).  But I do need to say that it gets stinky after a short while.  It starts smelling like a damp towel... you have to take it down and wash it.  I sprayed it with oxiclean and put it in the washer --- then I tumble dried it.,4
Mother-Ease Bedwetter Training Pants (Medium (55-65 lbs)),"Ordered for my 3 1/2 year old son. He stays dry in the daytime but soaks overnight diapers several times week. His sheets could no longer handle the daily washings so I put out the $30 hoping for a miracle.The pro's: highly absorbent (think swamp butt) and could double as a jock strap/cup as he repeatedly hit himself in the groin and buttocks...cause he could.The con's: very large...like reverse mushroom large. Comically large. Sort of like clown underpants. But he liked that part so maybe that's a pro(?). Secondly they were peed in within an hour and they must have been VERY absorbent that he didn't say anything! He was fine sitting in them which could mean they are no good as a trainer, or i'd better start buying new sheets!",3
Sesame Street Elmo Adventure Potty Chair,"My Granddaughter loves Elmo so this was a hit, likes to flush it, can remove the yellow part, not a big issue. Wish me luck with her training.",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units,"Units were flawless...until we unplugged the monitor piece to move it in the room. After that, they would never sync and both monitors always said ""NOT LINKED"". Nothing I tried got them to work. Contacted VTECH and they sent out a new unit. That worked great (a few months) until tonight, my wife unplugged the monitor as we reorganized our daughter's room. Big Mistake. ""NOT LINKED"" again, both units. HELLO, VTECH? What is the problem? Why do you keep manufacturing and selling junk? I would NOT recommend buying this item because eventually, it will fail and there is no way to fix it. Stick to another brand.2/11/14 Update: I just received the second replacement set and they're working properly (they should). Props to VTECH for replacing mine a second time. I really like them when they work, but just worry the next time they die, they won't be replaced. Something like baby monitors should last at least 4-5 years in my opinion, especially the very light use we give them: All 3 pieces stay where they are and are never moved (until we rearrange a room and unplug them to use a different outlet).",2
One Step Ahead Secure Transitions Inflatable Baby Tub,"Unfortunately, my son loves this tub.  I say ""unfortunately"" since we are now on our 4th one.  I love the fact that it is large enough to accommodate a 30 lb, 33"" toddler and an ample supply of toys.  The tub, however, seems to have a life span of a few months before springing a leak.  The holes usually occur on the seams and the included patch does not seem to hold well.  I've even tried a heavier-duty patch kit with no luck.  I don't think my son is overly hard on the tub, these leaks just seem to happen with normal use.  If it was sturdier, it would be perfect!  I haven't experienced any issues with the bottom being slippery and I really like the thick sides.  My son will even lean back and rest his head on the side to have his hair rinsed.  I've tried other tubs, both hard plastic and inflatable, but my son refused to even get in them - and for now, peaceful bathtime = happy mom!",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"I bought this after reading the great reviews online. When I received it, it was very easy to put together (well, I watched while my hubby did it - but it looked like it was super easy). Trying it out, it was just low enough for my 4 month old munchkin to reach with her tippy-toes but she hated it at first. After introducing it several times, it started to grow on her and she began playing.A good thing about this jumper is that it has the bright colors and a variety of things for your baby to look at. However, there is 3 of the same item: spinning things that make noise. After playing with one for a while, my baby isn't so interested in playing with the other 2 even if I spin them to get her attention. Additionally, some of the items just hang and are pretty much stuck to the jumper - meaning if your baby is developing, she/he will more than likely want to touch and taste everything but can't do this. With even one animal facing away from her, she gets really upset trying to pull each one toward her without success.There is actually only 1 item on this thing that your baby will be able to pull on and bring to her/his mouth. Although it has soft wings, the body is a hard plastic, so whenever your baby pulls it spastically (which most young enough will have the classic flailing arms)it either clinks against the jumper's side or smacks your baby in the face - which has happened many times with my baby (It's only funny until she starts crying). The good thing about this item is that it can be removed and washed (and so can the seat cover, thank goodness).SUMMARY: Bright and colorful, my baby happily does her little ""plies"" on this thing. However, I don't really think it was worth the money we paid (especially since it's much cheaper now - boooooo!), considering the unexciting attachments. I think you can find something close to this and your baby would love it just as much.",2
"Summer Infant Fox &amp; Friends Classic Comfort Wood Bassinet, Espresso Stain","I ordered this in January for my grand baby . When it was put together, it was missing the bottom basket storage. My daughter has tried calling the company over and over and no one will return her calls.she has sent emails with no answer. This is very upsetting. She does love the bassinet. Just wish we could get all the parts.",2
Lamaze Indigo Stroller - Grey/Black,I am so excited about this stroller have wanted this for so long had the peg perego p3 for several months but not what I wanted. So happy and cant wait to use this tommorow. With my 11.5 month old.,5
"Prince Lionheart Seat Neat, Black/Grey",Fits and covers my chairs under my boys boosters.  Wipes clean easily very happy with the purchase it's definitely protecting my chairs!,5
Shark SwimFin Blue,"Best customer service! Did not have any problems once so ever . Aleays kept me updated on my shipments status. And what's best about purchasing swimfins from """"swim with coach X"""" is that he has different variety of colors ! This is a great product I use it to help kids and adults to swim .",5
"Bumkins Disney Baby Waterproof Super Bib, Princess, 6-24 Months, 2 Count","We use these bibs everyday on our daughter.  We clean them with the dishes and just hang them to dry.  We throw them in the wash every weekend and are safe to put in the dryer as well.  Since they are a thin plastic material, they keep all the wet and messy stuff off our daughter's clothes.  The designs are cute too!",5
"The Peanut Shell Baby Sling, Quincy, Small","It is harder to use then I thought. It took several attempts but once I finally got my daughter inside she started crying. I tried it a few other times and she cries every time. She is 7 weeks old now and I'm hoping she will like some of the other carrying positions when she gets bigger. I do really like the pattern and feel of the fabric, however its a little bit big on me. I got a small and I'm 119lbs and 5'3. I would recommend this to someone who already knows their baby will like it but keep in mind its not as easy to use as it looks.",4
"Bumkins Waterproof Splat Mat, On The Go","This mat is perfect as it's very easy to clean and doesn't attract static electricity or food to itself. But I wish the manufacturer made them twice this size as a toddler sitting on a highchair would surely try their best throwing power and I always have to clean up around this mat instead of inside of it. Very good concept, but doesn't work well for my son!",4
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"Just returned this to amazon.  If you're going to buy this make sure that you don't have any other 900Mhz wireless technologies around, or it won't work, as I found out the hard way.Otherwise it has a decent picture and sound. Camera is very light due to the plastic construction.  I'm going to buy the interference free kind.  Hope this helps.",3
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"We have a couple of gates that are made similar to this one (metal, walk through).  We bought this one for the bottom of our stairs.  The opening is 30"" and no matter how we positioned it would not fit.  Luckily we have a one step landing and another opening before the actual flight of stairs which is the same width as the stairs (I'd say around 31-32"") and it does fit there.  It's not the ideal place as I'd really like to keep our baby off the landing as well, but it serves the most important purpose which is keeping him from going up all the stairs.The door to the gate is a little trickier than the other two that we have.  It just doesn't quite seem to line up properly, and we've readjusted the position of the gate, etc.I do like the extender kit that comes with it incase we ever want to use it on another door.  It seems sturdy and good enough for the price.",4
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"Seriously, I LOVE my stroller frame. It is small enough to take anywhere and fit in almost any vehicle. It;s easy to open and close and very lightweight but durable. My son was BIG and heavy. 14 pounds at 2 months old. This stroller was awesome, sturdy and reliable. The large basket underneath was great. I even put groceries in it when I had to get just a few things at the store. This stroller is best used for quick trips in the grocery store where u don't need a basket, the mall, office, outdoor fairs, parades, museums, walks on sidewalks or smooth roads. That's what I used it for and it was a Godsend! I don't recommend it for beaches, rocky trails, rough roads, or grass. Only fits with the 2-3 carseats they list. I unfortuantely bought the snugride 32. The carseat itself was great, but my son surpassed the weigh limit by 5 months old, although most babies prolly won't. I would recommend to all mothers to by the infant carseat with the 30 pound weight limit, not the 22 pound one. Good luck and enjoy your time with your baby while their still a baby! I sure did.",5
"Maxi Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat, Sweet Cerise","What more could you ask for. Its so easy to take my daughter in and out of this car seat. It doesn't get super hot in the sun, and isn't freezing in the winter. It is the very best all around. I would recommend this to everyone with a baby.",5
"3 Sprouts Storage Bin, Monkey","Nice big tote, stands on its own.  Packed flat, wrinkles may last for a while due to the thick canvas.  Exactly as in pictures, ribbon a tiny bit brighter in person.  Surprisingly large, will hold a large playground ball, Bumpo, Boppy, and other big items no problem.",5
"Bebe Dubon Fresh Fruit Feeder, 6 Months, Colors May Vary","These are so messy!  I like the idea of my baby eating on her own, but to me it's not worth the cleanup. Not only does she get the food, especially banana, all over herself through the mesh, but that mesh is extremely difficult to clean and needs to be replaced often.  I used mine once or twice and never again!",2
Pop-Up Mosquito-Net Crib,It's a good product for the price. It's not for long term use maybe for a vacation or two and it's over,4
"The First Years 1 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce","I loved these bottles. After starting to lose my sanity breastfeeding my baby seemingly around the clock (leaving very little time for my plans of world domination, let alone eating and combing my hair occasionally), we found these bottles. They are wonderfully compatible with breastfeeding! The two nipple design means baby really has to suck to get milk out, which helps when you want to avoid nipple confusion. My newborn was always a bit fussier at the breast after drinking from faster-flowing bottles, but once we got these bottles he was fine. He latched on perfectly well after using these bottles, no confusion at all. Since they worked so well, I started pumping to make a couple of bottles, and my husband was able to take a night time feeding shift, which was fantastic! Not only did these bottles allow me to get a little more sleep (alleluia!), they gave my husband that nice feeding bond with baby. 10 enthusiastic thumbs up (and never you mind why I have 10 thumbs).",5
"Pinzon Baby By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Wild Thing",These are my absolute favorite blankets- even softer than the other aden & anais blankets I purchased on Amazon. I just wish they had more patterns available.,5
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"This is one of my most favorite baby products.  My son loves it too.  He went through the separation axiety phase a little early and when I wasn't able to put him down, my arms would feel like they were going to fall off.  With the carrier I am able to do the dishes and the laundry and keep him happy all at the same time.  He loves to dance with mommy, too, so I just put him in the carrier and dance with him that way.  When he was younger, sometimes that would be the only way that I could put him to sleep.  Also, I always seem to be cold, so having him in the carrier, right next to my chest, was a really inexpensive way to keep warm.  Oh, and when we go out shopping we can carry him around in the carrier instead of having to lug a big stroller everywhere.  If there were more stars I would definitely give more.  I also love the fact that it's machine washable and it's easy to use.  It doesn't take you 30 minutes just to put it on.",5
Dorel Juvenile Cabinet Lock (Set of 2),"THESE LOCKS ARE AWFUL.  I'm so glad that I'm not the only one who thinks so because these are so hard to use.  I had to struggle to get them open to begin with, and it took like almost 10 minutes to wrestle it off of my cabinet after I put it on. Such a waste of money.",1
"Dappi Waterproof 100% Nylon Diaper Pants, 2 Pack, White, Small","We are potty training my son and I ordered the size according to his weight. They are HUGE! They contain accidents somewhat but they leak a lot since they are so big. Since I ordered 6 of these, I will be keeping them. Maybe they work better if you order a smaller size.",2
"BabyHawk Mei Tai Baby Carrier, Black/Lime Motifs","I used this to cook dinner, do yardwork, laundry, grocery shopping. Totally worth the money because it makes my life and his much more pleasant.",5
Nuk Replacement Spouts - 2 Pack Soft Silicone Clear,It is good to find replacements for the cups that are still good.  Happy to have found these replacement spouts online.,5
Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball,"We have had this for a month and my 7 month old plays with it every other day. She is fascinated by all the moving parts and really enjoys playing with the ball at the top. She will hold it and shake it and turn the frog in the middle for AAAGGEES. Great pruchase, highly recommend!",5
Sesame Street Fire Department 4 Piece Set,"Set looks nice, however it gets only 2 stars from me since it is 100 polyester. Web site description specify 55% cotton and 45% polyester.If you don't care, I would say go for it as set looks nice. But for my Elmo fan this would be too warm and he will not be able to sleep in without sweating.. so this goes back.Amazon gets a thumb down on this one.. very disappointed. Btw, it is the second time this happened.. Had the same problem when purchased ""Sesame Street Construction Zone 4 Piece Toddler Set"" and again received a 100% polyester product, despite the description.",2
"Bright Starts Start Your Senses Safari Activity Gym, Spots and Stripes","We purchased this for our 9 week old daughter.  She LOVES it! Other toys we have introduced her to have kept her attention for a couple of minutes at most, but this activity gym holds her attention for up to 30 minutes.  She starts smiling and giggling as soon as we put her on it.  She especially loves the tiger that lights up and plays music, but she also really enjoys batting at the chime and rattle.  My husband and I have almost as much fun watching our daughter enjoy this toy as she does playing with it.  I would definitely recommend this to others!",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I love this chair. It's so portable, light, easy to use and convienent. I love that the straps hold everything together for transport plus a shoulder strap to keep your hands free. The adjustable height is great for resturants too. I will definatly be getting another for my 6 month old soon. My toddler likes the fact that I can put it in the living room floor and he can color and watch TV at the same time and I dont have to worry about him coloring on furniture.",5
"Britax Roundabout 55 Convertible Car Seat, Isabella","Comparing this to a Graco car seat, this one is much easier to get our 16 month old into and out of.",5

Saria bidet spray converts toilet into a bidet [Misc.],It was easy to install and it works very nice not too much pressure. I like it a lot.,5
"Cosco - Scenera 5-Point Convertible Car Seat, Renaissance","We bought this because it had good reviews and it was cheap. If I could go back in time, I'd just spend more money for a nicer one.My biggest complaint is the cheap fabric. It has no padding, and so it looks really uncomfortable for my little one, especially now that we've had it for a long time. The fabric is falling apart, and is actually discolored from sun damage. Granted, our car is in the sun most of the time. But even if that wasn't true, this fabric would fall apart pretty fast.Now, I'm in the market for a car seat with a 5-point harness that can switch to a booster since my little girl will be big enough for a booster within six months or so. I'm also going to look for a seat that will hold her head better when she falls asleep.I've had to travel with it, and taken it on an airplane. The airplane buckles are so bulky and stop right in the middle of her back. With the non-existant padding, it really bothered her. So frustrating. I learned to bring a blanket as a cushion, and loosened the straps for her. (I figure, if we get in an airplane accident, we'll probably all die anyway. What good comes from being uncomfortable too.) This wasn't a problem in the car.",1
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"I only purchased a second-year calendar for my son because I had one for my daughter. I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for second-year calendars in general, so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones. It's an okay calendar. The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens. The stickers aren't very cute and the pages are pretty old-fashioned looking. Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers.",2
"Brica Car Seat Grabber, Black",It keeps the back part of the seat clean. Wish it was long enough in the front that it would go over the seat. My son steps up to his chair and it doesn't fully cover the seat for my car.,3
Star Light Snoopy Fabric - By The Yard,"The fabric on the Amazon Website was listed as ""Star Light Snoopy Fabric""  i.e. Baby Snoopy. What I received was the ""Snoopy Argyle"" Fabric pattern instead.  The fabric that was shipped definitely was NOT what was pictured on the Amazon Website.  Although the Snoopy Argyle Fabric was nice, it was NOT what I ordered so I was a little surprise that a substitution was made without notifying me.  That's the reason for the low rating.",2
"Safety 1st Designer Infant Car Seat Base, Black",Fits my Eddie Bauer infant carrier perfectly. Makes switching between vehicles much easier.  I would recommend to those debating whether it is worth it to purchase an additional base to do so. Much easier!,5
Safety 1st Clear Tip Nasal Aspirator,I love being able to open this up and clean it easy. It always made me nervous with the bulbs you could not see in if it was really getting clean. I don't have to worry with these :D,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Only reason it's no 5 stars is because it doesn't &#34;lock&#34; in place when folded out for sleeping. I worry that my 2 year old isn't enough weight to keep it from trying to fold up again. But it's a great size, wonderful construction and the carrying case is fabulous! After first use, my daughter ended up on the floor (she may have crawled off herself), but it wasn't too far of a drop to wake her up. Takes up same floor space as a standard crib mattress, so make sure you've got room where you're going to put it. Perfect for light use and traveling!",4
"Britax Pavilion 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Biscotti",We have used this car seat for about 1 year.  Today the top part of the plastic chest Hug system snapped right off the strap. I will have to cut off the bottom part because otherwise the jagged piece on top is flapping and twisting near my child's chin!!  We have 21 month old twin boys that are in the 20% percentile for their weight.  It has always been a challenge to loosen and tighten the straps.  I have to pull so hard.  We have the Diono car seats in our other vehicle and would highly recommend them for ease of use and durability.,1
"Graco Backless TurboBooster Seat, Galaxy","Very easy to set, great price and have two water or drinks cup holders. The color (lucky me) is almost the same color as my car upholstery  so it matches nicely. Higly recommend.",5
"Real Nappies Potty Training Pants, White, Medium, for toddlers 30-40 lb","My son is 2 years and 11 months, 32 pounds, and 36.5 inches tall. I got size medium (30-40 lbs.) These were so tight in the legs I couldn't even pull them up. I have no idea how well work since I couldn't even get them on my son.I would not recommend these training pants.",1
P's &amp; Q's Chewy Tube Orange,My daughter was delayed in chewing effectively and this was recommended to me. She is doing great now and still loves to chew on them because she is teething. The Q is great because doesn't seem dangerous for her to walk with in her mouth. She loves the P too but I only like her using that sitting down.,5
Tadpoles Three Bulb Chandelier in Black Onyx,"Just what we were looking for to add to my daughter's newly decorated room. Price was great, shipping was super-fast and item is very cute.  Only bad thing was that one of the dangles had broken off or come de-tached.  I was able to fix this with some super glue and needle-nose pliers in about 15 minutes but it was a bit annoying.  This is why I only gave 4 stars.",4
Munchkin Dora The Explorer Toddler Dining Set,"Again, my grandson is 9 months old and I am having an Elmo theme party for his birthday. What's better than eating  from your own Elmo dining set on his1st birthday.",5
"Kids Line Luxury Blanket, Pink",This is a wonderful blanket thick and soft well made excellent material! Will buy more for baby shower! I love it and the baby use it everyday!,5
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","my kid likes a warm and and snuggle place to change her, so tried to change her on just the plastic and it was to cooled for her so i bought this cover! it easy on easy off and easy to wash !",5
BEABA First Stage Spoon Multi-Pack - Multicolor - 4 pk,"I absolutely LOVE these spoons. They are made with silicons. They are soft and safe for your baby's feeding items. The spoons are in solid one piece and you will not have any problem washing them like you do with two pieced spoons (like the one with metal spoon with silicon cover on the bowl part). There are no gap for the foods to get stuck! so, it is very sanitary :) The weight is not light but not heavy. It is more on the heavy side but that is great because you dont have any problem finding on the bottom of the dishwasher when you wash. (like, when you try to wash a plastic spoon, they fly inside of the dishwasher and you find it on the bottom :( anyways, this spoon is soft and very gentle when you scoop up some foods off from baby's face. I absolutely love it and I dont have any complain about it. It is expensive but it worth the money!",5
Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump,"My wife has been complaining that pumping has somewhat become painful because the flanges leave a mark after a 45-minute session.  This set, however, eased some of that pain because it comes with a soft silicone shield.  She prefers this over the Medela manual pump.",5
Samsung SEW-3036WN Wireless Video Baby Monitor IR Night Vision Zoom 3.5 inch,"This product are better than expected. Great image, great sound! The coast is little high but the quality of product value!",5
"Munchkin Two Snack Catchers, Colors May Vary",The only thing I don't like about these cups are their size...my toddler can eat everything in it in like a minute then is screaming for more.and the rubber flaps that prevent messes on the top tend to bend and open up more after being in the dishwasher (top rack) a few washes. but we are still using the 2 we bought and I am actually online to buy 2 more :)I was thinking about getting that Munchie Mug but i think I will let his nani and pop pop shell out the [...] bucks for me to try it :p Til then it's these handy dandy things!,4
Set of 2 Car Side Window Sun Shade Visors,"The plastic suction cups are too small for the sliver rings on the shade itself. The shade falls off leaving the suction cup on the window. Also, one of the rings ripped and now I have one useless shade. Poor Design.",2

"Tommee Tippee Explora Easi Roll Bib, Pink and Purple, 2 Count","I purchased this bib set from a local store and, although I have never bought any other Tommee Tippee brand items, I decided to give these a try.  I have a clip-on booster seat for my daughter so there is no tray like with tradition high chairs.  Food constantly fell between picking it up off the table and getting it in her mouth.  I had a few of the thinner pocket style bibs, but the pockets do not stay open, so they are kind of pointless.  These bibs catch just about everything that falls!!  They are the perfect design to not be too bulky and stay in place where you need the pocket to be.Easy on/off with little buttons built in on the back of the neck, I have not had an issue with the rubber material bothering her neck or chatching her hair.Easy clean...I just wipe with soap and water and hang to dry.  It says dishwasher safe, but I have never tried that. I have not had a problem with stains and my daughter eats a variety of colors...blueberries, spinach, pumpkin...no problem!Easy to pack away/take with you....just rolls up into it's own pocket and slips into your diaper bag.  Roll the mess up if need be and it will stay contained until you get home to clean it.Other bonus feature....my teething daughter loves to chew on the edges of the bib while waiting and it seems to be the perfect feeling for her gums!!Only downfall....the neck opening (even on the smallest hole) can be too big on my little baby for some messy foods.  If she is feeding herself something messy it tends to get on the top of her shirt at the neck, so I started putting a small cloth bib on first, then this bib to catch the dropping food.  Not a big deal, and she will obviously be able to grow into this bib for quite a while with all the additional button holes.",5
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet, Celery","Fits good, is soft, and stays on well.  Not much more one can say about such a small product.  Quality seems OK.",5
"Philips AVENT ISIS Manual Breast Pump, White","The Avent Isis breast pump works really well, if it fits you. Breasts come in many different sizes, and as few as 10% of women fit this size, approximately 25mm, well enough to get adequate milk transfer. Also, the silicone insert (for let-down stimulation) on the flange may cause irritation and pulling on the breast, as well as reduces the size of the breast flange further.The best option is to get a pump where you can change the flange custom fit to your breasts, which could mean a different size for each breast. The Medela Harmony hand pump allows you to do this, with many sizes of replacement breast flanges available, and is similarly priced.",4
Baby Trend Sit N Stand Double Stroller - Millennium,Over all it's a great stroller for a decent price. Only complaint is that it's a little difficult to fold down.,4
Sassy Ring O' Links Rattle Developmental Toy,"This is the weirdest thing, but for some reason this turned out to be the BEST toy! I can make a chain to string across his seat, turn it back into a rattle, use a few links to put other dangling toys into reach... At 3.5 months he grabbed it, then started to chew it, and now at 5 months he can pull the links off for a great gnaw. Clear, bright colors and interesting textures make this even more attractive. We flew to Australia and back... and this toy kept him well-entertained. I really didn't need to waste diaper bag space with any other toys for the trip!",5
Eshop 12 Pcs 2 1/4'' Ickel Plated Blanket Pins + Eshop Cable Tie,"A traveling nurse at my hospital told me about these things for attaching things like bandage scissors, hemostats, tape, etc to your scrubs.  As all nurses know, pocket space is limited and bulky items like these don't fit, yet you need to have them on you when you need them and not have to go hunting for them.  I am an OR nurse and I wear hospital issued scrubs and i will say that these leave a little hole wherever they are inserted and since I don't wash my own scrubs or ever see any given pair again I can't say if this hole disappears after they are washed or not, so you may use caution the first time you use them on your own scrubs.  Since they came in a pack of 6 I have backups and i will probably find tons of other uses for them around the house.  Several other nurses asked me about them when they saw mine and said that they used to use them but hadn't been able to find them in years.  I even ordered a second pack for some of them...so glad that Amazon had these!",5
Billy Bob Teeth/two Front Teeth/pacifier,ALL MY FRIENDS WITH CHILDREN WANTED THESE AFTER I BOUGHT THESE FOR ONE FRIEND! Hilarious. Definitely worth the cost! For sure!,5
"SwaddleDesigns Terry Velour Hooded Towel, Brown Mod Circles, Pastel Pink","good quality, sturdy, washes well, but definitely not plush, thick or soft, which is what I was hoping for. Very thin. But it does look exactly as pictured, so as long as you're aware of these other aspects, you won't be disappointed.",3
Cloud b Baby Sheep with Quiet Rattle,"A sad looking, dull sounding rattle.The colors are not bright and the rattle requires a vigorous shaking to be able to hear it.",1
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium","Our little boy is such a wiggler even the nurses at the hospital couldn't keep him swaddled.  We were holding his arms and legs still to get him back to sleep in the middle of the night until we bought this.  Now he sleeps from 11-6 just about every day!  We bought the large for him and it works very well, he is 3 months old, 13 pounds.",5
Baby Elephant Ears Head Support Pillow (Black Dot),"This was a good find. The only thing I wish it had was someway of connecting onto the car seat so it didn't move around. It's very plush and cozy. It fit well behind my daughters head and she seemed to like it. It should make long trips a little better when sleepy time rolls around. So far, So good!",4
"Lifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Sky/Spring Green","These teething rings are a God-sent. I purchased the pack of 2 in Pink/Lilac. They are in a pretty pastel-colour.My baby has had no problems grabbing them and using them since she was about 4 months. They are very flexible and in a safe material, easy to wash and convenient to bring along on our trips.I'm thinking of even getting another pack of 2 in other colours! So glad I made this purchase, no regrets at all.",5
"Kushies Washable Nursing Pads, White","These pads are my least favorite of the three kinds I have. They crumple after washing, show through clothes, and are not very absorbant. Since I paid for them, I use them at night. Go for something made out of jersey knit instead.",1
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"It took about an hour for me to install this - mostly because I was trying to keep my son from eating the screws. If he wasn't there, it would probably be about a 20 minute install. My only 'complaint' is that I had to use other screws than what it came with. This isn't really a 'complaint' for me, but I figured it could be for other people. Very satisfied with the durability and strength of this product. I am feeling much better about our dressers now.",4
"Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Organic Cotton Wipes,  (Pack of 2)","We love these!  We have a supply to use as wipes and a supply to use as washcloths.  Very soft and they wash very nicely.Update 12/10/11:  They still hold their shape after being washed three times a week for almost one year.  They are not nearly as soft as they once were.  That is unfortunate, but expected after so much use.  We use them wet, so it is not a problem for us.  I still recommend these reusable wipes for anyone that is cloth diapering.",5
"My Little Seat Infant Seats, Blue Fish",Bought this infant seat for a hand-me-down Chicco high chair that arrived without the straps. It fits great and keeps my grandson safe while in the high chair.  We look forward to using it at restaurants and when visiting family and friends that do not have high chairs.,5
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","I have a 1 year old and a 2 year old who constantly were getting into everything no matter how much we baby-proofed... I set this up  differently than the pictures shows... I made a long rectangle and a smaller square portion to prevent tipping. It is great. I bought some of the bright color padding on amazon and the kids actually get excited to go into the play yard! Love the ivory color as it looks nice in the living room. I bought the 8 panel play yard. More than happy with this purchase! Both of my children have plenty of room to play and now I do not have to chase my kids around 24/7. Definitely worth the investment, it has really made life easier!",5
Planetwise Flannel Wipes,"These flannel wipes are OK, but in my opinion not worth keeping.  I also ordered someImse Vimse Cloth Wipes-Ocean Blue-12 countwhich are larger, had a nicer, softer texture and just seemed higher quality.  I use cloth wipes for hands and faces and have been usingThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boyfor about 8 months now and need to replace them because they are starting to get rough and have had stink issues for a while that stripping no longer handles.",3
Pediatrician Designed Infant (Newborn Baby) and Toddler Healthcare and Grooming Kit,"I love this product! It is a great help for being a first time mom.  I remember once I called my doctor because I thought my baby's tummy was expanding, I was able to use the tape measurer in the kit and tell him how big her tummy was and re measure to compare and give the doctor more accurate results... also gave a few kits to my friends for their baby showers.. it was a hit:)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I selected the Diaper ""Champ"" mainly because you can use ordinary trash bags and not be roped into buying the specialty refill bags, and it was moderately priced (a little less than the Diaper Dekor). It also seemed that the reviews of this product were generally more positive...The positives are:1. You can use any trash bag2. Easy to use and refillThe negatives are:1. The bag doesn't seal around the dirty diapers, so when it comes time to refill the bag, it's just like opening a regular trash can. Smells like the Champ is trying to knock YOU out with odor!2. The plastic seems to smell, ie. You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ. That ""side"" of the plastic dumper-thingie is in contact with the air inside the dirty diaper changer, so when you flip it over the next time to dispose of another diaper, you smell the last 8 diapers you put in there...pretty gross.3. The ""odor seal"" (some soft material) really seems to retain odor. It cannot be washed or replaced, so after a while, the Diaper ""Champ"" smells even when freshly washed and deodorized (I'm talking about hosing down outside and scrubbing with Clorox cleanser!). Super-frustrating! This is my primary complaint.Okay, so some things are a given as far as disposal systems go (ie. *some* odor, must empty frequently, must wash and disinfect occasionally), but still I think this product leaves much to be desired.We're going to try another disposal system.",1
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count",These breast pads work great. The size and thickness was exactly what I needed. I would recommend these pads. I would definitely purchase them again.,5
The First Years Car Rear Sunshade,"This sun shade really helps. Our son cries when the sun is in his face too much in the car, so having the screen up makes the car experience much more pleasant for all of us. The screen doesn't cover the entire rear window though (thus 4 stars). It's pretty easy to see through for visibility.",4
"Tiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friends","This was the first mobile our son cooed and smiled at. He really loves it. He doesn't always love the music, so that's hit or miss. But all in all, I highly recommend. The portability is also really nice.",5
Lightweight Double Umbrella Stroller By Lmntree - Grey (Brown),"quick delivery, great brand that has lasted me several Disney trips!  I couldn't be happier wit the ease of putting together.  It takes up no space. So easy to maneuver through stores and seats my 3 year old and 1 year old cozily.",5
Teething Toys - BPA Free - Baby Q Ribs Appeteether,This teether was practical in size & texture my baby doesn't like the water filled teething rings. Plus it looks hilarious to see her chewing like a caveman on a rib.,4
Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"when he was 2 months old he keeped kicking so we figured to put him in his jumperoo. He loves it because he is able to """"stand"""" on his own and he goes crazy with it. Hes only 4 months old now but he hasnt gotten tired of it yet. I believe its a good investment.",5
Built NY Tidy Bib Black/Leaf Green,"this product is great for my teething liitle 8 month old,water proof,little pocket to catch crumbs,Its great,very happy with my order!!!!",5
"PRIMO Folding Potty with Handles, White granite","The fit on the seat isn't intuitive, but other reviewers who described how to seat the front lip in front of the potty were very helpful.My son is 30 lbs., and the seat does bow in a little from his weight, but doesn't collapse entirely. For a boy, one should keep repeating, ""Point it down, point it down,"" because there is no splash guard for absent minded boy toddlers.I can see how a little tush might get pinched if the seat were not completely unfolded before he sat down, so it's important to make sure it's completely flat.The design of going over the front of the seat makes sense now, as it minimizes contact between those curious little hands and a dirty public toilet seat. I keep Lysol wipes in my pouch to clean the bottom side of the seat before folding it up and storing it again.It fits easily into a small diaper bag or a large purse. It's definitely something I want on hand on trips to friends' houses or public places.I wish it were a little sturdier and there were a good way to avoid the possibility of pinching, but I will say my 2 year old is particularly squirmy, and he hasn't fallen in or yelped in pain yet.The bottom line is, it is functional, although not perfect, and I would buy it again if I needed to replace it.",3
"Infantino Breathe Vented Carrier, Grey","I like this item but I just hope it works, I haven't tried it with the baby yet but it looks strong & durable.",4
"Ju-Ju-Be Packabe Diaper Bag, Brown/Champagne","Love my packabe! Others have complained about there not being a handle for carrying. I have fixed that problem and attached tiny zip ties (there are 2 hardware pieces that meet at the top) that keep the straps as a backpack and also forms a handle...works perfectly! & if you want the long handle, just snip the zip ties. Simple...perfect size and holds sippy cups great. This is a great bag for when you have 2 children and  you need to be hands free. Very durable fabric and liner and overall a great design.",5
New Native Baby Carrier: Black Small (chest size 30-33&quot;),"I agree with the two previous reviews, the small infant is engulfed in fabric and it doesn't seem safe.  A larger child doesn't seem to fit.  Also, everytime we squeezed my newborn into the carrier, he had a diaper blow out, probably due to the strange angle he was arranged in.  And, the merchant that sells this product for Amazon doesn't accept returns.  Buyer beware.",1
Jellycat Truffle Dog Large,"As an adult having given this puppy as a gift to another, I cannot vouch for its durability in the hands of young ones; however, this dog is the cuddliest ball of fur with a face that will melt your heart and bring a smile to your face.",5

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Blue Retro","We originally got the Baby Bjorn to carry him around when we are on the move. However, we discovered another use for the BabyBjorn carrier...it's a great way to soothe and calm a crying baby. Whenever our baby cries, we'd put him in the BabyBjorn and carry him around when we do work around the house. He quickly stops his crying and falls asleep.",5
Milk Bands Nursing Bracelet BLUE QTY: 1,"Hey, these are great!! I nursed all 5of my babies in past years. I got so tired and often confused with the shifting of the safety pin from one side to the other..or worse, forgetting to and messing up...remember, start nursing on the side you FINISHED on last feeding. Well this little band is a great, practically free investment! You can track side to start on as well as know when last feeding was...",5
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Backpack,"We were going to buy this but ended up getting it through our insurance but I wanted to post a review . This has a lot of parts but once you get the hang of it its pretty easy to use . I have even assembled it with one hand while holding the baby in the other :) . Its also pretty easy to use according to my wife, you have to hold it a certain way but once she got the hang of it , it was pretty easy.One word of advice , if you are planning on using this every day theres no putting it away ( we are using it to supplement the feedings by pumping in between )  . You are supposed to wash it after every use and it has to air dry so , wash put on a towel or rack to air dry  and by the time it dries you are probably ready to use it again. Since theres a lot of parts its easier this way rather than trying to put it away every time and risk loosing pieces.",4
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,"Everybody raves about this mixer and how it so easily removes lumps from formula. Perhaps that is true for large quantities, but it didn't apply to the smaller quantities we needed to make (4-8oz). The mechanism is flimsy and hard to clean. Our money was far better spent on BlenderBottles. Once you mix formula with them, you won't turn back.",2
One Size Fit All- Diaper Covers for Prefolds or Regular Inserts PUL - PINK,"This cover is stretchy and worth the buy. It holds up to our chubby baby's power pees! She blasts through disposables with little effort, but since switching to cloth (these were our first go at it) I have been pretty happy. They could use more of a gusset in the legs, and may not be suitable for a skinnier baby.Remember moms, the inserts that you will put into a cover like this need to be washed in HOT water at least 5 times to get to maximum absorbancy. If you just buy them and throw them on they won't work well. Make sure you do your homework.Great item for the price! We love em.",4
"Tadpoles Playmat Set, Blue/Cream/Taupe",This was something big enough for my baby to roll and learn to crawl on and now thats she is walking this thing dosent stay together. She loves taking it apart. It dosent have that chemical smell like most of the other mats you find in the stores and easy to clean!,5
Safe T Sleep Travel Sleepwrap Baby Swaddle for Cribs and Beds,"This is the BEST invention for helping non-sleeping babies to sleep through the night! I am not exaggerating when I say my husband and I never slept until we ordered and tried this with our, at the time 4 month old daughter. She had been colicky and was very difficult to get to sleep, keep asleep, etc. She would fall asleep and the minutes we laid her down she'd wake up. So it was musical beds for a month and a half. We'd start out in the swing for 2-3 hours then she'd wake and then it was the fisher price cradle rocker by me on the couch and then finally if hold her in out rocking recliner for the last leg of the night. It was madness and I was going crazy. Then she got too big for the cradle, bassinett, etc and so I decided to try her actual bed. Well by then she had started to roll and would wake herself up about an hour in and couldn't get herself back to sleep. We tried sleep training but wout some way of keeping her securely in place, it would NOT work. So we tried wedges galore, nothing worked. Got this and it worked from night one & on. She has slept 12-13 hrs a night since using the safety sleeper. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. ITS AMAZING!! have baby sleeping trouble-order this and your baby will be sleeping through the night immediately. You may have to do some sleep training-letting them learn to self-soothe-lay down awake, bed routine/cues, but this thing works like gang busters man, best product we have for our baby hands down! Worth EVERY CENT! We got the one that has the extension. Makes travel EASY!! Works same but on any bed, couch, etc. Cannot express my gratitude and appreciation for this product. Baby does not overheat, doesn't confine the baby, it's breathable but warm, comforting and they can still move around just not roll over onto their tummy. Also you will sleep soundly knowing your child isn't crawling out of the bed as they get older. It's just the best thing since sliced bread!!! Can't say enough good things about this.A+++++++!!!!Abs",5

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red","I purchased this carrier and found that once I returned to my pre-baby size it didn't fit.  I am 5ft and have a slight build.  I am not able to pull the straps tight enough to feel that my son is secure.  I am now on my third carrier and it seems to fit perfectly (The Ergo carrier original works, Red Castle Sport is also too big).  If you want to purchase this make sure you try it on and put a real baby into it.",1
"Under The Nile Under The NileBurp Cloths, White, 4-Count","We received a lot of burp cloths when our first baby was born - one pack was from under the nile, the rest were other brands (non-organic, cheaper). The under the nile material immediately felt softer than the others and, after a few washes, all of the other burp cloths started pilling. The under the nile burp cloths seemed to get even softer with each wash. We found ourselves digging through our pile of clean cloths looking for one from under the nile! We wound up buying another pack, and now that we're expecting our next baby, we have gotten rid of all of the other burp cloths. There is really no comparison, especially considering how many times a day we had to wipe our baby's soft, delicate face.",5
"Graco FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Stroller, Grapeade","I wife was dead set on purchasing this stroller.  I was less than pleased when I saw the original cost at other retailers.  So glad I drug my feet and purchased it here.  Arrived the next day and is a great stroller, very well made and solid.",5
The First Years Compass Deluxe Folding Booster Car Seat - Giraffe,"We were looking for a booster seat that my 5yo daughter and I could both agree on. I was concerned for safety since she would be giving up her Evenflo Triumph. She cared about appearence and comfort. My husband has an Evenflo big kid deluxe in his car, and it's okay for short trips. Long trips, which we make quite frequenty, she complained about the seat not being comfortable after awhile. I searched everywhere and found the Compass when I was looking at safety ratings. The seats are wider and plusher from everything else I've seen. Plus, I couldn't resist the adorable giraffe print, and that was a hit with my daughter as well. I also liked how the shoulder strap has a designated area where it goes through and across my daughters chest at the right angle, so she doesn't complain about the strap being so close to her neck. A common problem we have with my husbands booster!",5
"Waterproof Baby Bibs with Snaps for Girls &amp; Boys, Gift Box 10 Pack, Solid Colors",These are awesome - the snap closure keeps the little one from tearing it off his neck; the 10 pack means you always have one around; the terry on both sides with the waterproof insert means they are truly reversible and soft for little skin but effective at preventing drool-soaked clothing.  I love them.,5
Dr. Brown's 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles,"I bought these bottle and Evenflo bottles when my son was born.  What a big difference.  With the Dr. Brown's my son had no problems with gas, burping, or anything.  They have more parts to clean, but it is a small price.  With the Evenflo bottles he kept gulping it to fast and would choke, he had the hiccups a lot and you could here the bottle making a ""vacuum"" noise.  After just two days, I threw away the Evenflo's and bought more Dr. Brown's and have had no problems.  My son had not problems going from breast to bottle.  Best buy ever.",5
Levana BABYVIEW20 Interference Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby Camera,"We've used this monitor for about 5 months now. Contrary to some of the other reviews, I found the audio and video quality to be pretty good (I guess it depends how far away you install the camera). It's enough to see her face so I can reposition her if I don't like her sleeping angles. We paid closer to $200, it looks like it's $130 now.We did have a problem with the monitor's battery, but customer service was good and they resolved the issue.I would buy this item again.-Andrew",4
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub works fine.  It does not pose any safty hazard and is better than just puting baby straight into the tub, but be aware that it does have some problems.  Firstly, it is difficult to keep your baby (who cannot sit - which is the whole purpose of the tub) from drooping over to the side.  It also brags that it is a space saver, but to me that is like a bicycle advertising itself as a space saver simply because the basket on the handle bars is removable...in other words it is an exaggeration.  Lastly, after awhile, the bottom yellow pad starts peeling up and you can not get it to stick back down....I don't feel ripped off or anything, but I am having another baby now and replacing it with a better one.  This one won't even make it to the garage sale...it is going in the trash.",2
Play Wonder Dinnerware Set,"They are made of the most durable, thick plastic. Every toy should be made like this! My 3 and 6 yr old daughters play with them every day. Just two days ago they fashioned their own Thanksgiving dinner, complete with coordinated plates, saucers, bowls and cups from Play Wonder.",5
Disney Princess Castle Dreams 2-Piece Sheet Set,"She loved it.  Her favorite character.  Would order more like this.  You should also order these, your child will love it.",5
Svan Baby To Booster Bentwood High Chair - Natural,"I had planned to buy the Svan Anka, but it was discontinued, so we purchased the Bentwood.  We've been using it for 3 months now.  Pros:  small form factor, folds up and stores easily, easy to wipe down, my 9 month old will sit in it for over 30 minutes, so it must be fairly comfortable.  CONS:  ***the table does not always latch properly and can be pushed off by an excited 9 month old***, hitting her and sending food flying.  It will seem to attach securely at the beginning of the meal, but then becomes loose and has to be re-attached.  The harness/seat belt buckle also gets stuck and is very difficult to undo and the baby gets squirmier the longer it takes to undo the belt.  I would definitely not buy this chair again and I would not recommend it to others.",2
Electronic Digital Caliper 6&quot; with Extra large LCD Display Screen with Carrying Case,"I replaced a lost caliper with this one and it's great for general shop use.  I don't know if it's accurate enough for machining or reloading, but it's perfect for my needs.",5
"Munchkin Dora the Explorer Grip N Sip Juice Box Carrier, Colors May Vary","My granddaughter loves Dora.  This product is perfect for juice boxes or pouches.  Since there seems to be many different sizes of juice boxes, the brand you pick may fit loosely or snugly.  My grand daughter is 22 months, so she doesn't try to pull the boxes out, so the loose ones are fine.  The handles work great, as she can lift and carry around.  Bought two of them - one for Grandpa's house and one for home.  The bottom  and handles are a soft rubbery material, so its easy to grip without slipping, and it provides a non-slip bottom so it doesn't slide easily either.  I am very impressed with the product.  I know I will need to look for other ones besides Dora as my first grandson is coming soon.  Great job Munchkin.",5
"Fresh Baby 2 Pack Collapsible Water Bottle,  Motherhood Motif,  16 Ounce",Got this for a plane trip. It doesn't hold much over 8 oz. The cap to one of the bottles actually arrived bused an unusable. Not a good deal for what you pay for this product.,2
Mute Button Pacifier (Baby Blue),"I thought this was supposed to be a mute button for my cousin's infant but instead it's just a pacifier.  It is a very high quality, BPA-free pacifier, but I found if you really need to silence the baby it just takes a couple good shakes (kidding!)",5
T-228 Plug-in Compact Charger with 4 pcs of Tenergy 9V 250mAh NiMH Batteries,i have had it for a few months no problems so far i would have gone through 6 batteries without it works great in my metal detector that only uses alkaline batteries,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We got this for my 3 year old son to use when sleeping over at our families houses. He had no place to sleep except the floor so I wanted to get something he could use for a while and be comfortable in. First off, I was very relieved to find that there was no bar in the middle of the cot. The bars are underneath the cot and no where does the cot lay on top of any bars. It is low to ground which is nice, if the kid happens to roll off its not a far drop. The size is great. I wish the cot was a little more comfortable with some padding or something but it's a standard cot. My son used it for the first time to stay at a family members house when we weren't there and we were told that he slept on it throughout the night and even walked back in later the next day and laid down to take a nap. Its also great that its compact, light and portable.",4
Medela SoftShells for Inverted Nipples,"I bought this item on my own because I read the wonderful reviews it received. I really don't know HOW this item can be used. Even if you don't use the air-vented cups (which collect the leaking milk), you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing. I was wearing a sweater & you could see the shape of the shells right through it. If you do use the cups they supply, you look absolutely abnormal. I guess this doesn't work for large-breasted women!",1
"Lamaze Crib Soother, Northern Lights","This is a very colorful, entertaining soother.  It can accomodate a MP3 player and besides musical selections, the soother plays pond sounds!  The only problem is that when you start it up, it goes thru a little musical interlude until reaching the song and then to get to the pond sound, you continue to punch buttons.  The other nice aspect is that it is soft, not hard plastic.  Baby can turn it on using the little button on the left hand side.  Something different for the crib!",4
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,"Assembly was a bit rough with the first gate I installed but the second one went much quicker after learning what not to do with the first one. I do recommend using the wall caps for at least the top 2 even if your not using it for stairs. It gives the gate more stability, which is what we need with our dogs. One keeps thinking he can jump it (has yet to make it) and the other keeps trying to lean on it and paw it like he did to get past the wooden ones.Overall it is a solid gate and not that expensive. Happy with my purchase !",5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I'm not a mom. I'm not even a woman, but this thing is awesome. I'm a natural side sleeper and experience that weird pain if my knees touch. To keep that from happening, I sleep with a pillow between my knees. I also hug a pillow and use two for my head. This pillow has changed all of that. It's a weird looking thing, but it's versatile and even makes sleeping on my back comfortable. Big spoon. Little Spoon. Use it to prop up your shoulders, neck, and head. This thing does it all.",5
"Orbit Baby Stroller Panniers, Mocha","I loooove my panniers along with my Orbit G2 stroller. I have used these and the underneath storage while shopping at.. Costco!!! Yes, I have used it multiple times without having to use a cart.  Ive had Costco employees be amazed at how much stuff I can fit in, I even bought a large pack of paper towels and placed them on top of the car seat, where the feet are (because my son is a few month old and doesnt reach the end yet).  Each pannier fits two gallons of milk, those plastic milk jugs.  I just tell you that for reference, so its easy to understand how roomy they are.  They fold when not in use, so that they are still attached but your stroller is not as wide.  I couldnt live without them.",5

"Babiators Unisex-Baby Infant Ops Junior Sunglasses, Black, Small","I totally recommend this sunglasses,  I received a pair of sun glasses for my little one when he was only 6 months old, when i saw them i thought well this will be great for a picture, I did not think that he was going to like them, but to my surprise he loved them now he is almost 9 months and he loves them and he llok great with them",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"This was a really good stroller.  I found a deal at Target one day for a different stroller for $10 on clearance boy was that a mistake, and I have not heard the end of it from my wife.This did a fantastic job on our vacation to the Ozarks.  The straps are adjustable so it can accommodate about any size kid.  I saw some people had problems with the access of the storage compartment on the bottom of it.  I didn't think it was that bad and we were able to fit plastic shopping bags in there no problem and if they didn't fit there you could sling them over the handle.  There was a storage compartment next to the handles which accommodate something to drink and a storage pouch for phone/snacks/wallet.One draw back to it is it is rather long when it is folded up.  If you have a compact car you might have problems storing this and other stuff in the trunk as you might have to store it diagonal in trunk.  In our mid size SUV it would fit widthwise in the back.Overall this is a pretty good stroller for the price and has held up very well.",4
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","We were looking for a gate that we could use to keep our little one away from the fireplace.  This gate works well.  Great for putting out on the deck and for putting little man down to  play for awhile.  Only downside is that our son is 1 and a big boy. He can slide the gate around on carpeting. He is still secure in gate but we often find him, the gate and his toys on the opposite side of the room from where we left him.  The gate comes with foam feet to help it keep from sliding on wood floors. We haven't tried them yet but they may help prevent sliding on carpeting as well.  Not a huge issue for us as he is still secure in side",5
Bummis Reusable Fleece Liners,I love these reusable liners they never stain (for me) and keep the yuck from your cloth diapers. :-) and they are super inexpensive,5
Skip Hop Sort and Spin Fishbowl Sorter Bath Toy,"this is an awesome bath toy!it's simple but fun. the fishbowl's suction cup is STRONG and holds really well on the tiled wall or the tub itself. the toys that fill it up float and squirt. the bowl itself, once held by the suction cup, can spin and dump all the toys out then spin to be right side up again. then all the toys can be stored in the bowl and the water drains out completely when the bath is over.my three year old has so much fun with this toy - it's completely open ended and promotes imaginative play since there's no ""one way"" to play with it.my six month old loves watching the toys bob up and down in the water and i know will love this set more and more as she grows up, too.i've found that simple is best with bath toys. they stay cleanest and ultimately are the ones that are played with most. this one is my favorite because it's totally self contained so it leaves the sides and corners of the tub free from wet toys!love it.",5
Medela Breastmilk Bottle Spare Parts,"Excellent product you always needs spare parts. From time to time, by 10 month old boy, drops or throw one of his breast-milk bottles and has broken two rings already. They still work but they could leak so it's better to put them apart.",5
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I think that Britax delivers just what is promises with this seat-- a seat that is both easy to use and provides as much security as it can for your precious cargo. When my (big) 4-month-old daughter started seeming like she was ready to bust out of the britax companion (infant carrier seat) I knew that it was time for us to move her up to a convertible seat. After having been so satisfied with the britax companion and hearing that britax convertibles were the safest out there, we decided that we were going to shell out the money.  It was a tough decision to choose between the marathon, boulevard, and decathlon.  Ultimately, it came down to the increased protection of the side-impact ""wings"" that made us go with the boulevard. Plus, our daughter had always been a good sleeper in the infant carrier and because of the side-impact headrest, we never found her slumped over to the side.We are thrilled with the seat! As she got to be a little too big for the infant carrier, she had gotten in the habit of crying while in the car if she was awake. Now, she travels happily awake and asleep! She definitely makes good use of the ""wings"" as a headrest during her naps, but she'll also just sit back there and jabber away during her rides if she's not sleepy. I love how easy it is to clip her in.  The seat is incredibly easy to adjust and get to fit her just right. And I can't omit the fact that she looks really adorable back there in her ""big girl seat"" in this cute print-- the online pictures don't do it justice.I have to say that people shouldn't buy this seat because they think it will be a breeze to install.  Good carseat installations take time and attention!!! Although it is ""easy"" to get a good installation, I still work up a sweat making sure that this seat is as secure as possible. I would hate to think that someone might shell out this much money and then do a half-hearted job of installing it securely so that the seat can't function as well as it should in the event of a collision. A seat is only as good as the installation and I encourage people to do a thorough job of installing it, or-- better yet-- get a certified carseat tech to do it for you! (Your local firestation should have details.)PROS: safety, easy to get my child in and adjust the straps to fit, durable and attractive fabricCONS: expensive (although I have to say worth every penny if it protects my baby!) installation takes time and effort (but again, this is how it should be)",4

Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"As the other reviewers have noted, the new Graco Snugride and the new Snap N Go ARE NOT compatible.  My husband called the company and they confirmed that the Graco does NOT snap onto the stroller.  We will also be taking back the Snap N Go and either trying the Kolcraft model or buying the Graco stroller to go with the carseat.Baby Trends should not be allowed to say that the Snap N Go works with the Graco when it clearly does not.  What a joke!",1

Animals Alphabet Baby Nursery Peel &amp; Stick Wall Art Sticker Decals for Boys and Girls,"I was unsure about ordering these because of he reviews.  I'm glad I decided to see for myself.  They are great!  The patterns, colors, and designs are beautiful. The package did come rolled up, which could have caused the edges to lift, but I stuck the package under my matress for a few days and problem solved.  They stuck very well to the wall surface and I peeled one off numerous times to test the adhesion.  Again, zero problems.  Definitely recommend.",5

"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large","My daughter received this for her 4th birthday and it has become her constant companion.  It's extremely well made with a heavy wooden base, does not tip easily, goes fast and can spin in circles ... all around a really great and entertaining toy.  I love how compact and rounded it is as we don't have much space, it lets her have a ball indoors while it's too hot to play outside and she's just figured out she can steer by leaning her body weight and make the mouse spin.  I did see comments about these being 'small', my daughter is tall and lanky and has no problem zipping around on her mouse :)  I've oddly also seen comments about the wheely bugs being too big or hard to use - these are definitely only for children that can put their feet flat on the ground and push themselves with confidence because these babies MOVE, they're on free moving casters and roll way quicker than most other plastic push/ride on type toys.  I have a newly walking baby in the house that likes to push the mouse around sideways but it gets away from him pretty easily, this is not a push toy for babies for sure!",5
Starting Small Frog Novelty Hamper - Green,Just received this item to complete a nursery with a frog theme.  This is an excellent lightweight and cute hamper.  I would definitely recommend this item to others.  It is much nicer then items that are twice as expensive in stores,5
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"These trays have really impressed me.  I have been using them consistently for the past month and have been pleased with them everytime.  The lids seal nicely, and I only need to slightly twist the tray before dispensing the cubes into my freezer bag. I froze a blueberry puree in the trays last night and was concerned I would find the trays discolored the next day.  But nope, the trays cleaned beautifully.  I'm completely satisfied with this product and will likely purchase another set in the future.",5

"Delta Portable Mini Crib, Cherry","I purchased this as an extra crib for my parent's house.  I only get back to see them once or twice a year but needed something for our son to sleep in for during our two week visit.  The crib served its purpose and can be easily folded up and stored under the bed in the guest room.  The mattress it came with was very thin, so I purchased a portable mattress separately.  My son was 5 months old when we used it, and it was a bit small.  He definitely did not have room to spin around like he does in his standard crib.  I recommend this as a second/extra crib.",4

"Kidz Delight Smooth Touch Smart Phone, Black Display","I bought this phone for my one year old for Christmas expecting it to be similar to an actual smartphone since that's how it's advertised and priced, bc he loved our cell phones so much. He's almost 2 years old now and still prefers his $5 play phone over this one. I changed the batteries to be sure they weren't duds....they weren't the product shouldn't be advertised for making noise or lighting up. You can't hear anything, there are no buttons just stickers and I was so disappointed mainly because childrens phones are typically much cheaper than this one, I was willing to pay extra because I thought it would be heavier and more high tech simulating an actual cell phone....I was wrong :-(",1

I think it was worth. its a reaaaly CUTE bed",3
"Kaboost Portable Chair Booster, Green","This really was the perfect fix for my daughter. She would constantly balance on the edge of her booster seat and occasionally fell. Plus, at 5 years old, she was starting to whine about needing a booster seat. This raises the chair but makes her feel like a big girl! The only reason it does not have 5 stars is because my daughter has tried to move or scoot the chair around and occasionally the kaboost has snapped off the bottom. It's just the way she is lifting it, and no one has gotten hurt. Also, it has rubber pads on the bottom that are so non-skid it is difficult to move the chair on a vinyl floor without lifting it. Otherwise, great product, I plan on buying a second one soon!",4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"I purchased these rails when my 19 month old daughter moved from her crib to a ""big girl"" twin sized bed. Although the instructions weren't SUPER easy to understand, assembly was completely doable and took me about 30 minutes from start to finish. The rails are very sturdy, fit very tightly to the mattress and have not torn/bent/etc like you see with many bedrails. I like to research and read reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.com, and I'm  sure that many of you are the same way. I 100% recommend these rails!",5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","It's OK.  I like it, but don't love it.  My daughter loses interest in it rather quickly.  I'm always trying to change up her play routine, so it's a good interactive toy for that.  I don't use it on a car seat or stroller, just her chair she sits semi upright in.  It's easy to adjust and move into position so that's a plus.  The quality is not as it is pictured.",4
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"Overall, I think the Diaper Genie is a good product.  It's pretty easy to use and refill.  I don't think it will be good at keeping the odors concealed once my daughter starts solids.  Right now it doesn't contain the smell of breastfed waste.  Her nursery smells like butter when I walk in.  And I change the Genie at least twice a week.My biggest complaint is not so much the smell, but that you have to push the diaper through to a level before it actually seals the dirty diaper.  Pushing a full diaper home is not my idea of fun.I was in IKEA one day, in the changing room and the diaper pail in there was a pleasure to use.  You just put the diaper in a hole and the top rotates and viola!!  It's gone!  No need to touch anything.",4

"Safety 1st OnSide Air Protect Convertible Car Seat, Adeline Black","I am very happy with this carseat. It is a good quality car seat.Pros:Light weight- I have to take my daughter to the babysitter and leave her car seat. It is lightweight and easy to move.It fits well in small cars- my husband has a ford fiesta and this seat fits easily and he does not have to move his seat far forwardThere is good amount of padding in the head areaThe price is great- if you are looking for a good looking, comfortable, lower price car seat then this is a great choiceCons:It does not recline like some of the other convertible car seats when rear facing.The latch system is not very easy if you are taking it in and out of a car a lot, it has the hook latch not the easy press one like my infant seat had. I use the seatbelt option, that is easier for us.Overall I would recommend this carseat to a friend.",4

"The First Years Secure Adjust Toilet Trainer, Colors May Vary","This seat does adjust well to fit different sized toilets.  The two piece design, however, leaves much to be desired.  If my daughter doesn't sit on the seat just right, pee gets in between the two pieces, then drips out when she takes the seat off the toilet.  It is easy enough to take the pieces apart for cleaning, but there are lots of little crevices that are hard to get to.  The seat is also a bit uncomfortable for her - we will be looking for another alternative.",2
Vulli So'Pure Ball Toy,"My 16 mo loves these balls. I love that they're safe for him to put in his mouth (he is still at the stage where he puts everything in his mouth). They're perfect for his tiny hands.Yes - they tend to flatten when you squeeze them... that doesn't seem to bother my son one bit, though.And they don't squeak - personally I am thankful for that.. we already have enough noisy toys in the house.We've also invested in a bigger ball by Crocodile Creek - and my son seems to enjoy playing with both these balls equally - obviously he can throw the Sophie balls much more easily.I just wish they were slightly cheaper or that we had the option to buy just 1 or 2 balls. We don't really play with all 3 balls at the same time.",5

Munchkin Mighty Grip 10 oz Spill Proof Straw Cup,"This is a great straw cup, easy to clean and doesn't leak.  The only way it does leak is if there is some liquid at the tip of the straw and it gets knocked over or something.  I have some of the other munchkin straw cups that close but they are more of a pain to clean, I LOVE THESE.  I gave this cup to my 18 month old who was just learning how to use a straw and she fell in love with it. I also like it b/c she drinks plenty of water out of this cup.",5
"Joovy Room Playard with Bassinet and Changing Table, Blueberry","I just purchased this for my two year old as a bed in our vacation home, and wished I would have purchased it for home as well! Although she is two and tall, she has plenty of room in length and width to roll over and toss in her sleep. The rails are taller than my pack 'n play, and I do not worry about her being able to climb out. She still in within the weight range to use the changing table as well, however I just set it (changing table/pad) on the bed or the floor for my convenience since I would have to remove it when she was in there sleeping. She loves the mp3 hookup- I was able to use my phone's &#34;sound machine app&#34; and play her white noise through it during her nap. (Was on vacation, did not have an mp3 player, wouldn't normally leave my phone in her room)Easy to assemble, very nice looking and would be perfect for a newborn co-sleeping bed (in your bedroom) or great to travel with, as it has a carrying case with a nice strap. Could check it as baggage easily and I would not worry about its frame being comprimised during airport handling.Only downside is you have to buy Joovy sheets only for it I beleive, which are rather pricey. The graco kind do not fit. But the sheet is by far the nicest crib sheet I have felt!",5

"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue","Overall great product, lots of interesting things to do.  Music/keyboard is nice, and music is less annoying than other baby items we have had.  Only caveat is that we have a pretty small 6 month old, and as others have mentioned, we need to put a book underneath even on the lowest setting for her toes to touch.",4
Sassy Xylophone Musical Toy,"We got this as a Christmas present for our 6 month old daughter.  It didn't work from the start.  I would try replacing the batteries, but this product is purposely designed to make that difficult.  In tiny print on the back of the packaging, it says ""This product contains non-replaceable batteries.""  Why? I would bet that the batteries would be easy to replace if I could open this toy up, but it's put together with non-standard screws with triangular-slotted heads.  One star for this annoying design.",1
Fisher-Price The Perfect Potty Ring,"Perfect for my 16 month old who I'm beginning to sit him on the potty to get familiar with it.  I like the color, it matches my bathroom and how it has a clip to hang it from the toilet tank when not in use so it's just not laying around.  It fits our long toilet seat fine. We have a child's step stool that we place by the toilet as well.  The splash gaurd is great to stop accidents.  Much better buy than these whole potties and way less messy.  Who wants to deal with that? Yuck! Bettet to just train them right on the big potty.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My son has been walking for about a month and we needed something to keep him occupied while strengthening his legs for walking.  It's pretty easy to assemble.  Wish it had ""bumpers"" on it so when it hit the wall, furniture, etc, it won't make a mark or such a big noise.  Bought table foam guards and applied myself and that seems to work.  Adjusts well for tall babies and lots of noises and lights for him to play with.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,This bottle was a life saver.  I didn't think anything about the leaking because babies are washable.  I was able to put her ceral in the bottle before bed time and the hole house got a good nights sleep.  My daughter has less gas and is happy when I put fruit and other things in this bottle.  It's just a wonderful bottle.,4
Mobi Pure Sounds Digital Audio Monitor,Had this monitor for about 2 months. Works great and is sound activated. Very sensitive to the baby's sound so I can hear it even if she breathes hard. Of course I have it on loud but you can turn it down a little and hear mainly the louder noises.,5

"Joovy Nook Highchair, Greenie Fabric","We love this high chair! We live in a small townhouse, so getting a high chair that was sturdy and compact was our goal. We have a TINY dining area and were disappointed with the collapsable high chairs we looked at. They were either cheap or ugly or didn't really fold flat. We had pretty much settled for another chair when a co-worker told me about the Joovy Nook, and we are so glad she did!We got the green chair, which unlike the Amazon pictures, actually is a pleasant lime green instead of yellowish. Setting it up initially was very easy, and directions were clear. The straps are simple to adjust, and we could tell right away that this was a high chair that folds up flat, was very study, and made of high quality materials. The removable tray cover is a nice option for people who would like to remove the surface to soak or put in a drying rack. Our daughter always seems comfortable in it, and there is plenty of padding on the back and bottom of the seat.The best thing about this chair is how easy it is to fold flat and open to a useable position. This is the only piece of baby gear that I have ever used that you can truly collapse or open with one hand. I can collapse it flat or open it easily with my very chunky baby in one hand.We highly recommend this high chair!",5

Kiddopotamus Bibbity Rinse and Roll Bib In Green,"This is one item every Mom needs!  Once your baby is eating baby food and finger foods, this is a MUST.  Right up until they are old enough to be able to do without a bib.  It is adjustable in the back, easy to clean, easy to take along, and best of all, it is a great ""catcher"" for food tasted and rejected, if you know what I mean.  Super product!",5

Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"I used this set with the Medela Pump in style for my daughter (now 20 months) and am about to purchase it again for number two. I went back to work when my daughter was 5 months, but breastfed her till she was 11 months, so had lots of experience with the set, which was small convenient, easy to use and interchangeable with other niples and bottles for when she got older.  My only complaint is that I culdn't buy a steam steriliser to accompany the set (as you can with Avent systems) as boiling the bottles every day was a real chore.",4
Safety 1st Crystal Clear Nursery Monitor,"I spent so much time trying to place this monitor in a location where it doesn't play static. The amount of static varies based on whether it's plugged in (more static) or using battery power, where it's placed on the table, and whether or not you're touching it. It's so aggravating that I find myself relocating so I can hear my son myself rather than listen to the annoying static. I'm currently on the market for a new one.",1

Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up,I love that this seat fits over the toilet so I don't have to clean a training potty; however it needs some sort of function that will secure it to the adult potty. Maybe just some clips that would hook to the installed seat or something. My daughter wouldn't sit on the potty until we got this seat. Now she likes climbing up there on her own! I am hoping this makes potty training a little easier on us all!,3

"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I just want to say how much I love my moby wrap. When I first got it I thought it might be complicated to figure out, but once we looked at the video of how to do it and did a few times it was a piece of cake. Now we use it several times a day for our 4 week old daughter. It really calms her down. It is so much better than some of the other baby carriers that do not promote the closeness that this one does.",5

"Skip Hop 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set, Treetop Friends","I have been debating buying this bedding for my little girl. I really liked skip hop activity mat with treetop friends and we came across it at a store and my husband being the harshest critic Loved it. I tried to check out the bedding for treetop friends and could not really find it anywhere. From the pictures the skirt looked dark brown and i didnt like that. Also bumper pads looked flimsy and cheaply made from the pictures. bumper pads are beautifull and just enough thickness. I love the quality. very cute. in the picture you dont see on upper part of the comforter , there is a little cute bird picture too. skirt color is not dark brown. it is more like muted down brown , more light mocha. Sheet is a good quality. SOOO neutral yet cute enough for a girl:) I have also found matching wall decal. It wouldnt been flawless if skip hop made mobile to match with it because all the owls and squirrels will be just soo cute:) Also wanted to add I washed all the bedding in delicate setting and came out great.so here is the wall art. it is from etsy.com ---  [...]copy and paste will work . i hope:)",5

BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This has turned out to be a great little potty for our little boy.  He is tall for his age but still fits on here easily. Thankfully we have very few messes to clean up as the front shield does a great job of preventing any target practice around the bathroom.  It is also easy to clean, if still disgusting.  But really what potty chair isn't?  At this point I can't think of anything I would change about this potty chair.  Our son really likes the color and the fact that he can dump it out into the &#34;big potty&#34; and flush.",5

These are the best designed stroller hooks on the market without a doubt.",5
Earlyears Roll n Swirl Ball Ramp,"Unfortunately I bought this toy thinking my son would be interested in playing with this neat new toy which I had found amusing, but sadly he was not.

Kiddyloo Toilet Seat Reducer (Blue/Green) - Toddler Potty Training Seat,"Before purchase(in 2007)I spent many weeks researching--asking friends and professionals for recommendations, what was important for them, what things I should consider when deciding, and things to avoid. On top of that I read as many reviews and discussion as I could on the web. I had too many friends who had to purchase 2, 3, or 4 potties before finding one that worked and I quite frankly did not have money for that. So I decided to go with a toilet seat reducer.I purchased the Kiddyloo as it looked to be sturdy, easy to clean, easy to use, easy to store and attractive to small children. It was indeed! Our nearly 2-year-old daughter liked the look of it, and right away noticed the frog face embossed on the step which is lightly textured to help with traction. She was excited to try it right away. It took about a week before we successfully had a splash-down, but within a few weeks of the first, she was fully potty trained and excited about it. The seat appears to be very comfortable and has suited her size from 20 months to 3 years of age. She has never complained of lost circulation, pinches or other discomfort even when she has sat upon it for 10 minutes to read a book. Her bottom has gotten a pink ring after that time, but she said it did not hurt. The step is stable and roomy enough to stand and turn on without problem. It took some time for her to master the turn herself, but there is sufficient area allowed for the hand grip and it is well designed.The worst and only injury she has gotten from this potty is a pinched finger when she was trying to move the potty herself (not recommended by manufacturer) and the potty folded down upon the legs (and thus her finger) as it is designed to do. As it is all very light weight there was no real injury or harm done. Just some temporary pain from a pinch.The only draw backs we experienced are in assembly, which was very straight forward. It is designed to be assembled with a Euro coin (at least the European version is). I found coin assembly to be a bit cumbersome. Even so, I mastered it by the third screw. They are giant plastic screws with a coin-sized slot on the head. I adjusted the height of the step once, and it was easy enough to unscrew and re-screw. And a coin allowed for sufficient torque to tighten securely without damaging parts.The last huge plus is that this unit is easy to clean and sanitize with a cloth and cleaning solution as it has large, smooth surfaces.UPDATE: We used this aid for about a year before we lent it to a friend's child who also experienced immediate success with it, quenching the child's fear of the grown-up toilet. In the time we used it, the unit never tipped or caused an accident other than that pinched finger. We were extremely satisfied with this product and recommend it highly.",5
Cotton Tale Designs Big Equipment Decorator Lamp,"I bought this lamp for my newborn son's room.  It is very cute!  I thought the truck was made of a soft material, but it is hard plastic.  The price was a little rediculous, but I watched and waited for the price to go down.  When I first looked, it was around $50, but I got it for $30.  So, beware of the frequent price changes on here!",4
"Kushies Waterproof Change Pad, Cream Polka Dots","Neither the product description nor the packaging tells you that this pad has a vinyl backing -- you have to read the fine print on the back of the label to find that out. I'm trying to avoid vinyl for my baby, so this is getting returned!",1

"Graco Swing By Me Portable 2-in-1 Swing, Little Hoot","This swing is very cute. That's about the only thing it has going for it.  It's noisy, the harness padding slips off super easily, my baby is under the weight limit but don't fit comfortably in the harness, also the swing never did swing correctly. It would stop all the time and I had to push it together it going. (And yes I replaced the batteries) Lastly, my 5 month old weight 18 lbs and is 28.5inches long and the swing won't swing anymore.  Do yourself a favor and buy a different one.",1
"Bumkins Flushable Diaper Liner, Neutral, 100 Pack",Very easy to use and effective too. I would recommend it to my friends and I will be buying more soon...,5
Floppy Seat,"I hate to think of all the germs in shopping carts.  I always used this seat cover and never let my son touch the shopping carts or restaurant high chairs.  Too bad at 26 months he is now too big for it and now sits in those germ infested car shopping carts.  Oh well.  Purchase this product and you won't be disappointed.  I washed it often and it lived in the trunk of my car.  I do have to say that I did not put it in the carry bag form because it took too long to get it that way, but it didn't matter anyway it was quicker to put it in the grocery cart when it was not in the bag form.  A great baby shower gift!",5
Vulli Chan Pie Gnon Natural Rubber Teether - Blue Chan,I think my dog likes it more than my daughter.  It has a squeaker that's a bit obnoxious.  Our daughter is 6 months and putting everything in her mouth.  I thought she'd love it but it's a no go as of now.  We'll try again later I guess.  I just have to hide it from the dog!UPDATE!  We tried it again and she loves it at 7 months.  We'll put a bunch of toys in front of her and she will go for this one - she loves the squeaker and gnaws on it like crazy....  But we still have to hide it from the dog :),3
"Munchkin Click LockDeluxe Snack Catcher, Blue/Green, 2-Count",I love this snack catcher however my son did not! They are perfect size for my toddler but he didn't like sticking his hand into the flexible opening. I also loved that it has a resealable cap (that folds under the catcher) to keep the snack fresh!  Just wish he would use them! Maybe I keep them and try again when he is a little older.,3
"SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket, Dots and Hearts, Fuchsia","As a first time mom I received a ton of blankets, in those I was given one of these, best blanket ever! It makes swaddling so easy, and for those nights where you want the baby warm this thicker fabric is awesome! We used it so much we had to buy 2 more otherwise we would have been doing laundry all the time.  Highly recommend, worth the price.",5
"Bummis Fabulous Wet Diaper Bag, Green, Small","We've used this bag for 6 and a half months, washing it with the rest of the diaper laundry and hanging to dry.  It's done a very good job containing wetness, and a so-so job containing odors.  It's thin and easy to find space for it in the diaper bag.  However, the handle came unstitched in the wash last week (I see others have had this problem), and now the interior of the bag is de-laminating.I investigated today and found that Bummis' warranty extends for 6 months after the purchase date.  I'm sad that this wet bag is so utterly destroyed, but maybe I didn't have realistic expectations for the lifetime of a wet bag?  (Six months seems to be Bummis' expectation?)  We have a wet bag by Planet Wise that we use just as often-- but we've had it longer--and it's holding up well.I could recommend this bag for occasional use, but be prepared to buy another one several months down the line!",3
"The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup, Disney Princess","We've tried many different cup makers and styles to find the right one in each stage of our twins' development. These, because they specifically say spill-proof and change colors, are pretty cool cups. Problem is the packaging does NOT say leak proof. Of the four we purchased, three leak like a sieve. It wouldn't be nice to tell person who designed them what I'd like to do with the leaky cups but you can sure guess what I'd like to do. If you are even slightly considering these, DON'T! Instead, run to the nearest store, buy a 1/2 pint of cold milk, and pour it into your child's car seat while they are sitting in it. That way you get the same effect but without the expense of the cups.",1

"Prince Lionheart Seat Neat, Black/Grey","This has protected our leather covered kitchen chairs VERY well. It is definitely one of those purchases I have never regretted and felt it was worth every penny of the thirteen dollars I spent on it. Without it, the chair under my son's booster seat would not only be constantly filthy, it would also probably be damaged from the booster seat. I would definitely recommend this product.",5
"Babiators Unisex-Baby Infant Ops Junior Sunglasses, Black, Small","I have looked for glasses that would protect my grandson's eyes from the harmful UV rays and these do just that.  They look nice, are durable and fit well.  I cannot believe how cute he is with these on.",5

"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Diaper Pail, White","Very nice.  Had heard bad things about diaper genies, mainly that they aren't robust.  This one is.  Easy to use, easy to refill bags, and really contains the small.  Once the bag is really full, may not smell like roses, but is to be expected.  Even with a well-destroyed diaper, still easy to get into the container while holding the baby.",4
"Stork Craft Beatrice 5 Drawer Chest, White","I read other reviews that said it was headache, but I went ahead and purchased this item because it's less expense than anything I else I saw. I should have listened... I ordered it in Feb, it is now May and we still don't have the dresser together. There were pieces missing, and a major piece broken. When you try to call, the line is busy. I had to hang up and redial, what felt like forever. They said my piece would come in 3 weeks, it was more like 7 weeks. The piece that was broken had the drawer rails on it, but when it came, it had no rails. So, I said I wanted to return the entire thing, they were fine with it, but it can take up to 8 weeks to get your money back.  So, at this point in time, we are going to go to the hardware store to buy what we need so that I can have a dresser in my son's room.",1
Baby Care Play Mat - Pingko Friends (Large),"I am a teacher in an infant room at a very popular preschool and bought this mat for my class! I LOVE it! The farm scene is AWESOME (guinea pigs included!) and I love the alphabet animals.  It is a great size;  my assistant and I and four or so infants fit comfortably during playtime! When I got it out of the box, the smell mentioned was only noticeable if I put my face very close to the mat and it dissipated after a day or two. Plus, there was a 10% off code when I bought this. PURCHASE THIS MAT if you are a mother currently or going to be. It is great!",5
Preggie Pop Drops (21 Pieces) - Assortment of Sour Flavors ( Multi-Pack),"These seem to work well to help subside nausea and queasiness. However, it's basically just candy so if I eat more than just a couple I feel kind of gross just from all the sugar (3 candies is 12grams)... I don't usually eat much sugar and candy, so for me, it's a little much.Side note: seemed like these took FOREVER to get to me in the mail, and there was no tracking available. Took a week and a half for me to get these, and when you are nauseous, that is a long time to wait.",4
Gorilla Playsets Infant Swing,"This swing was a huge disappointment.  It came in a box with no instructions.  The swing has two different rings on the hanging ends that we were never able to figure out what to do with them and how it was supposed to be hung.  We ended up buying hardware to hang it through the rope loops bypassing the confusing rings.  Once we finally had the swing up we realized that no matter what we did it leaned forward.  After paying $20 for the swing, $20 for shipping and $11 on hanging hardware we are junking the swing adn looking for a new one that is better made.  Dont waste your money on this trash.",1

"Bummis Swimmi Cloth Diapers, Turtles, Small (9-15 lbs)","I had bought a size medium Bummi Swim Diaper last summer and wound up never using it. This year, since my son is a year older, I purchased a new swim diaper.  After reading reviews, I went with an iPlay swim diaper, size X-large (my son is 19 months and 28 lbs which, according to the sizing and all the reviewers, it should have fit.)  I stupidly didn't have him try it on and this morning, on the day of his first swim lesson, found that it was too small and I couldn't snap it around his waist.  I remembered that I had the old Bummi laying around and prayed it might be usable - it was a tad small, but because of the velcro, I was able to make it work and fit around his waist.  The diaper worked GREAT, the velcro held well and I'm nor ordering a couple more Bummi's in the appropriate size.",5

Circo&reg; Baby Knit Stripe Hooded Towel - Green,I am not very impressed with this hooded towel.  The fabric is very thin (not very absorbant) and kind of scratchy.  I know the price is really good but compared to some of the other hooded towels out there i'd rather spend a little more for better quality.,2
"Storksak Olivia Diaper Bag, Moss","I love love love this bag. I have used it now for over six months. I love the interior pockets and I especially love all the outside pockets- there are 4 pouches on the outside, plus the zipper pocket that I use for  my wallet (which is the small black bag that comes with it.) I love how you have a cross body strap, so you can be hands free and also have the option to put over your shoulder. I bought the storksak stroller clips and I love using those with my stroller. It is easy to clean and I can cram so much in this bag- seriously it is always filled to the brim. I love the look of the bag- I have gotten a lot of compliments on it! BUY THIS! You won't be sorry!",5

"Graco DuoGlider Classic Connect Stroller, Dragonfly","The seller made no mistakes about this.  It shipped fast and high quality.  The only problem was the information from the manufacturer that said it had a 5-Point harness for each child, which we wanted since our 18 month old likes to climb out.  But, again, not the seller's fault.  Easy to turn and maneuver.  Convenient features.  All around nice stroller.",3
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Blue Dog, X-Large",This blanket is great. I have used these on my daughter since she was 4 months old and I love them.

I will not be purchasing anything from this manufacturer again.",1
Loveybums Wool Pull-up Diaper Cover - Pink - medium (9-22 lbs.),"This is a very adorable, yet functional cover. I got a size Medium which fit my newborn perfectly. She was a hefty 10 pound, 4 ounce newborn but lost a tiny bit of weight as newborns do, and it fit perfectly. It aired her bottom out nicely during the day. I never used it at night as it's just too light of a cover for that, but PERFECT for day time use. Got a bit of newborn poop on it, and it stained, but the actual poop washed out easy peasy. A fitted worked great under it. The pink cover is lovely!",4
"Woombie Winter Fleece Baby Swaddler (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Eggnog)","This Woombie swaddler is easy to use and keeps the baby warm and snuggly while allowing the arms to move around.  We had tried velcro swaddlers in the past, which were nice, but the velcro tended to wear out, and our baby could sometimes wiggle out of them.  Our house temperature is cooler than most in the winter (between 63-68F), so the fleece of the winter Woombie keeps our baby warm.  On colder nights (when the house is below 65F), we wrap another blanket around the Woombie.  I would have given this five stars, except that I thought the sizing was a little off.  I purchased this for my newborn when she was three weeks old (8.5 pounds, 21.5 inches), and it was almost too small.  Her feet couldn't stretch out all the way.  It says it's sized for 5-13 pounds, but I think the upper limit is not possible.  We returned it and purchased the next size up, which has worked great!  I might buy a summer weight Woombie, if my baby still needs to be swaddled when it's warmer.The Woombie is a little more expensive than other swaddlers I have used, but it's worth the price.  The fleece fabric is thicker than most, the zipper is heavy duty, and it is easy to wash and dry.  I'm sorry that I didn't know about the Woombie when my older child was a baby.  Great product.",4
MobiCam Audio Video Baby Monitoring System,"I HATE this thing and wish I would have gotten a different one.  for one thing it SUCKS battery's so fast!  would have been nice to have a chargeable handset.  takes 6 AA batteries and if you've got the screen on it'll last like a night.  when my daughter was about 4 months old it started buzzing.  there's this LOVELY buzzing/staticy type noise that makes it almost imposible to hear the baby without turning way up and then annoying yourself with the stupid buzzing.  Now the screen also gets staticy and fuzzy at random times and last night the screen just went blank and no sound randomly.  I'm soo frustrated with this thing!!!  Don't waste your money, other's might be more expensive but they're probably a heck of alot better quality than this piece of junk",1

"Lambs &amp; Ivy Changing Pad Cover, Little Hoot","We bought this for our second child. With our first, we quickly realized soft fuzzy covers made changing easier, so I sought out a few new ones for our second. This is the deepest pile I've found and we hope the new one loves it.",5
Precious Moments&reg; Prayer Doll - Girl,Doll arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised. She's adorable & sounds great. My daughter loves her & is even able to press her belly (to turn her on) herself.,5
"Room Magic Natural 5 Drawer Chest, Magic Garden","I really do like this nice solid piece of furniture.  The problem that we had was the reversible drawer fronts did not fit correctly and rub when when you open and close the drawer.  I called Room Magic and they were helpful and gave us the option of having new fronts sent, we could have sent the whole thing back, or we could have made the the drill holes slightly bigger to lower the drawer faces.  We fixed it and I think it is beautiful.",3
"Safety 1st Complete Air Protect 65 Convertible Car Seat, Great Lakes",We looked at a lot of different car seats and found for the time we want to use a car seat and not need to buy a new one this was the one we needed.  The day we went home from the hospital my son was sitting in the car seat.  He was a little more than a month premature and weighed in at 5lb5oz and was fine.  Pillows on the side of the head were a bit too high for him for the first three months but then he grew enough to get comfortably.  He now knows when he is siting in it it is time to go!  he loves it!!!,4
Blueberry Pacifier Holder,"I've been using this bink link for 7 months now ever since my friend gave me one of hers to use. I can't say enough good things about this thing! It's the perfect length, it's cute, it clips to everything and my baby loves using it as a teether, too! The link is very well made and durable -- I'm not afraid of it coming apart at all. I love how it's ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) approved and guaranteed lead-free and doesn't dissolve paint when wet. Be warned, though... my dogs LOVE to chew on this thing and think it's a doggie toy whenever we get careless and leave it out within their reach! They've chewed through 4 of them to date but I love them so much I always end up buying new ones! It's worth the cost!",5

"Vital Baby Press 'n' Pop Mini Freezer Pots, Orange, 1 Ounce - 32 Pack","we use  them for everything.  yes they are great in the freezer. also  in the purse, the garage, the desk......  we use them for everything that could fit in them!",5
Baby Einstein Touch and Explore Discovery Book,I would like to see something very similar but with more pages. I had assumed that the 3 tab would open to another page but does not. I bought this for my grand daughter who will be 1 year on the 25th of Oct. - a few days away. She enjoyed it for the first few minutes but lost interest quickly. I think it is the kind of toy you introduce and when the baby loses interest just put it away for a week or two and reintroduce it as something new. I believe she will get more enjoyment out of it when she can follow the instructions such as touch the guitar or touch the piano etc. On the plus side it is nearly indestructable and inexpensive as well as something that can easily be packed as a take-a-long toy.,4
Antimicrobial Activity Mat,I use the hooded towel for my son and I like it so I bought the play mat too. He's 7 month old and starting to sit up and plays while he's sitting. When we go to our music class together I bring the mat and it's a good plce for him to sit because its big. I can sit on it with him too. I don't use it at home that much because he has another activity mat that is colorful and lights up and plays music.  But this one is good for bringing to places where there will be other babies.,5

BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,"This was a Christmas gift for my 11 month old grandson, and he loves it because his toys are right there.",5
"Babycity Suede Microfiber One Size Pocket Diaper with Snap Closure, Pink","Not like Alva diapers. It doesnt come with an insert, plus they run smaller than the alva one size diapers.",2
"Graco LiteRider Stroller, Tango in the Tongo","I was looking for a lightweight foldable stroller with good storage, a decent sunshade, and child tray that could double as a high chair.This stroller has all of that and handles very well. However, it has some design problems that could be improved upon: 1) the wayit folds up, the child tray bangs on the ground quite forcefully.  It can get dirty and seems destined to break, but it's made of flexible plasticso maybe it can take that kind of stress  2) the padded metal baron the seat back is very low--my 14 month old's head already hits it,although she sits up and doesn't touch the back usually. I was hopingto use the stroller until she is 3 and I don't know if that's going to work.3) one of the cupholders on the parent tray is so shallow that water bottlescan fall out. The other one is OK.",3

Fitted Pack N Play Sheet in Traditional Blue Print,"I am impressed with these sheets, they fit my graco pack n play perfect, they are very soft, and they are just thick enough that you can not see the print of my pack n play mattress through them.",5
"Bummis Bio-Soft Liner, Small","These things are great for dealing with toddler poo! It's stinky and sticky, so with these liners, you just pick it it up and drop it in the toilet!",5
Black Gingham Fitted Crib/Toddler Sheet,"Nothing fancy and a little over-priced for the quality (the edges aren't nicely finished, just quickly sewn onto a strip of elastic), but over-all I am happy with this fitted sheet.",4
"NUK Latex Colored BPA Free Replacement Spout, Colors May Vary","I got these as a replacement for the silicone spouts since my daughter kept tearing them while teething.  These are not as easy to rip, however, they are expensive for just one spout.  It is less expensive to buy a new sippy cups, which I have done since I found Pampers cups for $3 each and they are less leaky than Nuk.",5
The First Years Sit and Store Parent Bathing Seat and Stepstool,"This stepstool/seat/storage is great!!!  I can even put a pink tub in there to travel with and put tub toys, washcloths, lotion, shampoo, rinse cup and more.  It's a lot bigger than I expected and very sturdy.  Excellent purchase to travel with for all bathing needs and then you have a stool for the kids at places like hotels and grandmas house. :)",5
"Motorola MBP26 Wireless 2.4 GHz Video Baby Monitor with 2.4&quot; Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan and Tilt","I'm not sure how much babies like disembodied voices, but the two way speakers are nice.  Pan & Scan is also a great little feature, you can view the entire crib as well as around it.Night-vision works well with the infra-red lights in a pitch-back room.  The baby's room had a night-light though, and the night-camera was far too sensitive.  To make up for this, we put tape over the infra-red lights on the camera and got a great picture.",5
"Boon Flair Pedestal Highchair with Pneumatic Lift,White/Orang","It's easy to clean, it looks great and I love the adjustable height function.  My 6 month-old is comfortable and happy to be in this chair after eating long enought to give me a little extra time to wash up!",5
"Dexbaby Safe Lift Universal Crib Wedge, White","My baby has AR so I ordered this crib wedge for her.  It goes underneath sheets.  However, I'm not sure if its the wedge or just my baby, but she rolls down off of the wedge by the middle of the night.  Which kinda defeats the purpose of the wedge.  I'm keeping it in there though as at least it works for a few hours and soon I wont be swaddling her anymore and hopefully she doesnt move around as much as she gets older.",3
Medela Soft Fit Breastshields 24mm - Medela 67246,"Comfortable and easier to carry than regular shieldsI like the feel of these flexible shields better than the regular stiff plastic shields. These are also slightly shorter than the regular shields which makes them more convenient for carrying in a pumping bag. Cleanup is the same as with regular shields, and so far I think they are just as durable.One star off for not making them in different sizes (different radius, i.e. 21mm) like their regular plastic shields.",4
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,Great video monitor - especially for the $.  My wife and I couldn't stand the thought of not being able to see our new baby and now we can actually afford to.  Now we just need to move him out of our room so we can use the monitor.,5
Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker,"I received this as a very generous, surprise shower gift, for which I am grateful. As a first-time, clueless mom, being armed with this gadget made me confident to venture into making my own baby food, which I'm glad I did.The first few times I used this, I was thrilled. However, I soon realized that, although convenient in theory, this just wasn't a practical way for me to cook my son's food.Here's the kind of cook I am: I like making food, but I love when I can cook in the most efficient ways possible. When making baby food, this means I am totally willing to do the work, but would rather do it once or twice a week and make big batches to last the week or freeze for later. If that sounds like you, you should save your money--this is not the most efficient machine for that.I imagined myself whipping up quick, ready-to-serve dinners for my son in 20 minutes flat. Again, just not practical in reality. Even if you have the food prepped ahead of time, once you steam and puree it (which is not exactly what I'd call quick), it is HOT. OK, yes, I understand the food has been steamed and is therefore going to be extremely hot, but anyone with a hungry baby knows you don't really have a ton of extra time to wait for piping hot sweet potatoes to cool down before dinner is served. I've also found that the blending mechanism is just okay--not terribly powerful, not a big capacity, and I often have to stop mid-blend and scrape down the sides. It's kind of a pain to clean too. Plus, the ""pitcher"" component and lid of mine have definitely become slightly warped from the extreme heat of steaming.I thought this would be THE all-in-one machine for making baby food. However, considering my reality, it's just so-so. I have a Vitamix blender and much prefer that. It doesn't steam, but to me, doing a big batch or two of baby food in at most three steps (prep if needed, steam if needed, blend) is preferable over cooking five small, individual batches of sweet potatoes in a row, each of which takes 20 minutes in the Beaba Babycook.If I had spent my own money on it, I'd be more disappointed. It's not terrible--just not the best or most practical solution for me.",3
KidCo Spring Action Cabinet Lock 4-pack,"Loved these latches when my kids were little. Now with a brand new remodeled kitchen, I am using them to keep those upper cabinets from flying open during a California earthquake! Buy a few extra in case the springs pop off and get lost!",5
"Ju-Ju-Be Be Prepared Diaper Bag, Black/Silver","I've had this bag for about two years and chose it because I cloth diaper and knew I would need the space and I'm an over packer (I find the day that I don't bring something I end up needing it). I love this bag basically for every reason that all the previous reviewers stated.  It's HUGE, can hold everything and then some. I was a FTM when I bought it and basically packed everything possible I needed for my baby for the day out and overseas travel from bibs, nursing cover, baby carrier, extra clothes, bottles, cloth diapers, wet bag, toys, snacks, you name it it was in my bag! I love how organized you can be with all of the pockets. The mommy pocket is perfect to keep my things separated from his and also to hold little items of his (medicine, etc.).  A few gripes I have is having the the snack pocket in the same pocket as the changing mat. Just the idea of having a changing mat, where I clean my son's butt on, next to his snacks grosses me out (I usually just fold the changing mat and put it in the pocket between the main compartment and mommy pocket).  But now I have this huge pocket with just a few things in it, kind of a waste of space. Also, I have this bag in all black, as I wanted a unisex bag that my husband wouldn't be embarrassed about holding, and it's definitely showing some wear now.  There's a few scratch marks on it that make it look like I've had it for years. I think the patterned ones may be better in that respect. And finally this bag is HEAVY completely empty, so you can imagine how heavy it gets when it's fully loaded. I didn't think the 3 or 3 1/2 pounds it weighs would be a big deal but it really does, especially when you can't hang it on the back of an umbrella stroller and are forced to carry it. At one point it just got too heavy to carry, I wore my son in his sling and stuck the bag in the stroller seat. But now that my son is in full toddler mode, has no patience for baby wearing, and needs to be strapped in his stroller when we're out and about, it's a pain, especially when traveling. I wish it had wheels so I could drag it along.  I didn't want to give up my bag for a wheeled carry on and it was so heavy carrying it through airport terminals and trying to lift it onto the overhead compartments on planes. I've since had to switch to another diaper bag, that is smaller and lighter, but I miss my jujube.  I will say that it is really well constructed (especially compared to this new diaper bag that is already falling apart after 4 months of use!). Because I love it so much I'm still giving it four stars.",4
"Evenflo Triumph Advance LX Convertible Car Seat, Harbortown","We needed a larger seat since our daughter grew out of her infant seat's weight limit. I did a lot of research and this seat was given high ratings with Consumer Reports. The price was very reasonable. I love how the shoulder strap is easily adjustable from the front, that the straps are tightened by turning a dial on the side of the seat, that the seat cover is easily removable for washing, and that there is a crumb catcher right under where the baby sits. I will be keeping this seat rear-facing as long as I can. So far, my daughter really seems comfy. You should buy this seat!",5
"Mommy's Helper Inflatable Bath Tub Froggie Collection, White/Green, 6-18 Months","This inflatable tub works great for me and my little guy, he is almost sitting by himself and the tub offers a perfect amount of support.  We haven't had any problems with him being squished or uncomfortable, there is plenty of room for him to kick, splash and reach for his toys.  It is easy to inflate and drain, I only blew it up once and we have been using it for one month.",5
"DaVinci Kalani 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry",Bought matching crib and changing table.  Nice color and sturdy.  Is assembled but not in use yet (baby only 6 weeks old) but look forward to using it.,5
Graco Vie4 Stroller in Super Saurus,It is very nice. Good for shopping. A little bulkier than I thought. Had a hard time fitting it into my Mitsubishi trunk. It does well on every terrain. Would need another light weight stroller to compliment this one.,4
Bellybuds&reg; | Baby-Bump Sound System,"This is so much fun....I play different types of music throughout the day for baby, and he kicks and dances and makes all kinds of wonderful movements!",5
Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,"I liked this warmer, it is very easy to use, the water container has a nice shape that prevents any leaks when you refill it. I have twins, if you also have twins like I do, be advised that if you warm a second bottle just after the first one, the water in this unit will be warm and your bottle formula will be much hotter at the same amount of minutes than the first one.",4
Simmons Kids Full Size Metal Bed Rails Metal,this was perfect. I  love it.  my baby  girl finally has her  own  bed.  thank  you  so much.great  merchandise,5
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"Took this on a trip to Asia with our 2 1/2 year old daughter and it was a lifesaver when only squat toilets were available.  Was really surprised at the size - it really did fit in my purse (kind of a medium-sized purse); takes up about as much room as the plastic fold-into-quarters potty seat that we use in public in the US.  Bought the liners as didn't want to be figuring out yet one more thing at the moment of truth.  We normally use public facilities at home but will now carry this as a back-up in the event that we aren't near a rest-stop, or that they are dirty.  Very easy to set up and use - little one wanted to try it as soon as I took it out of the box from Amazon.  Would recommend this to anyone who plans long road trips; trips to other countries where facilities are different styles; or who would like another option when regular facilities are just too foul.",5
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"Sound quality is very good, as is range. It operates on a voice activation principle where voice has to exceed a threshold - 1 of 5 levels. I've found that these thresholds are rather high. Even at level 4, you won't be able to hear your baby's breathing, for example. If you choose level 5, you *will* hear every noise, but the monitor will be on all the time, and battery life will suffer. The unit has a nice ""walkie-talkie"" feature so that the person holding the ""parent"" unit can speak to the person in the room with the ""child"" unit. The nightlight feature is so dim as to be basically worthless. It would be more convenient if the ""child"" unit were designed to fit into a base for recharging, because one is less likely to recharge it by plugging in its adapter cord.This is a good baby monitor. It's a bit pricey for what it offers, given that $50 more will get you a monitor with video capabilities, but it does offer digitally encrypted transmissions that probably won't interfere with other devices or computer networks. The Sony Baby Call costs about $50 less, offers two receivers, but uses a much more basic communications system susceptible to eavesdropping and does not have a walkie-talkie feature.",4
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"This carrier is terrific! With my son I purchased a Snugli &amp; never used it. It was uncomfortable &amp; hard to use. With my daughter I decided to splurge &amp; try the Baby Bjorn based on word of mouth. I am now the #1 fan! This carrier is very comfortable for both Mom &amp; baby and is perfect for Moms on the go who need their hands free.  I have used it grocery shopping, in the mall &amp; in restaurants. It is simple to use, I can load my daughter in it one handed and is perfect for soothing baby when you're out and about. My daughter usually falls asleep in it. Believe the hype Baby Bjorn is worth the money.",5
Clay Hanging Keepsake Kit (Makes 2 Plaques),I really liked this kit. The instruction were clear and it was very easy to make. I love my baby's hand and foot print!,5
Gerber Nipple Brush (Colors vary),These are hard to find. Love it. Does not take up much space. Most stores only carry the double ended ones like this.,5
"Summer Infant Custom Fit Walk-Thru Gate, Tan","This baby gate is great! It is flexible, so it can be adapted to my strange arrangement.  I am confident I will continue to be satisfied, my child is not quite mobile yet.",5
Lito Baby Boys White Navy Sailor Romper Hat Set 6-12M,"I received the sailor suit in immaculate condition.  The buttons were a ship's wheel instead of the anchor, so no problem with the anchor being sewn on wrong.  The outfit was perfectly pressed.  I can't speak to size or fit as the baby is not due yet.  I bought the 6 to 12 month size rather than risk getting one that was too small.  Actually received the item in a shorter amount of time than predicted which worked out great as I had procrastinated and thought it wouldn't arrive in time for the shower.",5
Soho Spring Time Butterfly Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 14 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"I recently purchased the 10pc spring time butterfly bedding from Soho, and i'm utterly impressed by the quality of the product.  I'm in the process of decorating my twin baby girls bedroom and was able to coordinate other items to match this beautiful set.  Can't wait to put it in their cribs once there up. I will definitely be purchasing and recommending Soho designs to other consumers.  Thanks Soho for being affordable.  My only gripe is the price of the shipping considering i purchased two bedding sets and had to pay $17.49 a piece for shipping.  Soho there has got to be a way to decrease the shipping cost or give discounts for multiple purchases.",5

"Delta Canton Full Size Wood Bed Rails, Black","Like everyone else, I have the Simplicity Ellis Crib.  Mine is the cherry finish and these rails matched perfectly.  They also fit perfectly.  So glad I was able to find these, the bed looks really nice.  Also, if you own the simplicty crib, check into the recall.  If yours has the tubular mattress support, it was probably recalled.  Mine was, still waiting to hear what Babies R Us is going to do since Simplicity is now out of business.",5
Seat 2 Go Safari Stroller Attachment,"I bought this and would like it except it won't work on my stroller (Kolcraft Contours Double).  The 3rd stabilization bar that is absolutely important for the standing position, will not attach because the distance is too great and wouldn't sit parallel to the ground if I could get it on.  The seat is about 3-4 inches too high for my daughter's head to keep from hitting the parent tray.  It's a bit of a pain to attach, but not impossible and doesn't require tools.  This would be best on a stroller with 2 handles instead of a bar handrest.",3
"John Deere Fleece Blanket with Embroidered Satin Trim, Pink",Soft and totally girly with the John Deere flair but would rather not have paid double the price just for the label.,4
"Kolcraft Cozy Soft Cradle Pad, Lily",purchased this for our lil' ones craddle and am very happy with our purchase. it is exactly what I was looking for. love that it's a bit thicker than most pads and it is inexpensive. very happy with this purchase.,5

"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","We ordered this gate to keep two cats out of the bedroom while allowing the door to stay open for ventilation.  I have to say it exceeds my expectations.  It's sturdy, easy to install, easy to open and close and latches securely.  The cats haven't haven't even thought about getting past it.",5
Luvable Friends 2-Pack Waterproof &amp; Flat Quilted Multi-Use Pads,"This pad works in that it absorbs the liquid and protects what's underneath.  However, when my daughter had a tummy bug, the vomit collected in the quilting and it took about three washes to get the smell out, but I couldn't get the stain.  I did use spray on stain treater and colorsafe bleach with the detergent each time.  I won't be using quilted pads anymore.",3
"Gentle Naturals Tummy Soother, 4 oz.",This is the only thing that works when my son gets sick. They are crazy for discontinuing this product. There is nothing out there on the market that is natural and works like this does.  It just can't be replaced.,5
"Leachco Wrap Strap Anywhere Safety Strap, Red",This strap really works! It is wide so that the baby cannot get out of it. It really prevents her from standing up in the cart. It also works with regular chairs if you're at someones house to keep baby/toddler safe.,5
Constructive Eating 3 Piece Construction Worksite Utensil Set,"eeh, overpriced for quality. Bought as gag gift, not for use. Doesn't appear it would hold up well to childs use. Colors not as bright as anticipated.",3
Playtex Baby VentAire ADVANCED Standard Bottle 9 OZ - 3 Pack: Girl Colors,"This is my favorite bottle for many reasons: I love that it comes apart completely, so I know that it is very clean each time - opposed to traditional bottles that seem to have an impossible-to-remove film that gathers around the bottom of the bottle after time. Love that it is silent when my baby drinks from it because the air is being vented at the bottom of the bottle - opposed to the noisy bubbles and sputters from traditional nipple venting which is not ideal for babies going to sleep. Definitely reduces gas and air in my baby, which is awesome.Cons, as others have mentioned, they can leak when the bottom seal wears out, but you can buy replacement seals on the playtex website pretty cheap.  To me, it is worth the little extra work, even though I am a very busy mom.",4
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"I was pretty excited to get a video monitor was good ratings for such a good price, and it worked pretty well, but a few months in, the monitor went blank and after extensive investigation, I found a wire on the camera was split open like someone had sliced it with a knife. It was the weirdest thing, and very disappointing, and a waste of money. I guess I should have spent a couple hundred dollars and I would still have a monitor.",1
"My Brest Friend Original Pillow, Bluebells","I love this pillow.  My Brest friend allows me to breastfeed comfortably, and occasionally allows me to be hands free while nursing.  I also like that it straps on to my body so that I can stand up and sit down without needing to rearrange everything.",5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock n' Play Sleeper, Yellow",,5
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack, Lavender or Citrus","This product made no noticeable difference in our nursery. I also placed one on our cat litter box with the same result. As others have posted, there is no way to stick them anywhere, so you end up buying velcro stickers to put them around the house.",1
"Carters 5-Piece Girls Diaper Bag Set - brown/pink, one size","This set is so spacious and stylish. It matches easily to anything, and at the same time it isn't to girly for a man to handle either (My wife made me say it...) Very durable and good capacity, overall an awesome buy.Pros: Not to girly, Durable, Large capacity.Cons: Insulated bottle carrier isn't very insulated, nor is there much room for an ice pack.",5
Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Jumperoo,My baby loves this toy.... he loves the musical tunes.  It was easy to assemble and the instructions are very clear.,5
Vulli Products - Sophie The Giraffe Teething Ring - Gift Boxed! - 100% Natural rubber,"Well first, they didn't send the vanilla one and my baby hated the rubber taste. He doesn't really use it much even though he's teething. I wish I had gotten the traditional Sophie instead.",3
"Charlie Banana Reusable Feminine Pads Liner Butterfly, Butterfly","For the first time in my life, I decided to start using reusable pads. I honestly had no idea if I would like them, or if they would work. Well, I put them on, and they feel soft against my skin and are really cute! Only time will tell if they're as good as disposables, but right now, they're winning me over with the sheer comfort factor.",5

"Itzy Ritzy Peek-A-Boo Pod, Licorice Swirl","This is the third carseat cover we tried (fourth if you count throwing a blanket over the carseat), and we are finally happy!  Nothing interferes with holding the handle.  The elastic fits securely all the way around our carseat (Chicco Keyfit 30).  We can see baby while we're holding the carseat.  When we get the carseat in the car, we can quickly and easily take the pod off.  It's not bulky and easily fits in the diaper bag.",5

Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"My 4 1/2 month old loves this item (and so do I!)  It was easy to assemble, and baby loves the fact she is sitting up and exploring on her own.  She especially loves the animal sound buttons.  I highly recommend this item!  I am so glad I purchased it for her.  She is so happy!",5
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"I wouldn't have made it without this wonderful invention! At month 3, I put my son in it (with a blanket behind him to help his balance) and he LOVED it! At first he didn't know what anything did but within a month he had it all figured out. Because of this &quot;toy&quot; I was able to actually wash bottles and stuff while he played in it next to me! Now my son is 10 months and he still loves to walk around the outside of it and play. THIS THING WAS A GOD SEND! THANKS EVENFLO!!!!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My almost 6 yr old son got this when he was 1 or 2 and it is still working great.  We've replaced the batteries a few times, but since getting it, he started staying in his room easier and still  turns it on if he wakes up in the middle of the night.  My younger son is not as enthralled by the turtle (they each have one), but does like it.  He has never been as concerned about being in his room alone or in the dark like my first son. Great product.",5
"Disney Care Center Play Yard, Alice In Wonderland",I love the pack n play however besides the theme the only other reason I bought this one over others was for the extra storage..the storage just kind of hangs there there's no support and just looks sloppy if you actually put anything in it.,3

"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Galaxy Grey",So glad I bought this! Very good quality and much more comfortable than my Moby wrap I was using. It is pricey but I feel that it was well worth it.,5
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman","The assembly time was probably about 20 minutes, it wasn't very difficult to put together. It also has two levels in addition to the napper and the changer. It really sturdy and durable because my 3 year old sometimes climbs on the side of it. The material is vinal so it's easy to wash. The only thing is that my daughter is growing quickly out of the napper/changer. She is three months and will probably use that portion until about 4 1/2 months then I will have to see if I can detach it.",5
"Fisher-Price Cradle n Swing, My Little Lamb","We really love this swing. My son prefers the cradle shape to the bucket up right seat. He naps and plays in it. He loves the mirror on the underside of the mobile. The three positions is nice and we definitely use this feature. There are a lot of song options too. Amazon sold this for the best price especially with super saver shipping. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars the music automatically stops way too soon. Our soon would wake up and start crying as soon as it would stop. My only regret is that we didn't buy this sooner, like before he was born.",4
Boon Dive Bath Tub Appliques,These foamy tub toys are great. My 10 month old daughter loved them as soon as they came out of the box. She figured out how to put them on the wall or the tub itself and she likes to put them inside other containers in the bath. They are easy to play with and they don't have any chemical smells to them.,5
Bugaboo Cameleon Adapter for Select Maxi-Cosi Car Seats,"Okay!  So admittedly, I rushed into using this adapter before understanding how the car seat worked.  We have the Maxi Cosi AP and it fits fine.  However, there is a separate set of button that release the car seat.  It is not the same release mechanism as getting the car seat out of the base.  There are two buttons (right in front of your face) that will release the car seat.",5
"Munchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Vary","My baby LOVES this thing!!Bananas happen to be her favorite so far and I found an easy non-toxic way to clean it. First, I rinse the larger pieces of banana out of the mesh. Then I pour a little bit of 3% hydrogen peroxide (stuff you buy in the first aid section) into a cup, just enough so I can fully submerge the mesh part in. Then I add a tablespoon or two of baking soda, stir, and let set for about 15 minutes. I stir the mesh thing around occasionally while it's setting because the baking soda likes to collect at the bottom of the cup. Once it's done setting, I pull it out and give it one more quick 15 second rinse under the sink and it's clean!!",5
Eddie Bauer Car Seat Protector,These work great in my car since I have leather seats it helps to Protect the seat from food spills,5
Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Latex Nipple - Slow Flow - 2 Pack,"My 7 week old daughter is breastfed exclusively and I haven't been able to get her to take a bottle at all. I even went so far as to spend $10 on a single bottle (Avent) and it didn't work. These nipples work! I'm not sure if its just the latex nipple or the whole playtex drop in bottle system.. but its working.. (occasionally), so I'm not changing anything. :)Of course, she is stubborn and will only take this nipple from me if she happens to be in the right mood and will only take it from Gramma if she has cried long enough to be absolutely sure I'm not there.. but at least it is clear that she knows what to do with it, so she won't starve if I leave her with Gramma.. Though she might if I left her with her daddy. She won't take it from him at all. Still, one step at a time.. I'm glad that we have at least found a bottle she is willing to try on occasion. If she is really hungry and the person giving it to her is patient enough, she will drink the whole bottle. :)PS. I didn't buy mine online because of reviews that recommended buying them from the store since they aren't the same when you order online, so I can't comment on the quality of the product if bought online. I found mine (nipples, nurser, and breast milk storage set) at Target and they were in perfect condition and work wonderfully.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I got these for my son and I must say, I really loved them.  They are kinda of a pain at first with all the pieces but they are worth it and eventually the pieces don't become a hassle :)  If you can do bottle liners all the time you can handle these!",5
Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobile,"We have a co-sleeper in our bedroom, so we can't use this to help our son fall asleep there.  But after discovering he was very entrained by it during the day, we tried it last night in his future crib in his nursery and he was entertained for over an hour before falling asleep.  Then I was able to move him asleep into our co-sleeper.  Not a horrible solution, but it would be nice if they had other versions of this that could fit on the Arms Reach co-sleepers.  We will keep using it and would buy again in a heat beat, because he loves it!",5
Baby's My First Photo Album of Family &amp; Friends,"This is a great item for a baby far from grandparents. I am close to mine, but everytime we look at the book, I believe it make the family members a familiar sight! I also added photos of  common animals and pets to mine. Definitely a winner!!",5
Graco 3-in-1 Potty Trainer,"We bought this because our 4.5 year old son wouldn't poop on the potty. It has helped tremendously and he is finally going.  The seat is made out of a Croc shoe-like material or a Bumbo seat.You are able to easily take out the grey potty part and it easily fits on the seat of the toilet.  I like this feature-it has made it easier for our son to transition from the little seat on the floor to the toilet without being worried about the cavernous toilet bowl below him (I think that is what his hang-up was about pooping in it). Being able to take it apart has been good, but for a younger child it would be a problem.  It sort of slides apart easily (doesn't latch in or anything) and would probably be tricky for a newby at potty training.",3

The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Raw Olive &amp; Baroque - Certifed Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch,"Loved this!

I would recommend this to everyone",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,Bought this for my baby granddaughter's recent visit.  My daughter is so happy with it that she wants to take it home with her!  Nice size.

"Kick Mats - Extra Large Auto Seat Back Protector in Black, 2-pack - The Best Solution to Safeguard Your Car Seats From Dirt Marks and Stains Caused By Kicks and Spills - Effective and Affordable - 90 Day Risk-free Money-back Guarantee","This fits our Honda Odyssey 2012 perfectly.  The top and the bottom straps both have buckles, similar to those that you will find on a hiking back pack.  No elastics!  I couldn't find any photos of the bottom strap and didn't know where the buckle was located but purchased anyways and am glad I did.  The bottom buckle is 4-5 inches from the sewn location to the panel so you won't be sitting on it.  The bottom strap can be tucked into the seat cushion where the back meets the bottom and you can't even tell it is there (visible yes, feel no) (don't tighten it all the way, leave it a little loose on the bottom).  I will probably buy it again as a gift for one of my siblings in the near future.We do a lot of hiking and my two kids (3 & 6) use the back of the seat to push them up into their car seats and this will work like a charm to protect the seat.The only change I would make would be to reduce the distance between the sewn locations on the top strap a little so (only occurs when the distance between the headrest poles is shorter than the distance between the sewn locations) no scrunching of the panel occurs. Not a big deal but it has a little riffle.  Another minor change would be to add a stiffener rod (semi-flexible) to the top lip of the panel so that the corners won't droop (no other manufacturers have these either)  They are not drooping now, even in 90 degree heat, so maybe not needed.  The great part is that the vendor contacted me and thanked me for the input and will consider the ideas.  So far great product and no issues.  Even if something happens in the future, it's an easy fix to sew back on because they are straps and not elastics.",5
"Lansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads, 60-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)","I highly recommend these pads! I have breastfeed 3 children and have tried many different brands and this is by far, the most comfortable. Playtex is very soft and comfortable, but they are too thick. Middle is soft but outer rim is scratchy and can irritate sensitive nipples. If the pads were too thick, they would make me feel sweaty and unclean. Its important to me that my pads are thin and breathable for hygiene purposes.Lansinoh pads are thin and super absorbent. 2 stickers that help keep them from bunching and in place. In my experience, if they are not sticking well or slipping around in your bra, it may be the type of material your bra is and not the pad. I learned this the hard way years back. Now I try to always buy thin cotton nursing bras.",5

"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","I bought those bottles, and though they require some extra work as far as the cleaning and the assembling is concerned, they were very good with gas!Yes, they sometimes leak, but so does every bottle on the market,believe me, I tried them all, particularly Avent!I don't know if you can do something for your gassy baby, but I definitely don't understand all this hype about Avent bottles, for instance. They seem, as my mom put it, as any regular bottle, they don't seem to filter the gas at all.It might be that my baby is less gassy than others and I am blessed ( but I wake every two hours to feed my baby girl, so there, you have it!)but at least they attempt to, because they look more different than others.Playtex weren't bad either, but Avent, come on?! Just regular ""European"" bottles! I come from Europe, so try harder to impress me!The Dr. Brown's bottles are very easy to hold, esp. during the night, they are good with gas, or at least attempt to, nicely built and leak less than other! The shape of the nipple is the one that ressemble the most, I would say, to the shape of the breast nipple! Only by buying them, you can decide if they work for you or not!But it worked for us, it seems logical for the babies to be less gassy since these bottles come with a filter for air!!!Amy Leea",5

Sassy Pop n' Push Car,"We bought this car for my 6 month old daughter for Christmas.  The first car we purchased didn't work when we pulled it back and let it go.  However, she loved the size, color and popping balls so much (and we liked the price) that we exchanged it for a new one.  The exchange was quick and easy at no cost to us.  The new car works great.  I can tell that this is going to be a toy that she will continue to grow into as well.",4

15 Plastic Alligator Grip Suspender Pacifier Binky Mitten Bib Toy Holder Clips 10 - Tested Free of Harmful Chemicals (Variety Color Pack),These are AWESOME! Received them quickly. Great for making pacifier holders to match every outfit. Really affordable. So much cuter than just plain suspender clips.,5
Gerber NUK Orthodontic 10-oz. Bottles - 3-pk Colors MAY Vary,"The Gerber Nuk Orthodontic bottles are cute, and overall well designed. Initially, the nipples on the bottle may be difficult to figure out which way to put in your baby's mouth. We quickly learned that the hole in the nipple should be on the roof of the baby's mouth (if you see the vent hole pointing up towards your baby's nose, you got the nipple hole in the correct direction). The bottles are easy to clean, and are shaped short and wide, thus allowing our daughter to easily hold it by herself with both hands without tipping over.My one gripe with the bottle is that because the nipple hold placement is on the side of a nipple as opposed to directly on the top, if you shake the bottle with formula in it, the formula leak out, even with the cap on! We learned this the hard way when absent mindedly tossing a full bottle into a backpack, and it tipped over sideways! If you're conscientious about keeping your bottles upright, you wont have a problem. Also, you will need to either use your finger to block the hole when mixing formula, or use a spoon. Most people will most likely overlook this one inconvenience, as having an easier time feeding your baby trumps over all.The 5-ounce bottle set comes with the slow flow nipples. The 8-ounce bottles come with medium flow nipples. For those who think these bottles are too expensive, often Gerber sends out coupons that include $3 off any Nuk Bottle. At Target, these bottles are generally priced around $5 per bottle for either the 5- or 8-ounce size.  The fast flow nipples are sold separately.Outside of the bottle cap leaking problem, I would recommended this bottle to my new mommy friends! Recommended!",4

"Carter's First Year Calendar, Laguna","This calendar is printed on high-quality paper and comes in a thick plastic protective sleeve, which will definitely be handy for storage. The stickers allow you to customize the calendar based on birth date and there are also some for milestones. Especially nice are the sections at the front to talk about mommy and daddy's history and the family tree, as well as a page dedicated to the day the baby was born. Each month has the same fill-in questions (I believe another reviewer wrote them out), and a place for a photo. What I like best, besides the quality, is the super-cute, timeless, unisex pattern of jungle animals, which is subtly woven throughout. It's just an adorable keepsake that is easy for those of us who really wish we'd do a more detailed baby book but just don't have time. You will be so glad after a year that you used one of these calendars, and this one is excellent and very affordable. I will be buying this for others as a shower gift.",5

"Carters Easy Fit Sateen Crib Fitted Sheet, Ecru","These sheets look nice, feel soft, have a nice color, fit well and hold up to a lot of washes.  I've never had issues with holes, tearing and/or fading.  I still use my 3 years olds on his toddler bed and bought the same ones for his new baby brother.  Well worth the price.  Would and will buy again.",5
Bright Starts Having a Ball Pop and Roll Roadster,"I have a one year old, and I have not had serious problems. I actually really like the product, we got the opportunity to test it out, and all in all it is pretty good. He really loves cars so this was a really great product, it is easy for him to understand, it moves around easy unlike other ride-on's; the sounds and buttons are also a cute addition. My main problem was the hood, it was all easy to assemble however the hood was constantly falling off, I have had it only a week and I already lost the hood. That isn't really a big deal however and overall I would recommend this product.",4
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"Finally!  I have been searching for a sippy cup my picky almost-10 month old will actually use.  This is it!  My daughter is breastfeeding and hasn't had much experience with a bottle.  When she does get a bottle, unless she's very hungry she just played with the nipple.  So we tried, on our doctor's advice, to transition to sippy cups when we wanted to introduce water.  I tried several brands including, Avent and Tommee Tippee, and she could either get the sucking or the tipping of the cup but not both at the same time.  This allows her to just focus on sucking and not worry about tipping the cup!Features:* The straw is fabulous with a weight at the bottom.  No matter what way she gets the it to her mouth she gets liquid (unless the cup is empty).  As with any straw sippy you need to be careful how you clean this.  I found the cleaning brush to be helpful.  This area is my biggest concern though since I don't want to breed bacteria.* There's a flip lid to keep the straw clean when traveling, etc.  One minor drawback here is that it doesn't click open very well so often my daughter accidentally closes it and I have to open it back up.  Might not be an issue with an older baby.* Good size, weight, and nice handles.  The cup is very easy for my daughter to manage including when it is full.  Many sippy cups are just to heavy with liquid for a 10 month old.The other drawback that I've found to this cup is that it CAN leak.  The packaging says this so it's not a surprise.  The design just doesn't allow for a complete seal.  However, if you put the lid on properly and watch that your child doesn't leave it on it's side for a long time this is not really a big issue.All-in-all I love this sippy.  So much so that the others have been put away in the cupboard (until she learns to suck and tip simultaneously) and I've just ordered another Zoli!",4
Safety 1st Sleepy Baby Nail Clipper,"Is there a scarier mundane task than clipping a newborn's nails?  Yikes!  While it is always a hairy proposition, this clipper works great.  The little light highlighting the nails is a Godsend!  The crescent clipper area is very small, too -- perfect for teeny hands and feet.",5
"Gerber Plastic Pants, 18 Months, Fits 24-28 lbs. (4 pairs)","We used these covers for potty training over training underwear and they've been fantastic. They are sturdier than the Baby R Us version.  Haven't had to replace them yet, can't say the same about the BRU version! Loving Gerber.",5
"Inglesina 2011 Fast Table Chair, Marina","Only problem: if you have a skirt on your table it is difficult to use.  You have to untwist it all the way and hope it will fit. Then hope there's enough leg room.This works best on tables without a skirt.  It is PERFECT for our picnic table.  It is very sturdy, great colors, comfortable, and just super easy on the road!",4
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange","Decided to get this stroller over the regular city mini, because we wanted durable, all-terrian wheels that will last and not wear down since this stoller holds up to sixty pounds. (Plus we hope to use it until our son is 3 or 4 years old) It is also not as bulky or expensive as the City Mini Elite.Other pros:-easy to fold up-easy hand break-Huge multifold sun shade, plus rear roll up cover that also both good for rain.Cons:- a little heavy, not easy to carry up stairs, even when folded.- storage bin is shallow, difficult to get large items in there, such as a diaper bag- can tip if you hang a heavy bag from handle (it says not to hang stuff on the handle, but I do sometimes now that my son is heavier)",4
"Nuby Bug A Loop Teether Bead, Colors May Vary","My baby loves this toy. She started playing with it at 6 months or so when she began to really hold things and teethe on them, and at 14 months she still enjoys holding it, chewing on it, and dropping it. It's durable and has lots of fun colors and textures. I would definitely recommend this toy.",5
Munchkin 36 Count Plug Covers,This pack was inexpensive and was plenty enough to cover the outlets I needed with a few left over. Rounded so little hands can't get a good grip but fairly easy for an adult to remove baca use they have a tiny slit in the top. Nice to feel more secure without fighting to plug in the toaster.,5
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump - Carry All,"Great pump and so easy to use!  A friend recommended this instead of the Medela set and I'm very happy with my decision.  When I was in the hospital, I used the Medela pump and just found that there were a lot of pieces to put together and take apart each time.  There is very little disassembly with this pump, which makes it so much faster to get started.  I would highly recommend this!",5

"Contours Options 3 Wheel Stroller, Berkley","I love it, it looks expensive  and have the same features of any other expensive brand name  . it is really affordable, perfect for long walks, my little girl loves to be looking at me when we walking .  a little heavier and big for my sizes ( I'm really petite 95 lb and 4.8 ), it is definitely not the perfect stroller for traveling , it will take a lot space on your trunk.

Lotus Travel Crib and Portable Baby Playard,"The crib itself is wonderful.  It sets up and breaks down in a snap.  The Lotus cotton fitted sheet, on the other hand, is a hassle.  It is apparently too tight for the mattress so it cannot fit without the mattress folding up.  Looping the Velcro tabs through the sheet holes and attaching said tabs to the bottom of the crib takes 5x as long as actually setting up the crib - pretty much any time saved is lost just because of an ill-fitting sheet.  However, I would still buy this crib if I had to do it all over again.",5
"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large","Love this little guy, such a cute toy. This was a gift for my 2 year old granddaughter. She really enjoyed riding on it, it was the perfect size for her little legs. I would recommended this item.",5
Summer Infant Secure Sight Digital Color Video Monitor,"Some of the other reviews made me hesitant to order this monitor, but I'm so glad I bought it.  We've been using this about two months and love it!  When expecting our second child we decided to buy a second video monitor (the monitor for our first child is also Summer Infant Video Monitor - we've had it almost two years and love it as well).  The handheld unit is the perfect size, has excellent picture and we love the rechargeable battery.  It's made it extremely easy to both watch and hear our daughter.  We had no complaints at all about this product and highly recommend it.",5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I started sleeping better my first night with this body pillow. Before I had anywhere from 3 to 4 pillows taking up a lot of room on our queen size bed. Now I use this plus one other pillow I use for under my preggo tummy - I sleep with the ""spine"" of the pillow along the back of my body - always. It doesn't work well for me when it's in the front. I saved the box it came in so when we travel I can take it with me. It may seem a little excessive, but hey, a good nights sleep is worth lugging around a pillow whether it's in the car or on the plane.",5
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator Crystal | #1 Tested Snot Sucker,"This is a great tool, and much better (more effective) than the simple bulb suckers they give you in the hospital. The opening is fairly large, so it probably would not be great for newborns, but works very well on our 4 month old. The only drawbacks I would say is that it doesn't go quite as far into his nose, so we have to position it exactly right to be able to suck everything out. Also, the little hose attachment is removable- this is great for cleaning, but not so great with a smart baby who figures out that he can make this unpleasantness stop by pulling on the tube which pulls it off of the mouthpiece. It's pretty much a two-person job to hold the baby's head/arms while another person sucks, but boy it works when you get everything positioned correctly.",4
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,This is a must have for parents who have formula babies.  It makes mixing bottles efficient and there are no clumps!  The mixer itself is a breeze to clean and is sturdy.,5
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","Really an excellent product. It has an insert for the seat, which means it'll fit a young one (2-4 months) and then when they get older, you pull out the insert and it'll be usable for several more months. I love that the table turns so you can bring whatever you want to the attention of your child. There is room to add more toys as well as food/drink. You can see it here [...]if interested. (The video is mainly to show the spinning wheel toy, but you can see the seat, table and toys too.)",5

Especially for Baby Under the Sea Turtle Sponge,"Taking a closer look at it once it was received , which came well with in the specified time frame and at no additional cost either i might add ;) the foam seems awfully soft and a bit thinner than in the picture but none the less should do it's prescribed job just fine ! This was inside a sealed bag with a Baby's R Us logo on it , so i'm guessing they're the usual retailer / manufacturer of it . If that matters or makes a difference to any of you reading this . It's also available in several other colors and patterns but this one suited our grandson , he seems to like turtles and he is a lil' boy so blue is fitting , obviously . The scalloped form with in the sponge should help keep him steady during bath time just fine and as intended . $15.00 well spent I think and will cut down on our laundry costs since we're not using 3-4 towels to form a makeshift cradle for him during bath time , SCORE !",4
Sassy Crib and Floor Mirror,"My 13 week old loves this toy! It was the first toy she started playing with. Around 8 weeks she loved looking at herself in the mirror. Now, she is reaching out to touch the bugs and has figured out how to spin the black and white ball in the ladybug. We set it in her pack-n-play and when we have to change her she is so captivated by this toy she doesn't notice she is being changed.My only problem with this toy is it tips over so easy. It is not sturdy on its base whatsoever! It is constantly falling over when she is playing with it. I really wish it had a flat, sturdy base and then it would be a five star toy.",4

"Luvable Friends Infant Pillow Case, Traditional Blue Print","This pillow case  is just as advertised, it's very soft.  I use it for my hourglass shaped pillow that I sleep with between my knees.

Fisher-Price Precious Planet Melodies and Motion Soother,"This soother is so pretty.  I used it both for my son and daughter.  Happy animals, soft sounds, adjustable volume. When my son was several months old, he figured out how to activate it himself.  It's great, he would wake up in the middle of the night and I could hear that he turned it on.  Helped him sleep.  Even took it on vacations.",5
"Munchkin High Capacity Drying Rack, White","I had the First years spinning drying rack and thought that was great, but WOW does this one take the cake!I love the fact the spokes do not come off, they fold down. BIG plus for me.Its very sturdy, and less flimsy than the first years one too. I had to use a piece of electrical tape on the middle post on the first years one so it was thicker so the top rack didnt slide down, but that was no biggie to me and it got a lot of use thats for sure.So i came on here a while back looking to get another, as i just had another baby so i needed a new rack for his bottles and breast pump parts, and i would use the other one for my 2 year old's sippy cup parts and stuff.Well when i opened this one and set it up i fell in love with it, tossed the first years one and ordered another of these!I have them both sitting on my counter next to each other and could NOT be happier. I put up pictures, if you want to see.Holds a TON of weight, i have 4 to 5 breast pump funnels on the top at a time, along with the diaphragms, duck bills, breast cushions, bottles. Then on the bottom i put more bottles, nipples, collars, you name it. If i wash it for the baby it goes in there and it does its job perfectly!I HIGHLY recommend this drying rack. You will NOT be disappointed!!!",5
bumGenius One-Size Snap Closure Cloth Diaper 4.0 - Bubble,"I don't have experience with the previous model but I do like this one a lot. Never had a blowout with them, easy clean-up with the diaper sprayer, usually no stains left after I wash, if there are any left, dry in the sun, you will be amazed how all stains will disappear. Multiple washes will also remove stains. Never tried other brands of cloth diapers because I was so happy with these.",5

"P'Kolino Little Sofa Lounge, Red","I ordered the P'Kolino sofa-sleeper for my 2 year old grandchild. It's the perfect size for her (is great for 1-3+ ages). When I ordered I found that it was quite the popular item and was on backorder. I had to wait quite awhile, but it definitely was worth the wait. Babycakes of Scottsdale was just great about keeping me abreast of the sofa availability, and the minute it was available it was shipped. I will definitely order other items from Babycakes through Amazon Marketplace again. This sofa is just great for your toddler to sit and look at or read books, and in the sleeper position is awesome for a little sleepy one. Thanks Amazon and Babycakes of Scottsdale!",5
Sassy Pop n' Push Car,"Smaller than I thought...didn't look at measurements but it is really cute, my 18 month old loves it and it turns out to be a good size for her anyway.",5
"The First Years 4 Pack Ziploc Sippy Cup, 10 Ounce","I usually use the take and toss cups and have never had a problem aside from possibly having a small drip from the spout after hours of it sitting upside down.  These leak everywhere through the twist on part.  My son complained about one of them not working and after checking it out I actually had to re-poke holes in the spout with a safety pin because they weren't done correctly.  Definitely not cheap enough for all of these issues, they are going into the recycle bin..even the ones we haven't used yet.",1
Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobile,"This mobile is excellent. My baby likes it very much (toys and music) and I can leave the baby lying in bad and looking at mobile for 30min and more and do other things at that time without worrying. Great, great! I would recommend such toys to all my friends with babies.",5
"Thirsties Duo Diaper Snap, Mud, Size One (6-18 lbs)",I love these diapers!  Cute colors and prints.  Plus they are very functional.  Love the gussets.  They keep breast fed poop very well contained! They don't fit my chunky baby as well as BumGenius 4.0 though,5
New Mommy Advice Cards -24ct- Party Supplies,These cards were placed on the tables during my baby shower. It was a great side item that people could share their advice with me. I collected them at the end and have placed them in my keepsake box. The people attending my baby shower comented on how nice the idea was.,5
"OXO Tot Flip-In Hamper, Gray/Green","Just like all OXO designs this looks great, clean and modern and works perfectly for baby's dirty clothes. The lid is easy to lift or refit  with one hand and the colors are stylish--just as pictured.",5
myBaby SoundSpa Portable,"Me and baby have a bedtime routine of bath, than pjs, than rocking and listening to the sound machine.  She loves it.",5
Snuza Halo Mobile Baby Movement Monitor,"This was featured on """"The Doctor's"""" and I did not hesitate to purchase this for my 4 month old granddaughter that very day. What peace of mind-knowing that when you sleep your baby is protected. It's like having insurance. Easy to use and the baby does not even know its there. What a great invention! Thank you!",5
Munchie Mug - Top Rated Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Ages 1 to 4 years. Made in AMERICA. - BPA and phthalate free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top,"This is the best snack cup.  I love that it has a cover that you can screw on instead of the trap top to keep things fresh and keep bugs out.  But the trap is the best part.  My son can spill anything out of the others because he likes to hold them from the top and turn them over.  But with this one, since the trap is further down, he can't hold the trap open with one hand and spill everything out by turning it over.  It's a lot bigger than others too, so you can put a good amount in there.  Our son was scared to put his hand in at first because he couldn't see inside very well, but he learned to love it and carries it around all the time now.  This is one of the best buys we've made.",5
"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","I ordered the Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag in Pewter because I finally realized that with a toddler I needed a bigger bag than my regular purse. I wish I'd invested in it earlier in my son's life but better late than never! Originally, I thought all those pockets were over-kill but after using them I've discovered how handy they are. My son'sDabbawalla Lunch Bag, Out of this Worldlunch bag fits easily inside the main compartment with room for a coat and an extra toy in addition to what I normally lug around. I would easily suggest this bag to someone looking for a diaper bag or a cute laptop bag (my 15"" MacBook Pro fits but it's close).Orgainizing:All the pockets make it easy to organize my son's items and my things; finding a specific item is quick and painless. One of the inside pockets houses my purse, another is a perfect fit for myKindle Paperwhite, 6"" High Resolution Display with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers, sunglasses for both me and my son along with sun screen and a hat are housed in a third inner pocket. The inner zipper pocket is my ""medicine drawer"" holding a few different pills, etc. The front top zipper pocket is perfect for my cell phone, a pen, and lipstick. While the bottom zipper pocket holds six different types of toy cars. The back pocket with the zipper has some sort of antimicrobial lining called ""agion"" which, I presume is for hauling around dirty diapers. Instead, I use it as the pocket I store emergency snacks for my boy. The two outside insulated drink pockets work very well, at least better than I expected, at keeping the drinks warm/cool.Cons:The bag is HUGE! My friends laugh the first time they see it and call it my duffle bag. Personally, I think they're just jealous. :) But since it is so light-weight (1.8 pounds) it is not a back-killer. If only it came with a shoulder strap it would be perfect. However, it will be easy enough to snag one from a different purse and attach to the Studio Diaper Bag using the stroller strap hooks.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 4 month old son is teething, and I've tried all kinds of teethers, but none seem to satisfy him. So, when I read the reviews for Sophie, I figured all these people couldn't be wrong. When I first got her, I was glad that Sophie is not hard, inflexible rubber, which she looks like from the picture. She is much softer, like the rubbery consistency of a dog toy, which some people have already commented on. My thoughts regarding Sophie's likeness to a dog toy is not a far-fetched comparison; this is especially so with the way the squeaker sounds. Our dog LOVES this thing! I have to hide it, but he goes sniffing for it. Anyway, when our son first got his hands on this thing, it went straight into his mouth. And he smiles every time Sophie squeaks, which is so cute to see. He also smiles when he ""gums"" Sophie's body, especially her legs (hooves, actually). So, judging from the way my son puts it in his mouth, and smiles when he does so, I'd say she was a worthwhile purchase, but it is very pricey, nonetheless, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It's handmade, made of natural rubber (from the sap of the Havea tree), hand-painted with food grade colors, and the finished product takes 14 steps to complete. It's been around since 1961 (or 65, I can't remember)and hasn't changed since. But even though she'll be a keepsake, the price is exaggerated. If you want a teether that works, however, Sophie is worth it.",4
Samsung Ezview Baby Monitor,"We received this as a gift. Thank goodness we didn't spend money on it. It works and we can clearly see our son and hear him as well. No issues with range. The problems, power cords have got a short in them now so they need to be adjusted every time. The unit has only been used for 7 months. Secondly, the damn noise alarm feature...why Samsung? Why not have a turn off setting. Vibrate and Beep only...plus the lowest setting on vibrate is comparable to a 2.5 on the Richter scale.",2
"Gund Baby Lena Lamb Musical Toy, Jesus Loves Me","My preference would be 2 1/12 stars..5 stars for cuteness of the lamb, but 0 stars for durability...yes, it said be careful not to overwind, and I WAS careful about that but the music mechanism still broke the EXACT same day that my niece received this as a present..products for childrens should be DURABLE...",3
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,Overall good. I like the screws to secure it in place. Big dogs tend to break out still. That's the only down size.,4
"JL Childress 4 'N 1 Car Seat Travel System, Black","The bag material is really thick and sturdy.  The strap is nice.  Unfortunately, it broke the first time I used it!  I was flying alone with my son and on our return trip the zipper broke at the airport.  When we got home, my husband was able to fix it but we're not sure if the design of the zipper will hold up in the long term.  Otherwise, we like it.",3
"Stork Craft Venetian 4-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, Cherry",This crib is beautiful.  When compared to much higher priced furniture it looks just as good for half the price. I wasnt sure what to expect and was pleasantly suprised.  All the pieces came with it and no trouble to assemble. My husband and I (mostly my husband) put it together in under an hour. I would definitely recommend this set.,5
Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer MODEL# TAT-2000C,"We have used this for a few months now. We have found it reliable for picking up significant fevers. For this it is fast, simple, and nearly perfect for small children.However, the results are not consistent enough to identify low grade fevers. Our doctor recommended monitoring one child as a chronic moderate fever might indicate a problem he about which he was concerned. This thermometer didn't seem to work for that.I'm glad we have it. But it's not quite what we had hoped for.",3
"Redmon For Kids, Kids Folding Camp Chair, Red",I ordered this chair for my 18 month old grandson.  He has a little trouble getting in and out of it but that should get better as he gets bigger.  Like the cup holder. It locks so it will not collapse on him.,5
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,"This changing table pad is much better than the one that came with the changing table.  Fits perfectly. Waterproof, easy to wipe clean.",5
"Sassy Developmental Bath Toy, Catch and Count Net","This is a great little set.  My LO loves the 3 fish and still plays with them after many months.  Note: The net itself is lightweight and hollow with small holes along the black and white striped ring - I suspect the purpose is to drain any water that might get caught in the handle.  My daughter seems to enjoy sucking the water out of the holes, so we had to take it away from her.  Otherwise, good bath time fun.  :)",4
"Lambs and Ivy Enchanted Forest Decorative Pillow, Tan/Brown/Green",This pillow is so cute and so soft.  It compliments the other Lambs and Ivy products I have purchased for my grandson.  Quality is excellent!,5
"Dream On Me 2 in 1 Bassinet to Cradle, Blue",I would have returned this but ran out of time - for only about $55 it wasn't too terrible but the wheels do not roll together and you cannot take the fabric off to wash it. I would not recommend this unless you can't afford anything else.,1
"Clek Ozzi Portable Booster Car Seat, Licorice","simple nice seat but does not fit so back to amazon it went.  pretty basic seat, no cupholders though.  decided to just convert my 5 year old's britax booster into a backless booseter instead- since the latch belts are not adjustable on the clek it makes it not able to move so you can position it just so so you can buckle child in.  Britax booster has floppy belts for the latch so you can move it to either side when installing.",4
3&frac12;&times;5 &quot;Granddaughter&quot; w/Teddy Bear and Baby Carraige,"The party I sent the gift to seemed pleased and thanked me. I liked how it looked very much and was glad I had purchased the picture frame. Also, it arrived in good time as posted.",5
"Prince Lionheart BoosterPOD, White Base/Lemon","We bought this booster for our 2.5 year old daughter.  We're very happy with the purchase and she liked not having to sit on her knees when at the table.  WRT to the issues others have noted, the booster fits under the side of our table and we have a pretty standard size dining room table.  Also, to note we don't use the seatbelt and haven't been concerned about it being difficult to clean.  If they get gross, we might just remove them altogether.  The rest of the booster cleans up just fine.",5
"Safety 1st Grip N' Twist Door Knob Cover, 4-Count","We actually purchased these by accident, based on an inaccurate product photo of the kind of doorknob covers we actually wanted to purchase. Once we found out that they no longer carried the ones we really wanted, we decided to give these a try. Not only are they difficult for my 6-year-old to operate with her small hands, my 2-year-old son can remove them from the knobs with very little effort. The two halves snap together over the doorknob, and can be removed by squeezing them together at the right point (or as my son figured out, by hitting it repeatedly with a heavy toy). I certainly wouldn't depend on these to keep little ones out of unsafe areas.",2
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Quarter Moon","I bought the quarter moon night light for my 4  year old daughter for Christmas 2010. We have a turtle light from another company, but my 4 year old and 2 year old daughters always fight over who gets to sleep with the moon.The light has always worked great, but I noticed around April 2011 it would only charge if something heavy was put on top of the light as it wasn't making a connection with the base when placed on the charger. I contacted the company, Blue Moon Lights, and received an immediate response with some trouble shooting tips. I responded back and the representative (I think it was one of the owners of the company) responded multiple times. He offered to replace the moon at no charge. I let him know my kids fight over who gets to sleep with the moon every night and let him know we alternate with another light up product. He proceeded to ask me if my kids were 2 boys or 2 girls (I told him girls) and he said he included something in the replacement package that would help with our nightly battles and emailed me the tracking number. When I received the package, I was shocked to see the elephant light in addition to the replacement moon. In his previous email, he even gave me a discount code if I ever wanted to purchase another product from the company in the future. My kids were excited as well, but now we have nightly fights over who gets to sleep with the elephant :)Hands down, this is one of the best customer service experiences I have ever received. I'm so happy to see that there are still companies that see the value in customer service and I will be recommending them to all my friends with kids!",5

"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Small, Circle Bear","I'm a father of two, one is currently swaddled in this.  She sleeps in this.  No crying!  Buy a few as your wife will want to wash it when the infant spits, throws up, etc..",5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Wearable Blanket Applique, Elephant, Small","The baby uses this and I love tucking him into it. The cotton is soft and had held up well after many washes. It is just heavy enough for a well heated room, light enough for summer. If you keep the temperature low in winter, you might want something heavier. All in all, I would suggest buying two so you have once in case there is an accident, if you know what I mean.",5
"Swaddlebees Newborn Simplex All In One Diapers, Giraffe","These diapers are great!  My husband and I fell in love with these diapers when we went from using disposables to using them.  The prints and colors are perfect for babies outfits too.  Now that our little girl is almost 7 weeks old and 12 pounds, we are still using them.  However, she is sleeping through the night as well as wetting pretty heavy, so we use a disposable diaper at night time (only have done this for a few days).  If I wanted to buy additional inserts and use those, we could, but I just needed to use the disposable diapers we already had. We are going to be using size ones as well with our little girl.  We purchased 13 mostly gender neutral colors/prints so that we can use them with our second baby as well...amazing how much money you will save not buying disposable diapers.The simplex diapers work great for us!  I couldn't be more happy with our purchase.Suggestions:Purchase more than we did (13) because you will go through more than that in one day at times...I'd suggest 15 at the minimum if you wash every dayPurchase a wet/dry bag so that you can temporarily keep your diapers together for the wash later (you can use it while traveling as well)Purchase a diaper sprayer for your toilet to rinse off poop",5
"Gerber Waterproof Pant, 2 Pack, White, 12 Months","GERBER MAKES REALLY GOOD BABY PANTS TO USE WITH CLOTH DIAPERS. I WILL ALWAYS USE THEM. THEY WILL NOT LEAK, EVEN FOR OVERNIGHT USE.",5
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"This monitor was highly recommended to us... unfortunately it has given us nothing but grief.Regardless of what channel or volume it is set to we constantly pick up a high pitched static feedback.  There are only 2 channels to choose from on this unit, one of which picks up the static worse than the other.  Unfortunately the less static filled channel also picks up a neighbors signal (and they have a constant crying baby, ugh!!!) so a lot of times I will check on our daughter to find she is fast asleep while the mystery baby is bawling its head out via our monitor.  In order for me to sleep at night, we have to run our fan to create enough white noise to drown out the static.Going to shop around for another system...",1
Replacement Tubing (Retail Pack of 2) for Medela Pump in Style and New Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump - 100% BPA FREE,My tube got mold after a while so I order this replacement. I can't complain. It does the job for me and the price is just right.,5

Fully charged. Did not have to spend 100 dollars for new monitor. Really strong battery better then original battery.,5
BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Bassinet,"I have no complaints about this product at all. It works exactly as expected (although it could be a little cushier). I didn't expect to be able to use this past 4-5 months of age, so that was not a negative for me. I love the portability! Fantastic to keep in the car for impromptu naps while visiting friends or family. It's also great for allowing your little one to sleep comfortably on a church pew. Just knowing I have a safe, clean, contained space for the little one to sleep when away from home makes it worth every penny to me!",5
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"I ordered the 21mm breast shields & it says 21mm on them, but I measured them to the ones I already have (standard 24mm) & they are the SAME size. I don't know what's going on, but I want a refund.",1
Gerber All In One Waterproof Trainer for Boys 2T - 3T (28-35 lbs.),Ordered a 2T for my two year old and my 10 year old niece can easily fit into these!! Gerber is normally not OFF like this on the sizes-- SENDING these back and demanding refund. TERRIBLE......,1
"Medela Contact Nipple Shield, Small","I couldn't get my baby to latch at all during first 24 hrs of birth. All the nurses tried to help and he'd get on for maybe 2 seconds, we have multiple nursing lactation consultants come in to help and they had no luck. Finally after 24 hrs one of them recommended this because my poor baby was frustrated and starving.One of my nipples is still sore but that's because of how I am putting him on I think because my other one I can barely feel now when he's on and he's almost 2 weeks old.  I used lanolin on the sore one and it's not so bad when I get him at the right angle.This is really easy to clean to. Between feedings just wash with little soap and warm/hot water then I keep it in a sealed bowl near my bed for feedings.  It helps when you can't get baby to eat and you still want that bonding and contact!",4
Cloth Diaper Sprayer--styles may vary,This product is great. I used to have Bumginus spray shower and thought it was good. But I moved and left it at the house so I had to buy again. And my husband bought this.Water pressure  is very strong and you can clean even infant poop. I love it!,5
Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor,"I purchased this monitor as a video monitor newby.  My first son's room was right across the hall from us and I could easily here his cries, but with our second son's room down the hall and a 3 year old to keep up with as well, I knew I needed some type of monitor.  I chose a video monitor by Summer Infant because after MUCH research, they seem to have the best reviews on several websites.  The modern look of the Baby Touch appealed right away, but the reviews were what kept this one at the top of my list.  I was hesitant after hearing a few reports of interference with Wifi because the main time I see us on the computer or watching Netflix on the TV would be when baby is asleep. As soon as the monitor came, I hooked it up in the nursery and brought the receiver downstairs.  My husband and I tried it out without any setup or issues. It was plug and play!  I love the talk back feature and see this as something we will use to talk to each other and eventually to the baby.  I will probably even move it to the room our boys will share when they are bigger and we have them share bunk beds.  The next thing we tried was the pan and zoom feature.  It worked really well and since we have never had any type of monitor the video quality looked fine. I will be able to see and hear baby and that's the point, right?  The last thing we tried out was having the monitor on and searching on the internet.  No problems.  My husband even streamed Hulu without any problems.  Then, I turned on the TV with our Wifi Netflix as well with no issues.  Baby is still in our room since he is only a few days old, but as soon as we move him to his crib I know I will sleep better with this monitor by my bed.  The only thing I haven't tested is the range.  I'm hoping it will reach in our backyard in case our toddler wants to kick the soccer ball during little man's nap time.  I'll update this review when the time comes.  So far so good and I am glad that we spent the money on this monitor.  I know we will use it for several years.",5
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue),"It works as advertised... and when the little part that goes against baby's nose got into the garbage disposal for a day or two, when we pulled it out, there was no damage. Amazing.We call ours the snot hookah. It causes the least trauma of any nasal suction device I've yet used.ETA:We've now had this two years. I don't use it often but it is still very effective. Word to the wise, however... little babies just turn their heads and it's not too hard to use this. Using it on an active and seriously pissed-off toddler is like trying to play the bagpipes while washing a cat. Wear protective gear.",5

Sock Ons Clever Little Things That Keep Baby Socks On! 6 - 12m (Baby Blue),It's one of those things that you wish you'd invented! Sock Ons were worn by our newborn for at least his first 8 months. Now I'm back to buy more for #2 and to give gifts for other friends with kids. This is simply a MUST HAVE for your baby's wardrobe!,5
"JL Childress Gate Check Bag for Umbrella Strollers, Red",We got this to gate check our chicco umbrella stroller when the bag it came with ripped after being used a couple times.  It has worked great.We are about to travel for the first time with our double stroller and bought the maclaren bag for our Maclaren Twin Triumph .... it is HUGE.  So I decided to see if the Maclaren Twin Triumph would fit in here and it does.  I am so happy $12 is a lot better then $56.  I also love that this is red and easy to spot at gate check.,5
Sassy Pop n' Push Car,We took it out of the box and she barely would let me get it out of its packing (just twisty ties really). I was surprised that after showing her how to pull it back and watch it go she understood the concept. She played with it for 30mins straight! : ).. too cute. She loves crawling after it. For the price it is a must have!,5

"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","Between school lunches, field trips and Sunday family picnics, lunch boxes are one of my family's main must-haves.  We need something that actually keeps the turkey and yogurt cool but is cute enough that my kids get excited about lunch.  We bought three of these lunch bags - all different animals - and my kids love showing them off while digging into their meal.  They are the perfect size for lunch and for storing between meals.  Thanks again Skip Hop for making something darling AND practical!",5
Baby Einstein Octoplush,"The baby that got this as a gift loves it. He loves the colors, lights and music. Definitely recommend this product.",4
"UPPAbaby G-Luxe Stroller, Black Jake","We bought this for airline travel and shopping and love it.  It is very easy to fold, very light and seems comfortable for our daughter.  The basket is also large and easily accessible.  A great feature is that you can detach the hip strap from the shoulder strap which allows our daughter to lean forward and see more.  I am not sure I would buy the color red again because it is very bright and may be responsible for her not falling asleep in it yet. You also can't run with it unless you lift the front wheels because they become unstable quickly but that's not what we bought it for anyway.",5
"OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Pink","This dispenser is seriously good. My wife and I got tired of the cheap, junky wipes dispensers that come free with most baby wipes. I have a ton of OXO products in my kitchen already and love their practical design. This dispenser delivers exactly as you'd expect from an OXO product. The gasket seals the wipes well and keeps them moist longer than the cheap, free dispensers. It can be easily operated with one hand, the lid opens and closes with a slight press. The dispenser has some heft, so you won't be moving it around just by pulling wipes out. The weighted piece in the middle keeps a wipe popped up like a kleenex and ready to grab without snagging a couple.I couldn't be happier with the product. We are using it with Pampers Sensitive wipes and it works flawlessly. The window on the front isn't really important since we're opening it so often, I notice when the stock is low. Another thing to note is that the dispenser is mostly white - the color selection only changes the color of the gasket and weighted piece.",5
Sassy Earth Brights Wooden Spring Bouquet,"There is absolutely nothing fancy about this rattle, but that's what I love about it. As it is made of wood, it makes a nice ""clacking"" sound, which my baby really likes, and the flowers offer a traditional rattle sound, crinkle sound, and various textures. It's easy for my baby to grab, but she is a little older (8 months when we bought it). If your baby is younger and still NEEDS many thin loops or easy handles to get tiny fingers stuck in (in order to grasp objects), then this rattle may be more difficult as all of the pieces are chunky. Frankly, the primary reason I bought this was because it felt like a cleaner, safer, more earth friendly alternative to the many plastic rattles available, and it has met all of those expectations. This is not a toy that will hold attention for hours at a time, but it will keep her entertained long enough to stop fussing in a waiting room or a line. Finally, my baby does actually play with this rattle instead of just chewing on it, so if you're wanting a chew toy, this probably isn't what you're looking for (besides, would you want to suck on a block of wood?).",5
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Pink",I was using disposable placemats that stick in place.  This placemat is certainly more economical.  It covers the perfect amount of space so that all of my baby's food stays on the placemat and not the table.  I thought the spill catcher would get in the way but it doesn't and in fact catches some of the food he drops.  Definintly worth the money.,4
Ikea PATRULL Non-Slip Bath Mat - Green Crocodile,"I really like this bath mat. I read the reviews and although there were some concerns posted by other users, I decided to try it for myself.The mat doesn't cover the whole bottom of the tub, but I expected that. I don't think it really needs to cover every inch anyway.We do have a slightly textured tub surface, so the mat doesn't stick the way a regular suction cup would stick to a flat surface. Other users are correct when they say the mat doesn't stick to the textured surface but that it doesn't move either. But I have been putting the mat in after I begin filling up the tub, and when I pull the mat up after my son's bath, it does make a popping sound. So although it doesn't glue itself to the bottom of the tub, it does stick fairly well to our textured tub.I guess this bring me to my final comment. A lot of others have complained that the mat gets moldy after a few weeks of use. We haven't had any problems with this, because we shake the mat off and hang it up after every bath like the directions say to.This mat serves its purpose with no issues thus far and my son seems to like it too - that's good enough for me.",5
Fisher-Price Coco Sorbet Soothing Motions Glider,"We got this as a hand me down and even though it's a few years old, it works great! I love that it's portable and uses batteries so I don't have to keep it near an outlet. It glides smoothly and the seat can be rotated to change directions of the glide. Our little on loved it for his first 4-5 months of life and slept well in it for naps. I don't recommend it for sleeping through the night just because baby doesn't sleep flat on his back in this glider.If you're looking for more baby gear reviews visit the website AllMomsArePerfect.com It has down to earth reviews from a perfectionist mom who does a ton of research on baby products. You'll find a stroller shopping guide, baby carrier guide, and what to expect after the delivery (stuff no one takes about).",4
Knit Crib Sheet - Sage,"I have this sheet in sage, and I think it's a great sheet. I've had absolutely no problems with shrinkage and have washed it multiple times in warm water. I like this sheet a lot. It's very soft, and it's not as cold to the touch as regular sheets are, which is nice for baby.",5
"Nuby No Spill Sport Sipper, Colors May Vary, 10 Ounce",We bought this cup for our twin boys (Toddlers) and they started using it. One day my son just dropped the cup (it was full) on the floor and it cracked and became useless. This is unfortunate as it was new and have not been used frequently at all. I would not recommend this product at all.,2
"Charlie Banana Diaper Liners In Roll, Natural, 100-Count","I was so disappointed in these because I LOVE my Charlie Banana cloth diapers. I thought these were going to be more like the pads you can put in and then dispose of...but, alas, they are not.I don't know what these are supposed to do exactly.  They are rough and I wouldn't want them touching my bottom!  They are super thin so they don't absorb anything either.  What can I do with them now that I have them???",1
"Summer Infant Soothe and Sleep Bassinet with Motion, Sweet Lamb","This beautiful bassinet makes the perfect first bed for an infant.  It has rocking motion that can be timed, lulling sounds like a mother's heartbeat, and it looks beautiful to boot.  It is on rolling casters that can be locked so baby can be moved from one room to another depending on the parents' needs.  It plays music and sounds and has a timer so that baby can be soothed into sleep.  On top of that, it has a large container underneath where diapers or other necessities can be stored.  I fell in love with this bassinet at first sight and I can't think of anything more perfect for baby's first sleep.",5
"The Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Aqua Stripe)","Why I like the Woombie:*It keeps your baby's arms and hands snug and warm inside, so she won't flail around or scratch herself. But it also allows some space for her to gently stretch her limbs. It mimics the womb (hence the name!)*The cotton is soft and breathable, and prevents overheating.*The Woombie comes in tons of colors, and several different sizes and fabrics for warmer or cooler weather. The original Woombie sells for $25.99.*It's the easiest thing ever to use! Just put baby inside it and zip it up!*It's won awards from PTPA, Moms Best, and Creative Child.Read more of my baby product reviews on my blog over here:[..]",4

"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)",This bottle was perfect for our little one.  She wasn't a burper and this bottle helped a lot with her spit up.

The bottle consistes of 5 different parts so when you was dishes you need to make sure you have all the parts before emptying the sink.,5
"Sassy Seat Doorway Jumper, 5 Toys","We did not buy from amazon- however my baby loved bouncing in this. It is safe and comfortable, has lots of fun toys, and is easy to wash. You must have a molded door frame for it to secure to. Adjust height when baby is NOT in seat. Very strong and sturdy. My daughter (now 4) loved this and was great entertainment while I made dinner. Also didn't take up much room. My son will likely love this too when he is old enough to use it!!!",5

Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,"I got this as a gift for Christmas, as this was when my son was about to turn 5 months old.People keep writing that their 16 pound baby does not have room to move or grow, , my baby is bigger than average and still has room to grow and is comfortable, not squished.The colors are nice, it is sturdy and easy to clean.I like the way it buckles together, it is very easy to get my son out of the seat.The directions say to push the tray onto the chair, much easier and nicer on the chair if you either pull the side handles or push the Fisher Price button on the front and slide it on.I do not like that it only has two wheels in the front, I wish it had two in the back also or something, it is very hard to move out of the way or to move period.Folding it up is difficult, as you have to LAY it down on its side (the directions tell you to do this as well) and then fold it, and then it DOES NOT lock. If you have a closet, maybe it does not matter to you that it does not fold but for someone without a closet to hide it away in, it makes it a little bit of a safety hazard if left folded but not propped in between things to hold the bottom from falling.I do like it though, i wanted this to match the Luv U Zoo Jumperoo.The seat cover does not seem to hold onto the seat very well, it says in the directions to insert side clips into slots on seat, but what slots are they talking about? If you try to put it anywhere besides where i have them, it does not work at all. So yes, I do have them in the right spot, it just does not hug the seat tightly.My son loves the colors, tries to look at the patterns and animals while eating in the chair.Good idea, but needs some improvements. I really wish it was easier to move.*******Had to send the seat to Fisher Price for manufacturing problem. The chair would not open and click into place unless i put my FULL (130 pounds) weight onto it. I did this for two days, the second day it would not even click open so I had to return it. Fisher Price was very helpful and sent me a refund check as soon as they received the chair. Not sure what the problem was, but the return was easy and they were very helpful.",2

"JJ Cole Satchel Diaper Bag, Green Arbor",This bag is stylish and has great compartments. However after four months of regular use the vinyl around the metal handle loops began to crack and shred. I knew over time they would rip right off the bag so I emailed Jj Cole customer service and they got me set up quickly with a new bag. Unfortunately they made me destroy the one I was using in order to send a new one which left me without a diaper bag for about a week. Their customer service was top notch though!,3

"Safety 1st Table Edge Protector, Medium","We've got two of these for an oversized coffee table (top and bottom edges), and they're great.  Very padded, my son has fallen on them many times and never hurt more than his ego.  Our coffee table is on the smaller end of the large size, and while it's a little loose, it stays in place well and still does the job.  These came with small corner pads to protect the bumper, which have also stayed put and been particularly useful, since our table has sharp corners.",5

Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"Spend a little more and get a better one or simply stick with an audio only monitor, as that is basically what you are getting with this one. There is no night vision, I could not even make out a blob for my daughters bed, The audio was acceptable but not great. We were gifted a Samsung monitor for our son and it is flawless. I went in search of a monitor for our daughter, who is 6, after we moved into a home where our bedrooms are 2 floors apart. It offered her a little more security. We ended up with the levana for her and while it does not compare to the samsung, it gets the job done for $80 less. The Infant Optics needs massive improvements.",1

"UPPAbaby Infant Snugseat Insert, Cream/Grey",I have been using the Uppa bassinet for my 8week old baby. I ordered the snug seat so we can start going running. FYI before the snug-seat my baby would slip through the side when using the stroller seat. With the Uppa snug seat my baby has great head support also super snug  and very comfortable. The snug seat is soft and thick to give support in the stroller. Now I don't worry about my baby slipping out or feeling uncomfortable.,5

Eddie Bauer 4 Piece Crib Set Little Builder,"This set is so adorable. The pattern is cute and the colors are great for the new little baby boy on the way.

"Gerber 5 Count Heavyweight Gauze Prefold, White","These are great burp cloths! They wash very nicely, however they take a little longer to dry completely.  I can dry a load of jeans and towels in 45 minutes but for some reason these will come out slightly damp on the same amount of time (with just baby clothes). I didn't know that when in the hospital, you will also get a bunch of these.  When I took my little boy home, they told me to take a bunch of blankets and these diapers (burp cloths).  I use one every time I nurse him for milk overflow (to much info I know, but they work great!) I wash them almost every day because i use so many and they hold up nicely. I also put one on the changing pad in case he decides to give me a shower, or decides he just wants to show me how well he poops.",4

bumGenius One-Size Cloth Diaper Twilight,"new to cloth diapering- trying to figure out if its right for you?- check out this link to help break down the lingo and facts: [...]. if that link doesnt work- i will copy and paste the info at the bottom of this review. And now- MY two cents....I used disposable first as my baby was too small to fit into his ALL-IN-ONE BumGenius pocket diapers. He grew into them once he reached 10 lbs. (around 1 month old). Originally I only had 20 diapers but quickly purchased another 20. The total of 40 diapers ran around $650.00. If you do the math, thats what you will pay for dispoables in the first 5 - 6 months! I wash them on average twice a week and with each passing month they are circulating more slowly (as my baby's bowels function more regularly and effeceintly). They are holding up very well so far. VERY few leaks. Actally had more leaks and blowouts with the disposable diapers- also more issues with diaper rash. They go on with ease- the velcro makes them just like disposable diapers. Once I have removed the used diaper I simply place it in my Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry Diaper Bag. I initially feared there would be smells through my house from this type of diapering. There is NO SMELL. I have asked visitors and no one even knew I was cloth diapering due to a dirty diaper smell. To wash, I use a special detergent on them: Charlie's Soap Powder or Rockin Green Cloth Diaper and Laundry Detergent. Until the baby begins on solids, soiled diapers can go right from the wetbag to the wash- just add a presoak and extra rinse as you follow the washing instructions. Once you are getting solid bowel movements- you can use liners and shke solids off into a toilet. Warning- even if liner says ""flushable"" DO NOT FLUSH- its not worth the plumming bill!These diapers make cloth diapering as easy as disposable with the obvious $$$ benefit. I dont know why people are still using disposable diapers. REALLY, what a waste of money!HERES THE INFO FROM THAT LINK IN THE BEGINNING OF MY REVIEW:Curious About Cloth?Get the Skinny on Today's Cloth DiapersToday's parents make hundreds of decisions for their little ones with a combination of instinct, friends' advice, and research. Even with the recent surge in sales of new types of cloth diapers, many parents remain unaware of the latest developments in cloth.  Curious moms are going to the Internet to research, but basic information is still somewhat hard to find.There have always been economic and environmental advantages to using cloth diapers. Clearly, having diapers that can be washed and used again saves (a lot of) money and keeps disposable diapers from filling up landfills. Even the most expensive and fancy cloth diapering system will save the average family $1,000 or more over disposables. Unfortunately, many moms today still envision cloth diapering as squares of cotton, safety pins (eek!) and plastic pants.CuteyBaby wants to help!  Here we summarize the general categories of modern cloth diapers and give you the pros and cons of using each type:The ""Wrap with Prefolds"" diaper:Bummis Whisper WrapThe closest thing to traditional cloth diapering of all the modern diapers. The Wrap (also called a ""Cover"") is waterproof, typically PUL (Polyester Urethane Laminate) fabric with elastic edges. Some Wraps put the PUL between layers of cotton for a very soft feel. The Wrap usually closes with Velcro or snaps so you can adjust fit. Absorbent layers - which could be cotton, hemp, bamboo, or microfiber - are placed inside the wrap to hold liquid. Some moms attach the absorbent layers with a Snappi closure. A ""prefold"" just refers to the old kind of diaper with thickness down the center.Hemp Babies FlatsSeveral manufacturers make squares (""Prefolds"" or ""Flats"") that you fold in thirds to use inside a Wrap. Prefolds and Flats can be a variety of materials. Cotton and hemp are popular. At changing time, some moms will just switch the absorbent layers and re-use the Wrap/Cover if the baby is only a little wet.Pros: Cheap - the least expensive of cloth diaper styles. Flexible - Moms can adjust absorbency by adding more layers.Cons: Putting them together requires extra time, effort.Examples: Wraps: Bummis, Thirsties, Imse VimsePrefolds/Flats: Swaddlebees, Bummis, Green Acre Designs, Hemp BabiesThe ""Wrap with Fitted"" diaper:Kissaluvs Fitted Cloth DiaperThis diapering method is similar to the ""Wrap with Prefolds"" approach except it has a fitted absorbent layer. Several manufacturers make fitted diapers in cotton, bamboo, and other natural fiber blends. The absorbent fitted diaper may have Velcro or snaps to close, and the wrap goes over it to form a moisture barrier.Pros: Better absorbency and comfort than ""Wrap with Prefolds"".Cons: Sort of like putting 2 diapers on, need to buy more sizes, longer drying times than flats.Examples: Fitteds: Kissaluvs, Swaddlebees, Baby Beehinds, ThirstiesWraps: see aboveThe ""Pocket"" Diaper:Bum Genius Pocket DiaperPocket diapers are made with an outer PUL waterproof layer, inside wicking layer, and ""stuffed"" with washable absorbent pads (called soakers, doublers, boosters) from an opening in (usually the back edge of) the diaper. It is the most common design because it can be loaded up with absorbent layers that stay relatively in place. There is typically a soft interior material, which gives the baby healthier skin and a dryer feel. Pocket diapers are often ""one-size"" designs that can be adjusted to fit babies of different sizes.Pros: Selection - Many options with snaps, Velcro, different soakers. Adjustability - fits a wide variety of infants. Absorbency can be adjusted by stuffing in extra soakers.Cons: Requires disassembly before and re-stuffing after washing. Some fleece insides may stain. One-size designs can be bulky at the small settings and may not fit up to potty training age.Examples: Happy Heiny, Fuzzi Bunz, Bum Genius, Smartipants, Blueberry, Rocky MountainThe ""All-In-One/All-In-Two"" diaper (AIO or AI2):CuteyBaby All-in-One Cloth DiaperThese diapers are usually all one piece but sometimes have a snap in soaker, making it an ""all-in-two"". The easiest type to use, they require little or no assembly and, like all cloth diapers, can be washed in a regular home washing machine. Outer layer is waterproof and typically PUL polyester or nylon fabric and the inside usually includes a multi-layer microfiber (also called microterry) or cotton soaker for absorbency. Some AIO/AI2 diapers come in sizes, and other are adjustable ""one-size"" designs.Pros: Simple - Very easy to use, no stuffing/assembly needed.Cons: Often require longer drying times, may not have enough built-in absorbency.Examples: Dream-Eze, GroBaby, CuteyBabyDiaper DialogueGetting started with cloth diapers can be confusing! Different manufacturers may call something by different names. To help you sort things out, here are a few of the most common terms:Soaker: The soaker is the highly absorbent portion of the diaper. A soaker may be a completely separate piece that is either laid or snapped into the diaper, or it can be partially or fully attached. Soakers usually have multiple layers stitched together to form a long pad shape (can be rectangular or contoured). Also see: DoublerDoubler: A doubler looks like a pad and is an absorbent soaker that can be added to a cloth diaper if you are having leakage problems or for times when extra protection may be needed such as overnight. It ""doubles"" the absorbency of the original soaker, hence the name.Booster: Like a doubler (above), but lighter-duty. Boosters ""boost"" the absorbency of a soaker, hence the name.Liner: This is a super-thin (paper-like) layer that some moms like to put on top, inside their cloth diapers. Liners are disposable or flushable and usually come on a roll. Liquids flow through to the diaper as usual, but liners keep the poop from staining or sticking - you can flush or throw them away at each diaper change.Snappi: A special ""T"" or ""Y"" shaped plastic closure to secure fitteds or contours (like a fitted with no elastic or closure) on the baby (replaces diaper pins). Snappis are not needed for Pocket or All-in-One/Two diaper styles.One-size vs. Sized/Fitted: Some diapers have adjustability built-in, others come in sizes. Usually you sacrifice some comfort at the high and low end of the size range for ""One-size"" diapers. Sized diapers will give the best fit, but you will need to buy more as your baby grows.  Check out our Cloth Diaper Comparison chart to see how a size ""medium"" fitted diaper compares to ""one-size"" diapers in a few of the top diaper lines.Wet Bag: Many moms like to have these washable, waterproof fabric zipper bags for dirty diapers. You can also just stash some plastic grocery bags in your diaper bag to bring home dirties. Wet Bags come in a variety of sizes and large ones are nice to have near your changing area to hold the day's diaper laundry.Fabrics:PUL: Polyester Urethane Laminate (PUL) is used as a waterproof outer (or layer) fabric for many Wraps, Pocket, and All-in-One/Two diapers. 100% Polyester interlock is laminated (could be 1-2 mil thickness) on one side and becomes waterproof but remains breathable. Good quality PUL can withstand very high temperatures and should last for 100s of washings. Note: we have heard both P.U.L. and ""pull"" as pronociations.Microfiber/Microterry: Microterry fiber is a low-lint, soft fiber that is ideal for use as a cloth diaper soaker, doubler or booster. It is the most common fabric used for Pocket diaper soakers. Good quality microfiber has a velvety feel and typically contains 80% polyester and 20% polyamide fibers. Microfiber is 3-4 times as absorbent as cotton for the same bulk and will dry faster.Suedecloth: Used as a lining in many pocket and All-in-One/Two diapers, suedecloth is typically 100% polyester woven material that has a soft feel. It resists staining and wicks away moisture to the inside of the diaper.  The fabric will not hold moisture making cleanup a breeze and keeping baby's skin drier than cotton.Microfleece / Microchamois: Thin, soft fleece is used as a lining in some pocket diapers. This is usually 100% polyester or sometimes recycled plastic fiber content. Microfleece and microchamois (pronounced micro-shammy) have a soft feel against the skin and pull moisture in to the soaking layers. They do stain more easily than other lining fabrics.Cotton: Our old friend cotton still plays a big role in diapering. Organic cotton is a popular soaker/inside material and is used for fitted and contour diapers (that require a cover). Cotton is very slow to dry and may require up to 8 washes before it reaches full absorbency. Organic cotton is grown without chemical pesticides, which costs more, but is kinder to the environment. However, organic and ""regular"" cotton perform the same in diapering.Hemp (fleece, terry): Hemp is stronger, more absorbent, and more durable than cotton and most other fabrics. Hemp on its own is not soft enough for baby's skin, so most hemp fabrics are 55% hemp with 45% cotton. Hemp also carries natural antibacterial properties. Hemp requires several hot washes to reach full absorbency (called prepping), and it will shrink A LOT - usually in one direction. Hemp absorbs like crazy and many moms swear by hemp Doublers/Boosters (see above) for night time cloth diapering.Bamboo (fleece, velour): Bamboo has a silky texture and is very absorbent. It is a naturally antibacterial fiber that will not lose its softness after countless washes. Bamboo fleece and velour are used in fitted diapers and as interior diaper fabrics. Along with hemp, bamboo is kind to the environment due to it being easily renewable and bug-resistant. Bamboo and hemp are still quite expensive fabrics, and that will show in the price of diapers that use them.Wool: Many experienced cloth diapering moms swear by wool outer layers. Wool requires some special care to keep its water resistance, and I wouldn't recommend it for a mom who is trying out cloth diapering for the first time. However, if you are really dedicated to using natural fibers, this is the only one with built-in moisture resisting qualities.What do you do with the poop?Modern diapers do NOT get soaked in an icky pail of wet stuff! Thank goodness!! Most cloth diapers will have the instruction: ""shake off solids"" and then wash in hot water with 1/3 the normal amount of liquid detergent. If you are new to cloth diapering, I recommend getting some disposable/flushable liners with your first purchase. If you line the diapers, then you just lift off the little liner thing and trash or flush it. If no liner, then you sort of shake poops out into the toilet. Some moms like to have their dirty diaper bin in the bathroom. So at changing time they take off the dirty dipe, set it aside, put on fresh diaper - then walk into the bathroom & shake out / flush, leaving the dirties in a container or laundry bag in the bathroom. Other moms (myself included) have two bins by the changing table - one for trash (shake out or put liner in there) and one for the diaper laundry. You can wash every 1-3 days, depending on preference, and how many diapers you have.Want to try it out?Lots of cloth diapering moms (myself included) started out just wanting to cut down on trash & expenses and were willing to ""test drive"" cloth for part-time use. If you want to try cloth diapering, pick the type of diaper that suits you best and buy enough for one day's use (usually 6-10 diapers or 4-6 wraps plus prefold/fitted). Maybe pick two brands and buy a few of each so you can see what you like best. Once you see that it's ""no big deal"" you can expand your collection - or ""stash"" of diapers, as we say. If you don't like it, there are several sites where people buy pre-owned diapers in good condition. Simply take a quick photo, post your items for sale on Diaper Swappers or eBay, and make your graceful exit from cloth.Note: If you have a cloth diaper retailer near you, DO go to a specialty shop. The people there can be extremely helpful and will answer any questions you have about the different types of cloth diapers.",5

"green sprouts Baby Food Mill, Green","We previously had a KidCo baby food meal.  It worked great.  We decided to try the Green Sprouts because it is eco-friendly.  Well, it belongs in the recycling container.  The blade/strainer does not stay in place when grinding foods.  We have cleaned up many messes as a result of the blade/strainer popping out.  The seal is marginal at best.  Grinding anything with moisture causes liquid to flow down base and on to the countertop.  Finally, the mill leaves a good portion of unground food.  Easily an inch worth of compressed food is left unground.  Very disappointed. It might make great compost, minus the steel blade.",1
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","I love this product but I have to give it 4 stars. I have used it on my last two kids and always end up detaching the head piece from the rest of the product because it's just too much. It's great for the first time I bring them home from the hospital and they are still so tiny, but within a week it takes up too much space in the car seat. The headrest portion is great and I use that piece for months, but the rest ends up getting put away somewhere. So, it's nice for a week or so until your baby outgrows it.",4

Cloud B Two Piece Combo Set - One Twilight Turtle &amp; One Twilight Lady Bug,"We bought the sea turtle for our 6 year old daughter, who was still having difficulty going to sleep by herself. (I know, I know - we consulted the sleep books years ago. Long story.) Anyway, this has done the trick!  It lights up the ceiling and walls in her cozy room, as one other reviewer indicated. I even find myself wanting one-it's so very zen.  The only thing missing is an ipod input and speakers for the Guided Meditations track (see this in the CD section!) It is beautiful and soothing. The ladybug is just as beautiful.  My go-to gift for baby showers and birthday presents now.  You can't go wrong with any of them!Caveat-they DO turn off after 45 minutes, so you may need to reset, or know that they function as more of a ""helping to sleep"" light, rather than an ""all-night"" nightlight. Enjoy!",5

Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"Our son really loves his jumperoo - he was 4 1/2 mo when we got it for him.he wants to try to stand all the time now and this gives him the opportunity and gives mom a break!the only reason i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the size - it's huge and cannot be folded up or put away easily - but i knew that from the other reviews.  i have read that the exersaucers etc. that """"help them stand"""" should really only be used 1/2 hour at a time and only 2 x a day - babies that don't use them walk and crawl sooner according to this.  anyway - he usually gets tired of it around  30 min. anyway. but while he's in it he jumps like crazy and is now """"walking"""" one foot at a time.  it's nice that there aren't as many toys as on the exersaucer - sometimes it's a sensory overload.  all in all i think this is a great toy and adjustable too!",4
"Ju-Ju-Be Be All Diaper Bag, Lotus Lullaby","I've been on the hunt for the perfect diaper bag.  This is my fourth one, and, so far, the best.  There are so many great features, but a couple that I really appreciate are all the pockets and compartments to help me stay organized, and I love the fact that it's machine washable.  I recently purchased a Petunia Pickle Bottom diaper bag and was extremely disappointed.  Unlike the Ju Ju Be All bag, the PPB bag was not machine washable, did not hold it's shape, and the velcro was HORRIBLE (too loud, snagged my clothes, and, was overall, just a pain to deal with)!  I love the magnetic closures of the Ju Ju Be All bag.I originally saw the Ju Ju bag at Nordstrom, but later discovered it on Amazon and noticed that it was a bit cheaper than the dept. store and also offered free shipping.  When I placed my order, I was informed that I would receive my bag in about 14 days.  It was at my door in 48 hours!  Love the free shipping and super fast delivery.  I would definitely recommend the Ju Ju Be All bag, as well as Little Dudes and Divas retailer.",5

"Summer Infant SwaddlePod 2-Pack, Hungry Caterpillar, Newborn","My son loves to sleep in these and they are super convenient for night time diaper changes. However, after only about 2 weeks of using these (maybe 7-10 times each) both zippers broke and we had to throw them out. We ordered two packs and the other two are still working just fine. I'm not sure if we just got a bad pack but these two are already in the trash. We are very disappointed that they didn't last very long at all. The baby's size isn't to blame either because the other two still fit and work perfectly.",2
"KF Baby Diaper Bag Insert Organizer - 12 x 6.4 x 8 inch, Black","For the price this thing is great - which is why I bought it. If I had more money to spend on this kind of thing I would've gotten a better product from Etsy. At any rate, it does what it's supposed to do but it does have major downsides: The fabric feels cheap, sort of like really sturdy paper towels if that makes sense, but hey, there's a reason this thing is less than $20. And yes, it STINKS. I Febreezed it about six times because I'm wary of the thing falling apart in the wash. It seems sturdy enough, but not necessarily sturdy enough to hold up in the washing machine.",3

"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","Our son is now 3 months old and before we got this mat we were using a towel (folded up) under our knees when giving him a bath.  This worked OK but bath time was still a chore because we were still so uncomfortable on our knees. We just tried to hurry and finish his bath instead of letting him enjoy the water and play.  We got this mat for Christmas and LOVE it.  Bath time is now fun for all three of us.  It has so much padding for the knees and also for the arms/ elbows on the edge of the tub.  The suction cups allow it to stay in place while in use and it folds up for easy storage.  We have yet to use the pockets on it but I'm sure they will be useful as time goes on and more bath products are needed.  I would HIGHLY recommend this mat to any parents, grandparents or anyone who has to bathe a child or a pet for that matter!",5
The First Years FoldDown Single Bedrail,"This rail is NOT easy to assemble; it is frustrating, as the directions are poor and the parts do not always fit together perfectly. On top of that, nothing on the box told me it would require assembly! The supporting rails extend underneath the entire width of the mattress, which makes it very cumbersome to install, remove, store, or transport. Once you get through the unclear instructions and actually get it put together, and then have someone help you install the awkwardly long supporting rails, it does function well. However, I decided to go back to my old-style rail.",3
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This is the only gate I've seen that is approved for stairs. It is really good for this purpose. It is sometimes awkward to install to a railing. Make sure not to install it too low, it'll catch the floor and is difficult to open. If you install it too high, the little ones can squeeze under.",4
Infantino Wall Mounted Mobile - Lion,"My son started looking at this from the first week and he smiled at it long before he actively smiled at us! even when he is upset, we can take him to the changing table and tell him that 'Roary Lion' says hello and he will stop crying to look at him. My son has conversations with Roary too. The only drawback is you may have to modify the hanging part to work for your house set up. We attached ours to a swing out plant hanger :}",5
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,"Much safer than the old blue seat or any seat with suction cups! When my daughter was a baby (she is 5 now) I used the 4-in-1 from the first years, it worked alright until it broke (over zellest dad) Then we tried the 4-in-1 from safety first, my daughter who was average size leaned forward to get a toy and fell in to the waterface first with her legs stuck under the ring. Then we tried the blue swivel seat, The whole thing flipped over with her in it and our tub was not textured, all she was doing was kicking her feet. Thank goodness I always held on to her. Now with my son (13 months also averadge size) We have been using this seat for a few months: He has never fallen in to the water and he is more active than she was. I still don't let go of hem for obvious reasons, but this seat is much safer!!",5
The Floppy Seat: Deluxe Shopping Cart Seat Cover with EZ Carry Storage Bag!,"I recently purchased an EZ Floppy Seat for my 7 1/2 month old son. It is the best thing I've purchased for my son so far. I quickly realized I needed something to protect him when he outgrew his nice little infant carrier. Couldn't even think about putting him in a yucky shopping cart or public high chair and holding this little chunk was defintely not going to work. Not only does the floppy seat provide a safety barrier from germs in shopping carts and restaurant high chairs, it provides cushioning for my baby. Everyone is happy!",5

"Carters Easy Fit Sateen Crib Fitted Sheet, Ecru","I purchased this sheet for a Baby Cache crib with a Colgate Classica mattress. Colgate mattresses have squared corners so sometimes it's hard to find sheets that fit. This sheet first perfectly!

Squatty Potty 7&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"I was having difficulty with bowel movements following intestinal surgery, and a Physical Therapist recommended I try a stool under my feet.  I tried thick books and boxes without much success but then I got a Squatty Potty and it made a huge difference by getting my feet higher off the ground and spread wider.The 7-inch works fine for my home toilets, and I bought a 9-inch for work as the commercial toilet is higher.  I'm 6-feet tall.  They fit nicely with the toilet shapes.Would buy over and over again.  Just wish they had a folding travel version.",5
Wipe Aide - The Toilet Paper Moistener,It works well for us!  I'm not sure how long it will last.  I would like to see them make one out of glass.Worth buying!,4
Sticky Bellies -Sticky Bellies Monthly Milestone Stickers - Oh Sew Ready : Maternity : 12-40 Weeks,These are cute but they don't stick very well. We use them to take our baby's pic and had to keep readjusting them.They're fun colors though so I decided to still keep them and use them.,3
"Sassy Cuddle Bug Bouncer, Whimsical Bumble Bee","This thing is adorable, but I wish they'd but a few more dollars into the frame. The frame is hollow bent tubing, and while they say that it can support a baby up to 25 lbs, I feel like you'll wind up with this thing bending slowly towards the ground if you're baby is heavier than a softball. Between the vibration and the low weight allowance to start with, I worry that this could rattle apart, especially if your baby is a big squirmer.That said, this is super cute. I love how the butterfly wings double as a wrap. Despite the picture of what is clearly at least a 6 month old, this is intended more for newborns, as the height allowance won't get you much past that. The toys are on velcor rather than hooks, so your baby could pull one down with enough effort, which I actually like. The overall design is colorful, and it does only take about 5 minutes to put together. The battery case is annoying, as it is screwed shut, which is totally unnecessary and requires additional tools.Overall, a really cute option, and better designed that others I've seen, but for $45, its insufficient for what it can deliver.",2

Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,Got this monitor when we had our baby 3 months ago. It works well. The video quality is just like what other users say and the we've never had a reception issue yet. It lacks a few features that more expensive models have but this is good enough for us.,5
Boppy Luxe - Clouds,"The Boppy Pillow was one of the best things I received from my registry.  It really helped my husband when feeding our son, where he could get him positioned just right.  Also, when it was time to learn to sit up, it was a great tool.  Cover was easy to wash!  Definitely worth the money!!",5

Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,"For our 2nd child, we wanted to get a firmer mattress than we used for our 1st.  in hindsight, that 1st mattress was way too soft.  This is the best mattress we could have gotten for the money. Perfectly firm but not hard!  Our 8M old now sleeps very comfortably on this mattress.  She was in a cradle for the 1st 5mos.  Now she has plenty of room to roll around and sleep on her stomach without me panicking that the mattress is too soft.  The price for this mattress is fantastic... even if you used a 20% coupon @ Babies R Us, you would still probably pay more.  I would recommend this product to anyone for infants.",5
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,"First I want to say - buy this or something BEFORE your baby starts to gnaw on the crib. By the time that happens, the idea of doing a little research and ordering something online goes out the window. What are you doing baby! That's your awesome crib we bought and lovingly put together for you!I can be a bit of a perfectionist, so I took all the time to read the directions, apply the alcohol, wait for it to dry, etc. Even trying to be as careful as could be, I had a lot of trouble getting these to go on the crib straight. Not a big deal for some. For others, it may totally ruin the whole appearance of the crib to have a crooked, wavy crib rail. It would have been easier to keep straight if I started in the middle and pushed the sides down evenly, but I wanted to leave a little bubble of air under the top to provide some extra cushion.One last tip - it can take a couple of days for the adhesive to really set, so again, don't wait until your baby is already chewing things up, or this thing will probably just get pulled off. Once the adhesive has really set, you may be more worried about pulling paint off the crib when (if) it comes time to take this off.",4
"Graco SnugRide Classic Connect 30/35 Infant Car Seat Base, Tan",Just like the one that came with the car seat. I've had this for about a month and love no more car swapping with the base!,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"We got this when our daughter was 3.5 months old -- she's active and loves to jump & thump in her bouncy seat but was frustrated with reclining & kept trying to sit up. We thought she'd enjoy being upright and actually able to jump in this. She's tiny so we had to add a pillow underneath at first but just 6 weeks later and she's heavier and long enough to reach with a folded up yoga mat underneath. She LOVES this thing! The toys, the sounds, everything about it makes her really happy. It's been fun watching her figure out all the different gadgets too.Bonus: assembly was one of the easiest and fastest of all her toys!!",5
Harlow 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"I had been trying to find this set at a local store so I could see it in person. Unfortunately I couldn't but I loved the color and design. If it arrived and was 75% of what it looked like in the photo I would be satisfied. It was even better though!The black trim on the blanket is actually black velvet. The beautiful damask pattern is embroidered and sewn on and is not a flat pattern on the fabric. The bumper is half a cream with green & black outlined flower and the other part of the bumper is black and cream striped.The main photo hides the actual dust ruffle which is GORGEOUS. Cream with a black damask thick trim and green velvet trim where it meets the mattress.The boudoir accent pillow is black velvet embroidered with the green and cream leaves and green velvet trim. The color is spot on. It is an avocado/retro green.The sherpa blanket is satin on one side with the common super soft cream fuzzy chenille on the other side.The sheet is the same green with a small darker shade of green dot pattern on it. It is such a great mix of colors and textures I would highly recommend this set for a girls' room with a twist.The fabrics are all durable and thick, it is well made.I love, love, LOVE this bedding!",5

Sorelle Vista Adult Rails and Slats - France White,I have no complaints! The bed rail was very easy to install and color matches perfectly with the previously purchased crib. LOVE that this crib was so easily converted to a big girl bed!,5
"Beansprout Bella Mobile, Cream",The music plays too fast so it gets done in just a minute or so. Can't really walk away before you have to go back and wind it up again. Music is not really soothing playing that fast either. Only good thing is it matches my bedding :(,3
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack, Lavender or Citrus","This product doesn't cost much. They seem to work well, but I have added two or more to each closet. I'm using them in trash cans, hampers, etc. I have purchased them 2x and probably will buy more.",4
Tiddliwinks Blue Transportation Flecked Blanket,I searched the internet for another Tiddliwinks sage blanket as I am not sure they make this one anymore.  It is soooo soft and one of my twin daughters has become so attached to hers that I thought I better get a second just in case-she would go into shock if we lost it.  It washes well too.  It is my daughter's best friend.  I hope they make it again because it is a soft pretty blanket that I would recommend for a baby gift.,5
WubbaNub Brown Puppy,Okay this is just about the coolest product ever.  My son loves to take it everywhere.  He loves holding it almost as much as the pacifier.  Plus it makes people laugh to see him holding it.,5
"Mam Monsters Silicone Pacifier, Unisex, 6 Plus months, 2 count",These work great for our son though he doesn't seem super picky about binkies.  I also like the little leash you can get for Mam pacifiers though I wish the plastic clip was smaller.,5
Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We have 17 month old triplets and traditional highchairs consumed too much space. We have a solid wood island in our kitchen and these seats attach securely and with ease. They also work well at most restaurants at booths or tables. If you have a more formal table with trim around the under edge of the table, you may not be able to attach these chairs. Assuming your table can support the weight and doesn't have trim, these are a great value and save space. Now all of us can sit around our island for meals.",4
BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector,The Guardian Car Seat Protector offers great coverage. Now we do not have to put a towel under the car seat.,5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","We've liked this car seat for a couple years now - we have two of them.  The controversial buckle hasn't been a problem for us yet.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because 1.) the buckle problem we may have in the future and 2.) because the black and grey model isn't as soft as the the others.  I wish I knew the name of the fabric, but it's a little rough and more susceptible to velcro and other snags.  Take a look at the close up photo of the black/grey booster seat to get an idea of what I mean.",4
"5 Piece Dark Gray Suit with Shirt, Vest, and Tie - Size 10","It is a really nice suit for the price.  It also holds up really well, so I don't worry about handing it down to my 3 younger sons, too.  I would absolutely buy it again!",5
"Diono See Me Too, Black","I have spent almost four years looking for a mirror that will work with my OnStar rear view mirror and had gone through about five of them. This one finally works! I can see my toddlers in the back seat! It fits tightly too and doesn't wobble at all. My only complaint is that the mirror is a bit small for my Tahoe so I can only see one child at a time. Plus, the 360 joint gets a bit lose when it is hot.",4
Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,The first night we used this was the first night out of her rock 'n sleeper.  She slept 7 hours.  There was no transition from our room to hers.  She never seemed to notice!,5
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","My son, who is 10 months old, immediately knows how to use it. He never likes/cares any of teething toys, I bought about 10 different shape teething toys, I bought for him.Therefore, I was a little bit worry that he will not like this training toothbrush. After read all the reviews, I decided to give it a shot. He just loves it at the very 1st time I gave to him. The brush is soft enough for his baby gum and the handles were so easy for him to grape and bend.Actually, I am thinking to get another one just in case we lose this one.I will defiantly recommend this product to all my friends.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Waterfall Peek-a-Boo Soother,"My son loves this product. We bought this when he was 3 months old. We were looking for something to add to the Soundspa Lullaby we already owned (love that one too but the images on the ceiling were too far away for him at the time). He immediately loved it and it is great to play as he falls asleep. It is as described and has a soft setting and a louder setting. He still hasn't figured out how to turn it on himself but can usually do it by accident if he is kicking around.The only complaint I have is that when it is on the setting for motion, music and lights it only lasts like 5-6 min then it  turns off, and it drains the battery. Since he has not figured out how to turn it on himself yet it creates a hassle for us to have to go in and turn it back on if he hasn't fallen asleep yet. Overall I really like it, just wish that it would last longer when on the setting for motion, music and lights.We have been using a combination of the Rainforest Waterfall and the Soundspa Lullaby. this way when the Rainforest shuts off the soundspa lullaby will continue all night.",4
Fisher-Price Waddle Clacker,My son isn't too big on toys but he laughs at this one so I guess he likes it. :),4
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Bought the booster seat for a 5 month old who sits with assistance/support. I had three main considerations:1) I did not want to invest in buying a fancy high chair that has an option for infants to use it for just a couple of months but was concerned the baby will not be comfortable in this one.2) I looked for a chair that occupies minimal space by either folding or fitting under the dinning table3) I wanted something that is easy to keep clean.This booster is great in all of these three aspects and at times even exceeded my expectations:1) The baby is stable. We did put a folded blanket at the side of the chair to make the fit better. And I love the fact that this chair will continue to be used up until she sits at the table on a regular chair. Great investment! She likes the chair and gets tiered of sitting only near the end of the feeding session.2) The use of the two straps (one around the seat and one around the back of the chair) make it stable on the chair. It is low enough to be able to move the chair with the booster under the dinning table. So it takes minimal space and allows the baby to sit at the dinner table with the family, which makes feeding so much more fun.3) Cleaning-wise it is just wonderful -- easy to wipe off plastic that can be taken apart and thrown into the dishwasher.The only downside: You cannot put the baby in when the table compartment is attached to the chair. So you have to remove it and put it back in once the baby sits there. Its is not hard to do, but it is an annoying extra step to take, sometimes with a hungry or a fussy baby. Plus, I thought the whole point of a removable try is that you dont have to take off the whole table compartment for cleaning -- only the insert. But in reality you need to take them both anyways, so what's the point?!",4
BRICA Deluxe High Chair Cover,"Well designed with the toy straps, Fits most restaurant chairs and folds up very nicely. It's great to have this with us when we go out to eat. It's much easier than cleaning the chair every time.",5

"aden + anais Classic Muslin Swaddle Blanket 2 Pack, For The Birds","We received the camo design swaddles for our daughter when she was a few months old - just as summer was hitting. She's now two, and we've used them year round: that first summer, she they were the perfect swaddle - light, breathable, and wrappable even as she grew. By winter she no longer needed swaddling, but these swaddles morphed into the perfect soft sheet to create an additional layer beneath her blanket. So we've been using them about 1.5 years, and one of them finally developed a weak spot and tore (about a three inch hole). The second also shows signs of an approaching farewell. I'm sorry they didn't last longer, but considering the wear we put on them (almost continual use!), the've actually done splendidly. We're expecting another baby this summer, and this is the only swaddle I've put on my gift registry (or rather, the only brand and make - I've put a number of designs on!). Well worth the cost for comfort, durability, and plain snuggliness.",5

Baby Einstein Play &amp; Go Toy Arch,"The toys are cute and our baby enjoys them, but that is about all this thing has going for it.  I can't get this thing to clip onto anything securely.  It didn't work on the bouncer, carseat, stroller, high chair - you name it, this thing doesn't work with it.  The main reason is that the clips are poorly designed and either don't tighten enough or don't open up enough to be useful.  The other issue is that even if the clips are secured, the entire arch can be adjusted towards or away from the baby.  This is a cool idea, except when the baby grabs a toy and swings the entire arch around and slams it into his/her face.  It actually takes more force to activate the musical lion than it does to move the entire arch.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I waited to review this until I saw how it performed in the really-stinky-diaper stage.  Now, with my daughter at 1 year and eating lots of solids (and making really stinky diapers), I can happily recommend the diaper champ.  A couple suggestions: 1) as baby's poop gets stinkier, empty more often (at least once a week) and 2) every time you empty, spray with Lysol or similar product and wipe out with antibacterial cleaner.  This second step has kept the plastic from retaining a bad smell.I gave 4 stars because it's not ""perfect"" -- sometimes a little smell leaks out if it's very full.  But all around a good product, and not needing special refill bags is a huge benefit for a busy mom.",4
The Miami Neatnik Saucer High Chair Cover &amp; Placemat,"I agree with the previous reviewer.  It's a good idea that just doesn't work.  It's too large, I'm too far away from him and can't feed him...  well you know what that was when my son was 8 mos old.  I guess I could try it now that he's 15 mos.  If I do, I'll update review.",1

Baby Food Containers- Sprout Cups - Reusable Stackable Storage Cups (12 Pack) with Tray and Dry-erase Marker - 100% BPA Free (2 Oz),"We've used these jars for about 4 months now, and they've generally worked well.  Washing only in warm water and soap, the white labels are mostly intact though have begun to wear off.  The lids seal very well and have never leaked for us.  When packing them the fact they they click together is a nice feature.On the other hand: They don't really snap into the base very well, so we've ended up not using it. We just stack them upside down in a little tower with the lids separate.  Also, we use the OXO cube tray to freeze our baby food, and you can't even really fit one cube in these cups without thawing.  Each jar can fit 2-3 cubes worth of puree, but you have to thaw them first.  For this purpose, we've actually had much better luck just using 4oz canning jars.  We use the dry erase pen that came with these to label the lids.  They are easier to feed out of too.  So while there's nothing terrible about these cups, I would choose the glass canning jars (bonus: they can go in the dishwasher!). My husband has chimed in that these are a pain to wash.",3

Meeno Baby Cool Me Seat Liner Stroller - Baby Blue,This works perfectly in our stroller but is too big for a car seat so make sure you buy the car seat version if that's what you are looking for. Our son runs hot all the time so this helps keep him a little cooler in the stroller...I would also recommend a clip on fan.,4
"Boon Switch Containers, 6.5 Ounce","When my kid started eating snacks and taking food to school at almost a year old, i bought a whole bunch of cute containers for transporting the food, including Itsy Ritzy bags, Lunchskins, and these.  All work well for the right situation, but these are the most versatile and are the only ones where the Cheerios don't get stale and the bagel doesn't get yucky.  They are a great size for going out for a few hours, they fit in every kind of bag or purse, and they look good. Plus, i've found a huge added bonus: since they stay closed and are made of durable plastic, if you fill them with puffs they become a shake toy for your child when you're on the go!",5
Summer Rest Assured Sleeper,"Honestly I usually get the opposite so I was a bit shocked when I had this happen.We went to BRU to look for a cosleeper and found this one.  I almost always shop the economy and then go home and use my Amazon Prime. I told my DH that we can get it from Amazon cheaper.  We got home, I logge din and was shocked to see that on Amazon it is listed at almost twice the amount.  It was NOT on sale at BRU.  Sadly I have to go back to BRU and get it rather than order from Amazon ((which I LOVE doing)).",5

The sape of this brush is a winner, cleaning better in most difficult bottles where a hand nor sponge go easilyPros- Winner shape- Very durable, will last you 10 times more time than other bottle cleaners- Doesn't build mold easily.- Brush not soft, but not hard, so great. Brush be hardly pressured during the cleaning and will return to its original shape then.- Stick is had enough to apply pressure.No considerable cons... give it a try, you will like it.",5
"Maxi-Cosi Rodi XR Booster Car Seat, Walnut Brown","OK... I have to say that it's truly bizarre that there are no reviews for this seat anywhere!I bought it based on the crash testing ratings(tops in the German list and their standards are high) and because it looks cool.My daughter loves it and says it's comfy. The seatbelt never touches her neck.  It's very solid feeling... easy to reach across to fasten the seat belt... The cup holder is pretty weird... you have to take it off if someone needs to sit next to her.I had a Graco Booster that my daughter folded like a rag doll in when she slept... so off I went to find a booster that reclines.We've had this a couple of months now... sleeping is great, she still flops forward if she falls asleep in a funny position but I am able to adjust her then her head will stay back the rest of the time.We got the Chili color and it's great! Hot pink, apricot and a dark plum... very stylish.  I'm going to get a second one soon to replace her Britax in our other car.You should go to their website and pick England as your country... they have a movie there that shows assembly etc.  The British seat is a little different, but the movie was helpful to me on putting it together and setting the recline position.",5
"Britax Parkway SG-2 Booster Car Seat, Pewter Dots","The car seat works fine, and I know that it is safe. I had no problems installing it. I love the clip.  My only complaint is the armrests.  The are so small. My sons elbows can't even reach them with his coat on.  They are too low and totally non-functional.  I feel so bad for him sitting back there with his arms folded on his lap with no where to rest them.  He just looks uncomfortable.  Kids already have to let their legs dangle and now his arms dangle.  I can't stand it.  He puts up with it because he is enchanted with the fact that he can now buckle himself in. His old carseat which he outgrew, had nice armrests.  Overall, I would choose this booster seat again I suppose, because as far as I know it is the only one with that middle between the legs clip. I just expected more from this company, like armrests for example.*I'd like to make an amendment to my previous review.  I realized once I removed the back from the booster seat, the armrests were much more convenient for him to use.  Perhaps he was just getting too big for the booster seat with a back.  Now, he uses it with just the bottom, and it is wonderful!",4
Infantino Swift Classic Carrier Black,"A little confusing at first with all the straps and buckles, but easy to get the hang of. Easier for my husband to wear comfortably versus my sling. Comfortable and stylish enough especially for the unbeatable price. Baby seems to enjoy it for the most part...happy with my purchase :)",4
Kidkusion Hearth Kushion Taupe,"We purchased this for our fire place to protect my baby, but she now just loves to take it on and off. I wish there was a better way to put it on tightly rather than just with double sided tape. I have to keep re-taping it..now it's just annoying.",3
Infantino Jumbo Shape Sorter,"E-Z ordering fast Xmas shopping on AZ, gave to granddaughter for xmas, too many toys at once, well made in the FP quality.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,You really can not appreciate this device until you've used it.No smell unless you don't empty it for a week or more. An airtight vault it's not....but it does what it's designed to do very well.Who doesn't take out the trash more than once a week ? Same concept with this diaper pail.- From a Dad of a Newborn who's thankful he ignored the negative reviews.,5
"Thirsties Wet Diaper Bag, Hoot","Perfect size for spending the day out of the house. I even put the clean diapers in one, and dirty diapers in another because the bags are so convenient.",5
"Contours Lite Stroller, Tangerine","I bought this stroller in anticipation of summer travel and quick trips.  It is a fabulous stroller.  Very easy to maneuver, great features, and seems comfortable for my son.  We have other high end strollers and this has all the great features, but is so much lighter.",5
Lamaze Turtle Tunes,"This product came early, was in perfect condition and was exactly what I expected. The music notes sound wonderful. My son loves this toy.",5
"Thermos FUNtainer Bottle, Disney Princess, 12 Ounce","I purchased this solely for my daughter to take to school. I was concerned that the water in her non-insulated bottle was warm and non-drinkable after sitting in a warm classroom or worse yet a hot playground! This Thermos has met my expectations and then some.It is an ABSOLUTE MUST that you pre-chill the bottle before adding your beverage. The easy way is to wash the bottle, keep the cap off and place it in your refrigerator for a couple of hours. I usually leave mine in overnight. Then fill with ice and water.I can relax a little knowing my daughter has ice cold water all day. I loved this so much I purchased another for my other daughter.Keep in mind that even though the images on the bottle are nice they are NOT meant to last. We do not have a dishwasher so everything gets washed by hand. After several months of use the images are starting to fade and get washed away. That is the only bad thing about this thermos.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We love this swing. It keeps my newborn busy for some time. This is the only place -aside from grandma's arms- that he takes a daytime nap. Everywhere else, he wakes up every 10 minutes. My only complaint is that you can't remove the head support. It makes my baby's head tilt down. I am always worried that he won't be able to breathe. I try to prop him up higher so this does not happen. If he were taller (he is 21 inches now), this would not be a problem. Otherwise, it would have been 10 stars.",4

The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"It has sturdy sides to keep mom and dad off of it but enough mesh to allow air flow. I definitely recommend this to keep your baby close while you sleep.  It folds up and is easy to transport for a nap away from home, too.",4
"Carter's First Year Calendar, Blossom",This will be a cute addition to the matching baby book where my daughter can log all of her baby's first year outings and appointments and trips that wouldn't necessarily go in the milestones of the baby book.  (My daughter bought me the matching Grandma's Brag Book for me to show off my granddaughter to my friends and colleagues at work!),5
Woombie Sleeper - Baby Love-0-4m,"We live in upstate NY and winters are little bit colder here than normal so I started to shop around for a sleepsack with roomy, cozy, warm and comfy specified in my mind. I did not think I will find one with everything I want in it but I did with this sleepsack. My baby boy started to use it at 3mos and even if the sleeves are a little long, the neckline did not go over his chin so we just folded the sleeves. After 5 washes, the fabric was still the same- no shrinkage. I recommended this sleepsack to my friends and relatives and also in our online community blog since we were all looking for a sleepsack with sleeves! (and preferably one with the sleeves you can fold in to act as a mitten too)I gotta say that I heard good things from my friends about this product as well... I will continue to recommend it!",5
Vulli Chan Pie Gnon Natural Rubber Teether - Blue Chan,This toy is great.  It is not made out of that hard plastic that babies have a hard time squeezing.  This toy is extremely easy to squeeze yet safe and durable.  My child likes to suck and chew on the antennae.  It squeaks just like any other squeak toy.  If you buy this toy wiggle side to side rapidly with short motion and the head wiggles and it makes a funny squeaking noise that makes kids laugh.  This is a cute and different toy and I recommend this to everyone.  Definitely worth the money.,5
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner for Highchairs, Blue","The suction cups are worthless and my 9m olds have been peeling them up for months. THe Embossed designs make it less easy to just quickly wipe clean. The one thing I do love is the the little catch scoop that fits between the highchair and the counter, but I don&#8217;t even bother with the placemat anymore, because the twins only occasionally drop things on accidents.",3
Flip Toilet Potty Seat - Blue,ZERO STARS. It does NOT fit a standard toilet seat unless you live in a house where no man (or boy) needs to use the toilet. The hinge is too narrow and the seat won't flip up. I wasted a Sunday trying to install this while my daughter eagerly waited for her big girl potty seat. Now she is crying and I missed 2 football games.,1

"7 A.M. Enfant Pookie Poncho Baby Bunting Bag, Metallic Charcoal",Bought to use with our city mini stroller. Unless you want it loose and flapping around don't get it. Go with the JJ Cole Toddler bundle me instead. This product is clearly meant for a particular stroller and the city mini isn't it.,1
"The First Years Straw Cup, Pink Take and Toss, 10 Ounce, 4-Count","Cups can be used with regular bendy straws...the hard ones that come with cups cant really be washed...used a pipecleaner for a bit, then gave up...doesnt matter, a straw is a straw...you just lose the spill proof factor. Kids take out straws anyway. Wish they made 16 oz cups...i would use them.",4
2-in-1 Car Seat Cover `n Carry,"This is a great item in THEORY.  It does not work as well as expected.  The wheels and base are too small.  And halfway threw my first trip with it the zipper broke and the canvas ripped.  Since this is pretty much the only game in town for traveling by yourself with a toddler except a backpack which I can not use (bad Back), I have bought the second one.  And if it breaks I will probably buy another because it does allow me to push the stroller with the baby in it and pull the car seat.",3
Evenflo Single Breast Pump,My Medela pump hasnt been delivered yet so for my sanity my husband ran out and got me this one for now to ease my mind. for that purpose it worked and i could see usen this for travel if you have privacy .. but not for your average out and around .. oops im leeking let me discreetly go empty a lil in the ladies room and pump and dump. it is WAAAY TO LOUD! My husband can hear me threw closed bedroom door.I am hoping the 300 doller pump is much quieter. It is also awkward. you cant put it down without the stand or it topples over. And the little blue over flow piece simply falls out and you can loose it easy in the middle of the night when ur half asleep.. or even awake and just not ontop of the lil thing.id say the sound of it is equal to an old school dust busters sound.,3
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,My wife and I purchased this monitor 3 years ago when our daughter was born.  We still use this monitor to this day!  But we are having another baby in January so we are in the market to purchase another baby monitor.  Well that is why I am here to purchase another one of these baby monitors.  We absolutely love this product!  Some of the lower star reviews that you may have read more than likely never read the instructions before sing this product.  We have used other baby monitors that were given to us when our daughter was born but none of them were as reliable as this particular product.  Please do not let the negative reviews sway you from this product.  Just be sure to read the instructions completely and this product will not fail you.,5

"Philips AVENT BPA Free Non Spill Soft Spouts, 6 Months","My twins love these.  We have the klean kanteen bpa-free (obviously, since they are stainless steel) sippy cups.  They didn't like the green spouts the cup came with (same shape, also Avent), they were way too hard.  Got these, and my guys are super happy.  Highly recommended for moving your baby off of bottles.",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,We have been using this monitor for a couple years.  It still works well but has been dropped too many times and the antenna broke off.  So I just bought another one for my wife for Christmas.  Highly recommend.,5
Safety 1st Oven Front Lock,"I bought this based on the mostly good reviews it received...and kept my fingers crossed.  I thought I was going to be disappointed because it fell off a few times in the first night...mostly because we were playing with it.  But, after given a little time to adhere, it hasn't fallen off since then.  We have heated our oven to more than 350 degrees and it still stuck nicely.  It is a tight fit with our oven handle, but there is room, so we can manage.The one thing I don't like is that when you lift it up to open the oven door, it doesn't stay up.  This means it gets in the way when you try to close the oven door again.  You have to grab it and hold it up, which can get a little toasty on the fingers.  But, I'd rather have toasty hands that burnt toddler fingers.I bought a 2nd one and planned on using it for my dishwasher, but found that my counter is not laminated on the underside.  The adhesive didn't stick to the wood.  I have some laminate material that I may try to stick on the underside of the counter to see if that does the trick.Overall, this has been a great purchase and I would highly recommend it.",4
"Britax Parkway SG-2 Booster Car Seat, Pewter Dots",Easy to install and my 5 yr old was proficient in buckling himself in a month! And I like the added security of the between the legs piece.,5
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,It got here before I thought it would and it was easy to install and it works Grate. I should have bought 2 but now the price is up.,5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Suppose this was made as a baby door.. so i should not compare it when using it with animals...However, for the sake of many of you who may be buying this as a pet gate..Do note that when it has been bitten or chewed on one too many times.. some parts start to rust..So please do take note of that when considering this.In terms of It doing the job as advertised and preventing the animals from coming out. Rest assured it does it!",3
Lovely Baby-nappy Fasteners (Pack of 3),"When I removed them from the package they smelled like mothballs.  I had to leave them out of the package to get rid of the smell, so then my son's room smelled of mothballs for a couple of days.I'm not very impressed with the fasteners.  Since they are attached separately and it is not all one piece, the fasteners detach when trying to get a diaper put together.  Makes it quite difficult while wrangling a baby and trying to attach a diaper.",3
Munchkin Dora the Explorer Bath Squirters,"My two-year old granddaughter came to visit from California. Bath time is always special, but even more so when there are toys to add to the fun. She loved these. I ordered another set and had them sent to her.",5
Foogo by Thermos Leak-Proof SS 12 oz Straw Bottle in Blue,"I like that liquid stays cold all day and it doesn't leak in the vertical position like our other straw cups that allow liquid to warm and expand without venting.  However, it still leaks if turned upside down.  Also, watch your toes when baby drops it, and our 15 month old has pinched her fingers several times in hinge to the the flip open cover (no injury sustained).  I can't find a replacement part for the silicone straw that our 3-year old bit off.",4
Bright Starts Having A Ball Drop N Slide FUNCastle,"We got the pink unicorn version of this castle as a first birthday gift, and it's a wonderful toy. I didn't know if either of us would like it at first, but it's very fun. My little one likes figuring out where the balls are going and finding the secret trap doors and dropping others down the ramp. I like that the balls are compatible with our other Bright Starts toys too. The music is pleasant.",5
"Baby Month Onesie Stickers Baby Shower Gift BOY DANCE DOTS Photo Shower Stickers, baby shower gift by OnesieStickers","I bought these to use for my first baby and it worked well! I wish i would have done it for our second child! Well worth the money! Although you could probably make your own, these were great!",5
"Dreambaby Stroller Fan, White/Blue","Nice product. Serves the purpose. Only disadvantage was, I used it while air travel at airport. Carried it in cabin baggage. So had to remove the battery and while using it in transit airport had to put it back again. The screw at the back was star screw so it became difficult. Could have been designed to have a Flathead screw that can be fixed with even a coin",4
"NUK Active Silicone Spout Learning Cup, Ladybug, 10-Ounce","This product worked really great for us - we already had a dozen or so NUK bottles, so the sippy-spout worked with both this bottle (that it comes with) and the other bottles and collars that we already had.The spout was a great transition from bottle to sippy cup - our son wanted nothing to do with sippy cups but used this spout for about 3 weeks and then EASILY made the leap to the full sippy cup, well before his 1st birthday. Great product.",5
Levana Sophia 2.4&quot; Digital Video Baby Monitor,"This is my first Video Baby Monitor. Back when I had my kids the Audio Monitors were the only reasonably priced option so it's nice to have this available for use with my Grand-kids.  The instructions for set up were easy enough and truthfully that was the part that I was worried about most.  Once I had it set up and on, I tested out the sound and video quality both in the light and dark.  I was pleased with the sound as it picked up even small noises and surprisingly the clarity of picture was excellent in the light and dark. Additionally the peep mode, night light and temperature sensor are all nice additions, even if the temperature isn't always accurate. My only complaint is that the screen is so small and to get a good view of the baby, you need to place the camera somewhat close to the crib.  Overall I think that this is a great budget friendly video monitor.",4
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman","This is a great Pack 'N Play.  We have yet to test it out since our baby isnt' due for another few weeks but I have put it together and everything seems to be very functional and very sturdy.  I must say everything was easy to put togehter and figure out but the most frustrating part to assemble was the Napper/Changer.  It took a little bit to figure out how to manuver the metal bars to get them to click together.  Once I got it figured out the rest came easy.The next was the disassemble.  It seems as if the the Napper/Changer does not fully disassemble.  You can take the bars apart but you can't take the plastic end pieces off.  I tried everything and I came to the conclusion that if these were ment to come off that Graco would have not required tools to get it off.  Because of this when you pack up everything in the carring case the pieces to the Napper/Changer do not fit.  It's only two pieces and to me it isn't a big deal.  Just means I have to carry a bag in one hand and two pieces in the other.  Everything else, including the Napper/Changer padding, fits in the carry bag.I would have to say that once you get used to setting this up and taking it down that you should be able to be done in about 5-10 minutes depending on if you put the bassenet and Napper/Changer together.The wheels on the one side of the playard make is very easy to move incase it's in the way.The Napper/Changer is AWESOME!  It is the perfect depth for a baby to lay in and be cuddled up just right yet still leave enough room to put some extra padding such as blanket.  It is very sturdy.  I would have no issue and wouldn't worry one bit with him sleeping in it.The only true issue I would recommend to Graco is to try to design a specific way to pack the playard in the carrier.  This way you can than either design pockets or include small bags for pieces such as the bars for the bassenet, the mobile, and the Napper/Changer.  I would also recommend including in the instructions a recommended way of packing up the playard.  I had to figure this out on my own with all the extra pieces for the basenet and the Napper/Changer.",5

"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I was excited to get this. It works well for my daughter who is old enough to just start learning to take baths herself as well as for my newborn son. I know my daughter can check the water temperature to get her bath just right before getting in. I also have peace of mind bathing my little baby. When my daughter was little we had a rubber ducky that changed color if the water was too hot, but it was slow to work and also didn't alert you if the water was too cold. I love that this one makes a beeping noise to let you know if the water isn't within a safe and comfortable range.My daughter was playing with it and the turtle snapped off the yellow part and I can't seem to get them snapped back together but they can be put together and still work great they just separate easily.The temperature does seem to be accurate but I haven't tested it with another thermometer but we have been using it for weeks with success.",5
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Papillon,I love this cover!  The colors and pattern are just beautiful and I get tons of compliments on it.  The rigid part at the top is just right for looking down at my daughter without exposing anything and the rest of the cover is wide enough to maneuver her on and off without exposure.  She seems content and comfortable though I haven't used it in particularly hot weather.  The terry part sewn into the undersides of the bottom corners are great for clean ups and keep me from having to hunt for a burp cloth.  I also use this for pumping while in the car and I can get all the parts into place without flashing anyone.,5

"Mommys Helper Safe-Er-Grip Drip Dry Portable Drying Rack, White","Loved the idea of this drying rack to hang wet bibs from in the kitchen.  However, we tried it on wood, granite and wall and it wouldn't stick to any of the surfaces for longer than 15 minutes.  We are returning it for our money back.",1
"Thermos FUNtainer Bottle, Disney Princess, 12 Ounce","Bought one for my daughter to start drinking water from straw. The material and finishing are very good. Although the latch button is a bit tight initially but after a few weeks, my daughter is able to open the lids by herself now.",5

"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light , Blue",Amazing! We spend alot of time at our friends homes and ever since we bought this portable crib/playpen sleeping isn't a problem ANYWHERE! It takes maybe 20 seconds to put up and even less to set up. We use it as a play pen at home and because of its design it is perfect for my six month old to sit and watch the dogs pass by and I don't worry about him falling over becuase there are no hard surfaces inside the crib. This has already paid for itself and we recommend this to everyone.,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",The Dora potty seat goes with us everywhere when we go out. My daughter has recently potty trained but isn't ready to use the toilet yet so this seat is perfect. She also loves the pretty design :),5
Infantino Colors and Shapes Puzzle,"My 2 yr old twins love puzzles (just turned 2), they're pretty quick at most peg puzzles so we bought them this set and also a few Melissa and Doug jigsaw type w/10-12 pieces.  I think these are a better transition to regular puzzles because the pieces are easier for a toddler to put together and it focuses on a bunch of smaller pictures before moving onto a larger one.  I'm sure they will love the M&D; jigsaw later, but the Infantino puzzles are a great stepping stone.  I just ordered ""Where's my tail"" from Infantino.  Can't wait to receive it....Oh and an added bonus to the Infantino puzzles, they come in a nice easy to put away bucket....how cool!  My toddlers LOVE taking things in and out of buckets...so cleanup is another game!",5
Sevi B My Prince Cross Mobile Toy,"i love, love, love sevi products.  for both of my kids first christmases they received sevi music boxes and i bought this mobile for my daughter who is much more content to lie in her co-sleeper and stare up at things than my son ever was.  you have to give it a little push, but it will move slowly on it's on.  my only complaint is that the wood holder that would have went so nicely with it was poorly recommended, so i purchased the suggested plastic one which honestly isn't great either AND it's plastic. i'm constant adjusting it. :/  maybe do a bit more looking for a better holder.  but the quality of the mobile is fantastic, i love the story of the girl chasing her prince. :)",4
Teething Bling Pendant - Donut Shape (Bronze),"I love these necklaces. My baby always has a safe toy to chew on, and I don't have to worry about pieces breaking off or leaving it anywhere. She lights up when she sees it on my neck and loves to play with it when we go out somewhere and I'm holding her. No complaints at all.",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","I have to say that I do love this car seat with one huge exception, important enough for a 1 star rating. I have a 2004 Honda Pilot and this seat does not install tightly due to the way the seat belt anchors are made. I struggled for weeks, read instrucions, wathced videos, talked to experts online, and then took it to the local car seat inspectors office. Two of their car seat safety inspectors/installers could not get it in easily. Once it was in tightly, I felt like I could never get it out again for risk of not being able to reinstall it well. Just beware if you have this type of vehicle. The car seat otherwise has great features and fits my 6 yr old (36 lbs/45in) very comfortably.",1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I purchased this stroller for my babysitter as she is taking care of two other children aside from my baby. It is very helpful for her to take my baby and the three year old in the stroller while they walk the six year old to school. The material is great and the orange color is awesome. Although it can be a little heavy, it's well built. It is a great product!",5
Bink Link Pacifier Attacher - Candy Necklace,"These clips are very cute, I have two of them. I have to be honest that the clips do not hold onto fabric, and they are strange, you arent sure where to put the fabric in the first place because there are two places that it opens, and neither of them are entirely suitable. The peas and carrots I have works ok, but only opens wide enough in one place, the other one (this one) opens so wide in both places it wont hold a thing at all. I was sad I spent the money on this.",2
Baby Kid Safe Shower Bath Wash Hair Sunshade Shield Cap Shampoo Visor (pink),"When I received it, it was folded and stuffed into a small envelope from China. When I took it out it was completely misshapen and took a while for it to resemble the picture. It was also not as sturdy as it looked in the picture. I thought that the  rubbery foam material would have been thicker. Due to its thinness, it doesn't keep the water or shampoo out of my daughter's face. My advise is to save your money on this product and go for something more sturdy even if it mean spending more money!",1
Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 2 Wide Neck Nipple,we like this product. this is the only nipple that we found that our baby will latch on to. Thank you,4
Yookidoo Crawl N' Go Snail,"My 10 month old son loves this snail! But I'm pretty upset because I thought this snail would come with 2 shells as shown in multiple pictures. Mine only came with the stackable shell. I was already hesitant to pay $30, but to find that it comes with only 1 shell, I feel totally ripped off.When I called the company to ask where the other shell is, they said that they can't do anything because all their merchandise is handled by Amazon so I should contact them. I contacted Amazon and they said the description doesn't mention 2 shells (only 1) so there's nothing they can do about that. I said there are 2 pictures showing the other shell, and they told me in a very condescending tone, ""We undertand that ma'am but it is not our fault you didn't read the description."" They should remove the pictures if that's not what they're selling.My son loves the toy, so I'll keep it. But for what it is, it is not worth $30 + shipping, even with the extra shell!",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son has played with this toy nonstop.  He is now 16 months old and it is one of the first things he reaches for when he wakes up.  When we travel I have make sure its packed.  Some kids have blankets, mine has the music cube.",5
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,i use this to store breastmilk so my husband can feed the baby.  i also use the bottles to freeze breastmilk.  its great because its compatible for the medela pump but my baby isnt that fond of the nipples.  i end up using the avent for feeding and transfer the milk from the medela.  buy this if you are planning on storing a lot of milk.  otherwise you are better off with avent or gerber new traditions.,4
"Pampers Natural Stages Airwave Venting System, Stage 4, Twin Pack, Pink/Blue, 7 Ounces","I second the other reviewer who said her baby bit the spout off.  Mine have used their teeth to gnaw the opening open even further, so now, milk or juice just pours out of it, which renders them pretty useless.  If I don't thoroughly check the remaining cups I have, I will either have milk or juice all over the place  If I don't keep on top of this, my babies are caught off guard by the milk pouring out of the gaping hole they made at the end of the spout.  I've tried looking for replacements because the condition of the actual cup is great, but I cannot find replacement spouts (interesting).  So, I've pretty much tossed all of the bad spouts, and replaced the entire sippy cup collection with a different kind of cup & spout design (holes vs. a slash in some silicone).  Bad idea Pampers!!!",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter has had this giraffe since she was about 4 months and has loved it since day one.  She is currently 8 months and still loves to suck on it, chew on it, squeak it, or just ""pet"" it.  Great toy, and totally worth the price.",5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","This rock and play is a life saver!  I have newborn twins and one of them gets fussy and doesn't sleep well.  I ordered this with him in mind, after reading all the good reviews, and I am SO glad I did!  I am thinking of ordering one more and doing away with the pack and play!",5
Potty Tme Training Pants / Baby Swim Time Diaper Baby Blues Size 1,"The denim print looks better in the pic than in person, but the diaper holds up well. It fits nicely, but runs a little small. My son's 30th%ile and 15 months and he's already the on the largest setting. The stretchy material is really nice. It's not very absorbent, but the inner material is soft and you can stuff the pocket if you need to for more. The company shipped 2 days earlier than estimated as well. 5 stars.I ordered antonio bandana print as well and they sent me dump trucks. I didn't think it was worth sending back, but the dump truck fold over elastic is very poor quality compared to the baby blues. We've only used the diaper a few times and it looks in poor condition already. It looks ratty and pilly and old already. 1 star.",3
"Summer Infant Slumber Buddies, Frog","I love it and so does my 2 yr old daughter. She learned how to press all the buttons herself and loves to turn it on and change the colors and the songs. But none of that matters if it doesn't work. I'm on my 3rd one! Everytime it starts out working fine for a week or two and then it will go through new batteries everyday. Very dissapointing for me and more importantly, for my daughter",1
Summer Infant baby monitor battery,We bought this to replace the battery in the Summer Infant Video Monitor we received as a gift in 2008 to use for our second child.  It was compatible with our monitor and works great.,5
Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,This warmer is awesome.  I use it every single time I make her bottle to make sure it's at a good temperature.  It doesn't take long at all.  I just have to keep refilling the side pocket that needs water about every two or three days.  I recommend this!,5
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Captain Calamari","I recommended this for my best friend's five-month-old baby.  She was excited from the moment that she saw it and the excitement hasn't worn off, even months later.  As a matter fact, she has become rather upset when she is separated from it.  An absolute must-have!",5
"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","Super cute and soft and snuggly!  I thought long and hard about which lovey to buy for my daughter.  Love that this one is not traditionally &#34;pink&#34; or pastel.  The colors don't look out of place anywhere we go.  The little dog has &#34;sleeping&#34; eyes, so hopefully she will associate it with sleeping when she's older.  I wanted &#34;ears&#34; for nibbling or chewing, in case she ends up liking to do that.  Overall, a wonderful lovey I hope DD will love!",5
Preggie Pop Drops (21 Pieces) - Assortment of Sour Flavors ( Multi-Pack),was the only thing that would help with my morning/day sickness. wouldn't cure it completely but sure did take the edge off and helped a lot. wouldn't do another pregnancy with out them!,5
"BooginHead SippiGrip, Pink/Green/White",I actually bought two of these for myself and two more for a couple friends of mine.  I consider these a MUST for anyone with a sippy drinking child.  I always have them in my diaper bag for use at restaurants and find them useful on the go as well.  They are made well and I expect them to last until the sippys are gone a couple years from now.  AWESOME PRODUCT!!! Love these!,5
"Safety 1st Sound 'n Lights Activity Walker, Lil' Safari",First it doesn't go low enough and second wished the seat came of so it would be easier to clean.,4
Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,It's great for traveling solo. It is awesome in planes with aisles large enough to fit both luggage and carseat.,5
Hudson Baby Elephant Applique Fleece Blanket,"I bought these blankets for my two Yorkies, they love to snuggle in soft blankets and these do the trick. They are a tad bit thin, you'd probably have to double up if your intention is to keep a baby warm. Bt I liked the price and for what I needed,it got the job done...I have two happy Yorkies",4
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,This pillow is super tiny and a big disappointment.It does not provide adequate support or relief from the discomforts of pregnancy. I feel like I was mislead and I wasted my money.,1
Nosefrida Nasal Aspirator with addtional 20 Hygiene Filters,If you are continuing to torture yourself and child with an old fashioned bulb suction stop now and buy this device. This helps your new born breathe and sleep better in less time than it takes to clean one nostril with a squeeze bulb. This is my first review with my first child and I recommend this and wish I had seen it sooner. It would have been more rest for the baby and more peace of mind for us parents.,5
Custom Baby Girl Boutique - Safari 13 PCS Crib Bedding,"Let me start by saying. If you read the reviews on this set someone else says it is brown zebra not black. So before I added this set to my registry I knew it what I was going to get. I like the brown better because I didn't have a white or black crib I have cognac. It is a very nice set, I really like it and so does my husband! Nobody else in our small town would have gotten this one either so Resell is looking good! ;)",5
"Gerber 4 Count Rolled Birdseye Prefold Diaper, Multi color",These are a nice burp cloth. Not too thick or not too thin. I like the pretty colors too. Soft.,5
Skip Hop Dash - Canvas-Chocolate,"I love this bag... It's roomy and has plenty of pockets to keep everything organized.  But once I fit my extra set of clothing, recieving blankets, diapers and wipes, there isn't a lot of extra room left.  Since I breastfeed, this is fine, because I'm not toting around extra bottles and formula.  But if I were bottle feeding, I don't think there would be enough room for all the extras...  But a big plus is my husband has no proble carrying the bag, even if I am holding the baby!",4
Boppy Bare Naked Pillow,"I found the boppy pillow awkward and uncomfortable for nursing. I am an average sized person and slimmed up fairly fast after giving birth, and I found the boppy difficult to get around my midsection. I even watched a YouTube video thinking I was missing something. For me, it was easier to use a couple of normal pillows for breastfeeding. My daughter was too small to enjoy it in the first few months, it would swallow her. By the time she was two months, she would squirm or roll out of it. The best use I did find for it was to sit on it, like a donut, to relieve pressure after I gave birth.",2
Go-Pod P7000 in Quicksilver/Yellow Color and ** BONUS ** Tooth Tissues!,We bought 2 Go-Pods for our twin daughters when they were about 6 months and love the Go-Pods.  We really didn't start using them everyday until 7 months.  It keeps 1 baby occupied and in whatever room I am in when I change her sister.  It's also a change of scenery from crawling.  We plan on taking the Go-Pods with us when we travel next month to see my parents.  Very easy to open and close.  The girls are 9 months now and enjoy the Go-Pods even more now.  Can easily change height on them as baby grows.,5
Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace [Color: Cognac Bean / Length 12.5&quot;],"Beautiful neclace! Fits rather large on my 6 month old, but is comfortable for him. He drools a lot and gets chafed under his neck rolls so we wrap it around his wrist 3 times and it is really cute. We get tons of compliments :)",5
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,We bought this product so much cheaper online rather than at the store. It has a lot of space and it was nice to put small baby to change his diapers.,5
Baby Belt Infant Stool Backpacks And Baby Carriers Babie Seat Carrier Baby Carrier Stool Baby Product Oxford cloth Toddler belt baby summer infant belt stool Mothercare Baby Hipseat Belt Toddler Carrier Hip Seat red wine,"My son is tall and likes to be held.  this gadget allows me to carry him while I'm running errands and doing things around the house.  The little plastic stool is sturdy, but after a while it seems as if he is trying to readjust his seating, so it may not be comfortable for his butt after a while.  But who knows as he is still in the process of learning how to express himself verbally.  it still does the trick of allowing me to carry my tall baby while getting things done.",5
"Colgate Classica I Foam Crib Mattress, White","I had no idea what mattress to get, they all look the same! I thought I'd prefer a coil sprung mattress but then found that this one had won awards so got this... I'm so glad I did. It fits the crib wonderfully, and is so light which is great considering how frequently I have to change the sheets. It delivered to a military box address too which was awesome. This seems well made and like it will last.",5
"Graco Lauren Dressing Table, White","Easy to assemble. We didn't need the wheels and it looks fine with out them. Easy to assemble, sturdier than similar priced ones.",4
"Summer Infant Quickchange Portable Changing Pad, Black","We've been using this (when we are on the go) for a few months now, and it's been working great!  It's a very handy size, so it fits very well in a small diaper bag. And if it gets a little messy, it wipes right off.",5
"Skip Hop Bento Diaper Tote Bag, Black","After agonizing for months over which diaper bag to buy, I finally decided on this bag in blue/grey.  It's not perfect, but fits a fair amount and doesn't look too ""babyish"" and doesn't look like a purse, either.  I absolutely love the stroller straps.  They are EXTREMELY convenient.  I would very highly recommend buying a bag with these straps.  That was the best advice I received when setting up my registry.  This bag has lots of hidden pockets which definitely comes in handy!",4
"Sassy Baby Food Nurser, Colors May Vary",I ordered these two blue bottles because of good ratings. But did not work for us. There are too many parts to clean. I don't mind cleaning too many parts but it leaks terribly. I haven't even opened the second bottle. I am not sure I can return the second bottle since I have opened the package and used one bottle once. Dollar 6 down the drain. I would not recommend to anybody.,1

"Carters Easy Fit Jersey Crib Fitted Sheet, Pink","We needed a plain sheet as our daughter started to get too interested in the wingdings and animal shapes on her first sheets. Too much time exploring and not enough napping. This sheet solved that while at the same time being softer and warmer. Upgrade. We had no problems with shrinking or trouble fitting on the mattress (her mattress is about six inches high- maybe a taller mattress would have trouble, though there seems to be plenty of slack for a mattress two to three inches taller) and it has held up well after many washes. Getting two more so we can have some to rotate when we're washing them.",5

Safe Traffic Systems GD10201PWB Safe Rider Travel Vest Large Large 50 - 80 lb and 45 - 57 Inches - Pink,"I am writing this to respond to the rather negative review that is also placed here. We have been using one of these for over 2 years. It really isn't any harder to use than a booster seat. Our 5yo son does most of it himself now. He puts on the vest and threads the seatbelt properly on his own. He can also unbuckle himself and get out without assistance. It takes no where near """"5 minutes"""" to put on. We feel this is a great alternative to a booster seat. Please do not let 1 person who can't figure it out to dissuade you from buying it. I really do not see why this ignorant person had to go out of her way to post drivel in multiple places. I am just going to say look at the timeline s here we have used it for years and she can't figure it out in a few weeks and gets mad.",5
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","I absolutely love these bags! We bought one for our son's snack bag for preschool last year and loved it so much that we purchased one for each family member and a few of the smaller ones as well. They do shrink very slightly if you dry them in the drier, but they hold up very well.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"I bought this for my newborn grandson, and he absolutely LOVES it.  There is just enough activity for him, not so much as to over-stimulate.It's very easy to assemble, and I'd consider it one of my better purchases for my little angel.  :)",5
"Snuggin Go Infant Positioner, Black",This product did not come with instructions so I am not sure that I am using it effectively.  It seems to squish my daughter and make her more uncomfortable and I think it made her perspire.,1
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","Very attractive design. My daughter treated it like any other toys, put it into her mouth. She is barely 5 months, the rasberry is still a little big for her. It might be too early to introduce this teether.",4
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,This manual pump is great for the occasional trip away from baby. It s very small and light-weight and it works surprisingly well. I've used this pump when I am away from my son for one or two feedings and it is so easy to carry in a medium-sized purse or small bag. It only takes about 20 minutes for me to pump both sides...what a life-saver.,5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"I had received the soothing massage bouncer from Fisher Price when my son was born.  It was great for when my son needed to chill out, but there was nothing to play with.I went to a playdate at a friend's home and she had this bouncer.  I asked if my son could try it out.  He was always a kicker...even in the womb and he LOVED this in about 5 seconds.  He quickly figured out that the lights and sounds came on when he was kicking and he just kept smiling and babbling to the toys.  He loves lights and music from some of his other toys, so the fact that he was excited by this bouncer, wasn't totally surprising.I came home and told my husband how this had really caught his attention and kept him busy for quite awhile. (he is 12 weeks old and he stayed in it for 20 minutes)And the next day I went out and purchased one.  And as expected it has been a wonderful purchase and my son just loves this bouncer.I know that he is already 12 weeks old, so he won't be able to use this as long as if I had gotten it sooner, but my husband and I agreed that it was definately worth the price for his enjoyment and a great, safe place to put him to play.",5
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"Its so simple yet so effective, I would definitely recommend it. She still doesn't like but it works better than all the others I've tried.",5
CTA Digital 2-in-1 iPotty with Activity Seat for iPad,If you are seriously considering this product.

Trying handing you child one of these when they're on the potty or better yet read to them !,1
"Munchkin Mighty Grip Trainer Cup 2-Pack, 8 oz, Colors Vary",My twin girls destroy the soft spout pretty quick. That is why I rate these bottles with 3 stars.You can buy the replacement spouts on Munchkin website. They are 2.99 for a pack of 2. Hope that helps everyone out.,3
"Skip Hop 4-Piece bumper-free Crib Bedding Set, Alphabet Zoo","I am always hesitant to buy online but this was perfect!  Great quality, super cute and very comfortable materials for baby!",5
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,I love this bib! As soon as we got it the clean-up time for our little one significantly decreased! It cleans very easily in the sink and decreases laundry. The only thing that bothers me is the rubber neck strap. I have to be careful not to accidentally strap my little one's hair in it. And if I don't take the bib off when he is done he is able to pull the strap loose and throw the bib. It's only happened a couple of times though. I would still certainly buy this product again if it were to break. Pretty much I love this bib!!!,5

"JJ Cole Polar BundleMe Bunting Bag, Shadow","I just purchased this pod and was very disappointed to find that the top opening has two zippers that meat in the middle. This means every time you want to open it you must open and unhinge one zipper and open a second one... who has time for that!? Why the heck didn't they just use a single detachable zipper? Just to add insult to injury the two zippers don't touch (they are sown in far apart) and create an opening right in the middle, which is almost a square inch which will allow all the wind and cold in. I am returning it tomorrow.",2
"Fisher-Price Calming Vibrations Cuddle Soother, Blue","We use this every night to help lull our baby girl to sleep.  She absolutely loves the soothing music it plays and by the time the music stops, she's asleep.  It has become part of her bedtime routine.  We had been using it for about 3 months and out of the blue it stopped working!  NOT GOOD!  I had to listen to my baby cry herself to sleep when this happened and it broke my heart that there was nothing I could do about it!  We literally only use it once a day.  Is this normal for this toy?  FYI we replaced the batteries twice already.  You can tell when the batteries need to be replaced because the music slows down.  We never let it get too slow because it sounds pretty creepy as the music slows down, so make sure you have 3 spare AA batteries on hand for when that happens.  BTW, I called Fisher Price and their customer service is wonderful, but there is no replacement mechanism available at this time, which is a shame because the elephant itself is still like new.  Perhaps in the near future it will become available.***I was considering returning it to the store to exchange for another one and when I put the old batteries back in, it started working again.  The only explanation I have is that my husband had put rechargeable batteries in the second time we changed them because the batteries died so quickly the first time and that those batteries did something to the mechanism over the month they were in there.  It's strange because when it died I had tried to put regular batteries in and it didn't work then, so I'm really not sure what happened to the mechanism that night and if it may die again suddenly like that.  But in any case I wanted to add this bit of advice-DON'T USE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES IN THIS TOY!***",5
"Regalo Extension for Safety Gate, White, 6&quot;",I purchased this to go along with the 58&#34; wide gate because I have a 66&#34; opening. It does fit like it is suppose to but the whole assembly is wobbly. Read my other review on that if you want the whole story.,3

The First Years Ignite Stroller,"The last thing we wanted was to purchase more strollers (we already have 4). However, nothing we own was ideal for a Disney World trip with our two boys. Our Jeep Liberty stroller is awesome, but cumbersome for travel (heavy, awkward, doesn't fit regular trunk space). Our umbrella isn't comfortable for a long day, and has no storage. Our sit-and-stand won't allow our 4-year old to rest well, and is also big and heavy (especially once you add > 50 pounds of boys and your own stuff). A bigger car rental or stroller rentals cost more than purchasing two of these strollers, therefore, it was a great investment for future trips. We wanted lightweight strollers, that fold compactly to fit in a standard car rental with luggage and get on and off buses easily and have storage space for all the things you end up carrying around the airport and theme parks.My husband's big concern was weight and maneuverability. At 14 lbs, it's not bad for one-handed carrying, and our 1 1/2 year old can easily push our 4-year old throughout our house easily! Got the red stripe (best price) - I'm not a fan of red, but it is more of a ""wine"" color and is actually quite sharp. Haven't taken it out of the house yet, but the sun shade is bigger than I expected (bigger than our Jeep umbrella's). The recline seems to be good enough to keep the boys comfortable if they nap. I was able to recline it and push it back up while my 1-year old was sitting in it. He fell asleep in it while his brother was pushing him around the house. The storage is plenty for a lightweight stroller, and it's sturdy enough to hang bags off of. I read about side pockets in other reviews (which are not pictured and didn't come with them, but are apparently supposed to) - so the manufacturer is sending them out.  They're really protective fabric for the hinges, but may function like little pockets.  So they have great customer service, too! Can't wait to use them on our trip!Update: We used the strollers during Labor Day weekend at a festival and shopping. These strollers easily held a small cooler, extra clothes, our beverages, freebies/purchases, and I hung my diaper bag on the handle. My boy could even fit his little water bottle in the hinge pocket. The strollers handled well on dirt and grass, and it was nice to easily maneuver inside stores. It was even easy for one person to push both strollers! Opening and storage was a breeze. So glad we got these! The little one fell asleep comfortably. I do wish the shade was adjustable, but I'll probably just attach a bigger one.Update 2:  These were wonderful for our trip to Disney World! The cup holder and storage pockets were functional and useful. I could fit our jackets, extra clothes, etc. in the baskets. Yes, the back bars are a nuisance when you want to pull things out, but probably the only con that I can think of. I just made sure that our bags weren't large, and I hung our cooler bag on the handles for easy access.  The shade attachment worked fine on the one stroller, and I didn't find the need for my older child (since he could wear a hat/sunglasses). When they napped, we just covered them by hanging a blanket/jacket on the shade. It was so nice to move easily through the crowds. It was a lot more convenient to gate check umbrella style strollers than full-size ones.  It's nice to have a stroller that accommodates a child up to 50 pounds because the parks can wear out any child. I can't wait to use them on our next vacation.",5
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella","so i just took the car seat out of the box and loved it right away. it was light, the straps were very easy to adjust. i was kinda iffy about the pink because it looks really bright in the picture but it not even that bight in person, and the delivery was quick i got it in two days. i would recomend it or even buy another one when we get another car!!!",5
Hugamonkey Indoor Outdoor Travel Cotton Comfort Safety Newborn Infant Child Baby Sling Carrier Stone Small,"Love it.  Light, easy to use, I have purchased 3 to keep in different bags and highly recommend it.  I first used this sling on my 11lb dog and now that I have a 2 month baby, it has become an even more &#34;must&#34; in my household.",5
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","For my first child, I used a Safety 1st tub (which has its issues, too, but was for the most part pretty good).  We had to purchase a new one for our second child and this was the only brand available at the store where we did our baby shopping.I found the sling to be difficult to adjust, and it didn't seem to allow our baby to be in the water while being bathed - he was sort of suspended above it. Once he became too big for the sling, I moved him to the tub itself and found the shape of it to be completely useless.  I don't understand how the manufacturer could expect so many different sizes of babies to fit in that shape - he pushed up on the end of the tub with his feet, and it was difficult to keep a good grip on him while bathing him because the tub did nothing to help hold him up.  After a few attempts at using the tub, I threw it out and went straight to the store to get the Safety 1st tub.  Now I remember why I like it so much.",1
COZY BABY NASAL ASPIRATOR - This Snot Sucker Cleans Away Baby's Blocked Nose FAST - Its The Best Nasal Suction Tool On The Market To Relieve Blocked Nasal Congestion Quick - No Filters - Washable And Reusable - Great Baby Shower Gift - 100% Money Back Guarantee.,"I purchased this product because my precious 2 month old has had the worst congestion and runny nose! At first I was thinking how gross, sucking the snot out of the kids nose using your mouth. Ewwww... But now that I have this product it's not gross at all! It's amazing! The way it's designed the snot cannot come back up the straw so you don't have to worry about getting snot in your mouth. (Sorry so detailed) It works everytime like a charm! My baby doesn't seem to mind it at all either! Way more suction then those ball suckers cause you are the sucker. Lol :-) I will be purchasing this item for future baby shower gifts as its AMAZING!!!!",5
"Skip Hop Versa Diaper Bag, Cream Links","Love this bag - very spacious - a little larger than I thought it would be, but it looks awesome!",5
"Safety 1st Sit Booster Seat, Green",I have one for each of my girls.  They are perfect to help a toddler/young preschooler sit at the table.  The straps make it very sturdy even on stools.  Because of the plastic it is very easy to clean off and the straps can go in the wash if they get nasty.  I am so happy I didn't get the other booster seat I was looking at that cost $50 more!,5
"HALO Early Walker SleepSack Micro Fleece Wearable Blanket Pink, Large","This is perfect for keeping my daughter warm during the winter.  Its too long, despite buying the size chart recommendation so we just don't let her walk around in it.  We love it otherwise!",4
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange","I pretty much love this stroller. It's light, smooth, and super comfy for my one year old. It folds easily and locks so it doesn't come apart. The sun shade is fantastic and doubles as a wind shade and my kids love the peek-a-boo windows on the shade. There are two problems with the stroller. The basket is small and you can't get anything in there anyway. You can sort of shove a small purse, blanket or sweatshirt in from the side but that's it. No diaper bag (even a small one) or even a shopping bag at the mall (unless it's plastic). I have a hook on the handle but I usually just take only the bare essentials when I use this stroller. The other thing is that you can't stand it up when closed, it topples over. Not deal breakers but certainly things that could be improved!",4
"Embroidered Toddler Waffle Blanket - 100% Cotton - With fun Animal print - Forest Teddy, Neutral",This wonderful blanket is larger than I thought it would be - perfect for a toddler bed.  Our little love is growing and her little baby blankets don't actually cover her anymore; this blanket does.  It's light and perfect for a child during the summer or for a child who is not fond of heavy blankets.  It's super cute and I love that it's cotton.  This would make a terrific baby shower gift if you want to give a blanket.  The cotton is soft and the waffle weave is a great texture for little hands without being scratchy.  I'm very pleased!,5
'Medela 21mm Personalfit Breastshield 2-pack (Non-retail Packaging),I got this new breastshields after using the size medium which came with the pump. My nipple didn't fit like shown on the instructions. After switching milking became easier and smoother. Would have used XS if it existed.,4
The First Years Extra Tall Decor Gate,"After researching walk-thru baby gates until my head was spinning - I bought this one because they had it at my local Target and it looked cool.  So glad I got this one.  I am using it at the top of the stairs to separate two cats from two Golden Retrievers. (I know that manufacturer does not recommend this gate for the top of the stairs, but there are no children in my household.) Had hoped that the baby gate situation was temporary so we have been using a battery of 'regular' baby gates, w/ mixed results.  AND I was SICK of moving/climbing over them every time I wanted to go downstairs. After 5 months it does not appear the kiddies are all going to play nice - so I needed a better solution.  This gate is it!  My 'doorway' was exactly 36"" so I needed the gate and 2 small extenders.  At that it was still a tight fit - but it is secure!!!  I was pleased that the extenders came w/ this gate. Have seen many that charge still extra.Also the gate looks really nice.  Which is important since it appears it is going to be a permanent fixture.  I didn't want an ugly plastic one.  And I really didn't want to have to drill into my walls to mount the gate.I do wish the opening was just an inch so wider but it is certainly adequate.",4
"Board Book Albums Take Your Pix, Blue",Great baby album and the pages are easy for little ones to flip with the cutouts.  Only complaint is that the picture frame on the cover fell off and we had to glue it back it on.,4
JOTO Premium Screen Protector Film HD Ultra Clear (Invisible) for the ASUS MeMO Pad FHD 10 Inch Tablet ME302C with Lifetime Replacement Warranty (3 Pack),"Don't make the same mistake i did...buy a different brand. These are the worst screen protectors i've experienced. When you go to pull the back sheet off after you have the screen in place and bubbles removed, the screen protector would come up off of the surface of the tablet with the sheet. The product says there is a lifetime replacement, but the package the product comes in does not have the name, address or phone number of the manufacturer or distributor. On top of that, Tech Vendor says all warranty concerns need to be addressed with the manufacturer.",1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,"We bought this toy after many had told us how wonderful it was.  My daughter has laid under it since she was probably 2 mo. old.  She is currently 5 mo. old and still enjoys laying underneath it, any time now she will be able to sit up and we will change the position.  Sometimes we change the angle just a little bit and let her sit in her bouncy seat and play with it.  The toy is just so well made that just about any age/size baby can play with it.  I have nothing but good things to say about it.  Also, the sounds/voices are not annoying, they are quite nice and the low/high button is just right!  GREAT TOY!",5
Lil' Topper Sipper Caps,"This is a second set I've purchased as I have had much success with my other Lil' Topper sipper caps....in the event that I lose one, I want to be prepared!",5
"Boon Groovy + Modware Interlocking Plate and Bowl Set with Utensils,Blue/Orange","This plate and utensils are working out very well for us! The two blue dip cups are perfect for just that, and they are removable for the meals where you don't need them. They attach anywhere along the outside edge of the bigger orange plate. The two orange plates stay together, and the smaller one has deeper sides.As for the the utensils, they are shallow, which seems to be a good thing. We have a set of OXO Tot utensils that are deeper, and my young toddler usually leaves half the food on his spoon. But these he cleans with every bite. :-) The fork isn't the best for stabbing, but that's ok because it scoops just fine.The set is dishwasher safe, but not microwave safe.",5
Lambs &amp; Ivy Peek a Boo Jungle 5-pc Bedding Set,"My wife and I aren't finding out ahead of time if we're having a boy or girl, so we're trying to keep the baby room gender neutral for now. This crib bedding looks great and works perfect for either a boy or girl.",5
"aden + anais 2 Pack Muslin Burpy Bib, Princess Posie","I love all of Aden & Anais products!  They are MUST haves for baby.  I have the swaddle blankets, washcloths and burp cloths.  Love them all!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I bought this for my six month old son and he loves it. It's bright and colorful and surprisingly easy to assemble. It's great for naps or playtime!,5
Luminous Black Mini-Lantern Tea Light Holder - Baby Shower Gifts &amp; Wedding Favors,"One lantern for $15. Not a deal, maybe I didn't read the description thoroughly but, the picture led me to believe I would be getting two lanterns.  Larger, better quality candle lanterns are available in stores.  Don't waste your time.",1
"Kiddopotamus Dreamsie Sleeper with Sleeves Microfleece Large, Ivory",we tried several different kinds of sleep sacks and this one is the best.it's easy to get on - even with a wriggly baby- and it keeps our daughter toasty without getting her too hot.,5
"Skip Hop Zoo Little Kid Luggage, Dog",It is super cute and perfect for a young toddler.  It rolls nicely and is capable of holding a substantial amount of items.,5
B kids Loop Around Wrist Plush Rattle,"The wrist rattle is adorable, but my 8 month old grandson found that it was in the way, which made him frustrated. So, he just plays with it off his wrist.",3
"Britax Monarch Booster Car Seat, Royal Racer","This booster seat is one of the best we have found so far. My son is 5 and he loved the colors and the look of it. It made him feel more like he was sitting in a big boy seat. The seat belt fits snug to his body and the car seat sides really protect his head unlike several other seats we have looked at which allowed waay too much movement. My husband and I take all of our kids safety very seriously when driving and this car seat is one of the best we have found. It's a little more pricey than others out there, but when it comes to the safety aspect, it is well worth the money.",4
Sesame Street 1-2-3 Learn With Me Potty Chair -Elmo All Star,If you want to spend your time wrestling to pull a potty apart and again to put it together this is the potty for you.  This definitely was NOT designed with ease in mind.  It takes longer for me to put it back together than for my son to use it.  Hate it.  Need to buy one with and easy slide out bowl.,1
"phil&amp;teds Traveller Crib, Black","I borrowed a Traveller from a friend for an overseas trip with my 10-month old and liked it so much that I bought my own.  It's lightweight, easy to set up, packs small enough to fit into a suitcase, and definitely fills the need for a playpen/crib in a hotel room.  However, we just returned from a week-long trip, and my almost-brand new Traveller exhibited some serious quality issues.  The zipper broke on the stuff sack, the zipper came unstitched on the top panel, and one of the tightening pulls on a leg came off.  My friend's Traveller has shown none of these problems, so maybe I just got a bum one.  The Phil & Ted's warranty, though, seems much more restrictive than similar high-end producers so we'll see what they say.",3
Munchkin 3 Count Stay Put Suction Bowl,This is the worst way to spend your money. My 11 month old who was born prematurely and has the fine motor skills of a 9 month old ripped this bowl off his tray within a nano second. Lame.,1
"Delta Universal 6 Drawer Dresser, Black Cherry","Beautiful dresser, not as big as i thought and the drawers don't pull out as far as i think they should, i can see how stuff will get lost in the back of the dresser drawers. Nice for the price tho!",4
Lamaze: Pupsqueak the Puppy,"My 10 month old daughter is developmentally delayed, and it's not always easy to get her attention.  This toy, though, is sure to get her excited.  She loves to feel his crinkly ears, and bat at his jingly paws.  She flaps her arms and kicks excitedly when I squeeze his nose and he barks.  I got it for her at Christmas, and she still loves it!It is one of the best toys I've bought her, and I've bought a lot of toys.  I can't recommend it enough!",5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","My newborn daughter LOVES this mat!  The music isn't annoying, and its fun to watch your baby kick the keys and hear the music play.  The mat is also great for tummy time, just relocate the top bar to it's &#34;ground setting&#34; and the mirror can rest on it so baby can stare and entertain herself :)",5
"Urban Infant Tot Cot Daycare, Planet","I ordered three for my preschoolers and they work great, fit in a small cubby and wash well.  Although pictured with a mini frog in the pocket, the little stuffie wasn't in any of the nap sets.",4
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Miracle, Black/Silver, Cotton Mix",The Miracle series is amazing! Very easy to put on and adjust. You can adjust the back support to distribute the weight between your shoulders and hips. You can also adjust the position of the baby as he/she grows (one of the best features) I didn't think I would be impressed with baby gear but I am. Baby sits very comfortable and the mix of cotton and mesh keeps the baby from overheating. I recommend buying the bib and cover as well.,4
Just Born 4-Pack Flannel Receiving Blankets - Animal Adventure,"For the price, these are excellent receiving blankets. I just wish they were slightly larger, because my 9 week old son has already grown too big for us to swaddle using these blankets. He weighs about 11 lbs now. I still use them all the time but can't swaddle him in them anymore.",4
"Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, Red","I use this high chair in a restaurant. It is fantastic. Easy to use, easy to clean, and durable. Best one I have found",5
"Two's Company Anti-Mates Nesting Animal Dolls Set, Set of 5","Gave it to 3 year old granddaughter and she loves it. She talks to each piece as she puts them together.  No batteries, no bells and whistles, just imagination. Added bonus: doesn't take up much space.",5
Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature First Sips Weaning Cup - 4m - 5 Oz. (Pink),We bought this for our second child in hopes we could move off bottles faster. Tried it at 4 months and flow was entirely too fast. Tried again at 6 months and flow is still too fast for her. Since this is meant for beginning drinkers the flow should be regulated like a slow flow nipple.,2
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","I wanted to install this to block off my kitchen but I have curved molding at the floor line and the way this is designed, it has to be square against the wall in order to hold.  But because there are multiple widths, with additional gates, I moved it to my French door connecting my living room to my deck.  It is high enough my greyhound does not try to get over it, it is very easy to install and to open and close and it looks attractive.",5
Summer Infant Fold 'n Store Tub Time Bath Sling,"Now I feel secure to  bathe our baby !!You really think in a practical, colored, portable safetty baby product.Than you !!",5
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"Its an great item for a new born baby.If you have not bought a crib or want your baby to share the bed this is a fantastic item. Its light and portable. You can move it around the house easily and lay it down where ever.The only complaint i have is that the leg portion is fixed(yellow piece) and  the length is only 24"""". My daughter outgrew this in 5 weeks. So consider this before you buy.",4
DaVinci Alpha Mini Rocking Crib - Natural,"Baby is not here yet, so haven't tested it with the baby. Installed it myself in about an hour. Came with a 4 page manual, but the instructions for installing the crib was on one page. Read other reviews about the flimsy mattress that came with this crib, so I bought theDream On Me 3"" Spring Coil Portable Crib Mattress, White. Fits perfectly.  Now have to go by many sheets and a waterproof mattress pad.Crib is light.  Like that it had wheels.  If you don't want wheels, just take them off, and the crib becomes a ""rocker.""I do see a potential major weakness: the mattress support board.  It is a piece of thin, maybe 1/4"" MDF board, surrounded or enclosed by 4 pieces of pine wood. There's another piece of wood (2 inch X 15 inch) going across the board, acting as a brace.  If for whatever reason your child jumps up and down on the board, I think either the board will snap, crack or pop. Something to consider. I've attached images.",4
Activity Mushroom Toddler Toy,"I got this for my 9 month old for Xmas and am now regretting it. As another reviewer pointed out, there is no on/off switch or volume control. But the sound is super sensitive. It starts playing when no one's even near it (or even the same room) it even goes off in the middle of the night. So annoying!! My other big problem is that the base is not weighted. In fact the top is much heavier than the base, so every time my baby pulls up to stand to play the toy falls over. We've wedged it into a corner to keep it up and he actually does like playing with it which is the only reason for 2 stars instead of 1. Definitely would not recommend this toy to anyone, which is a bummer since it's so cute!",2
Children's Desk by P'kolino - Orange,I bought this desk on a whim because I liked the way it looks and thought it would fit perfectly in a corner of my kitchen. I was right! and thankfully it is very sturdy and looks very cute. The kids are now fighting over it which is the only down side!,5
Zoli Baby On-the-Go Snack/Formula Dispsenser - 2 oz,"I was so excited to buy this formula after my cheap Sassy one wasn't it for me.I had hoped for the Zo-Li Formula Dispenser to provide these:Formula won't spill into other compartments - CHECK!BPA free - CHECK!Hold up to 4 scoops - CHECK!Ease of use - Oops, Have to CROSS THIS OUT! There is no way to use this dispenser with one hand when baby is turning into Incredible Hulk and wants to eat NOW!Formula can flow easily without getting caught up anywhere - NOPE NOPE NOPE, you still have to shake it, swish it and tap tap tap tap to get all the formula out.So, 3 out of 5.As my title says, it's not for formula. Maybe it would be better for snacks, but that's not what I bought it for.It gets messy with the formula because in travel, the formula of course swooshes around in the individual bins, so when you unscrew each, the bottoms all have formula stuck to it. So:1) It leads to waste of formula2) It's not really very sanitary, because if you accidentally screw a bin that had been placed on a dirty table on top of another bin with formula or snack in it, then you just contaminated the formula/snack.So I'm back to my $[...] Sassy after paying $[...] w/ shipping for this. Still searching for the right formula dispenser...  I may try the Raz Pak, it looks like it's what I'm looking for. Wish me luck!",3
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush, Blue","I received this brush in the Avent starter kit at a baby shower. My initial reaction was that there must be something better since the nipple cleaner on the end serves no purpose. I was wrong. I went back to work after 3 months and continued to breastfeed until 15months. That means TONS of bottles and pump parts to hand wash each night. I became obsessed with finding a bottle brush that would last, and have a nipple cleaner on the end. It does not exist. The Avent brush is by far the best brush. The bristles are soft enough to wiggle around inside almost all of the parts, but they are also durable. At this point, my daughter is 2, and I still use the same Avent brush that came with that original kit! Of course, it gets used way less now, on sippy cups and, well, wine glasses... It works great for those too.I highly recommend this brush to anyone. Don't waste money on the other ones that last 30 days or less.",5
"NUK Large Learner Cup, 10 Ounce","If you have a child that's struggling with giving up the bottle, this is a great transition container. It feels and looks almost like a bottle and makes the adjustment a little bit easier!",4
"Medela Quick Clean Breastmilk Removal Soap, 6 Ounce","I'm reusing my medela bottles after they were in storage for two years. They always looked cloudy to me, even after sanitizing and running through the dishwasher. Now, I just soak overnight with this soap and then either rinse or use a microwave sterlizer. The bottles and pump parts look amazing- no residue at all and much easier than scrubbing. So glad I found this!",5
Sassy: Baby Food Nursers 4oz - 2pk(Green) [Baby Product],My sister used these when she had her first child and she seemed to love them. I found them more of a hassle to use. It would be easier to use a larger nipple on the bottle style you're already used (Dr Brown's size 4 or Y nipple for feeding)then to have to fool with all 5 parts and pieces of this feeder. You also have to take your time when plunging because the plate will slip sideways and you squish all the food out and it makes a huge mess.,2
Uncle Goose Chinese Character Blocks (32 pcs),"I bought these for my children, who are being brought up bilingual. These have been great. The kids are able to pair the characters with the images. I know that these will be in use for years. And they are so well made. They are expensive for what they are but I think they are worth it.",4
"Badger Basket Three Basket Set, Pink","These baskets are too cute! In the picture I thought there were a medium pink but they are more of a pastel, lighter pink in person. But, they are so cute!!! My daughter is five and we have stored her dvd's and vtech games in these on her white book case. her walls are purple and they are a great accent color. =)The Frog and the Princess Seller was great too! She has the best communication from a seller I've ever had. Answers quick and lets you know whats going on.Thanks!!!!",5
Kids II Baby Einstein Discover and Play Piano,"My 7 month old loves this piano!  The keys are soft which is something I didn't realize until after I received it, but it's very nice.",5
Cocalo Noah and Friends Window Valance,I bought two of these for the large window in my infant boys room. It goes great with the entire Cocalo Noah and Friends set. I am pleased with this purchase!,5
"The UMMY: BPA-free 100% Natural Rubber Pacifier with Round Nipple, 6-12 months","My baby is 6 months old and he's not a fan of this passifier. It looks like it may be a bit too big, as he makes a gag face when I try to give it to him.However, at this point I have not found a passifier that he will use yet and I've tried several. Hoped this would be the one.",2
8x10 BABY &amp; ME Picture &amp; Poetry Photo Gift Frame ~ Cream/Burgundy in BLACK Frame ~ Heartfelt Keepsake Picture Frame for an Expecting Mom/Mother to hold an Ultrasound/Sonogram Photo!,Basic but nice product i would recommend it.  It was a hit as a gift with nice quality paper used.,3
"HABA Pure Nature Clutching Figure, Freddie Frog","It is very cute and the material is very nice, good quality, however the frog is really tiny. I would buy it again for babies.",4
BRICA Stretch-to-Fit Window Shade,"This product, while it does offer protection from the sun, is not a great product. The suction cups do not stay suctioned to the window for long.  Needless to say we had it up in our window for maybe two full days before taking it down.  Gets frustrating having to re-suction to the window each time getting in the car.",2
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,This baby monitor does the job.  As with anything else one needs to read the instructions in order to have successful results.  I have no problems with this monitor.,5
Natural Comfort Double Electric or Battery Breast Pump,"my grandmother bought this pump for me and not wanting to hurt her feeling i made up different reasons not to use it. its very loud, it pulls too much on the nipple, and u cant get the suction right, either its too much suction or not enuff. also i never could get the dual part goin on. the bottles moved around too much i could only get one seal at a time...it usually took about 1 hr to get 6 oz.now i'm about to spend tha money on a pump in style because it is 1 of 2 pumps rated for full time pumping. ...",1
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue),"My 10 month old daughter freaked out and screamed over those bulb nose suckers. This BabyComfyNose, She looks at it inquisitively and when I get near her nose with suction started she laughs and turns away. It tickles her nose but works amazingly at drawing the snot out. When I can get her to hold her head still. Easy to clean. 6 Parts to clean with a quick hot water and soap rinse.",5
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black",Love this stroller. Perfect size and weight. MY five month old fits perfect. The right front wheel gets stuck once and awhile but thats my only compliant.,4
Sassy Wonder Wheel,"This toy is super interesting for my son, it spins for a LONG time and the noise catches his attention, but sadly the suction cup doesn't work as well as I would like. The only thing we have gotten it to stick to without popping off almost immediately is glass, like on a sliding glass door.",4
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,I love love love love love this potty! I take it with me everywhere I go! it is so compact I put it in my diaper bag! And you have to get the bags that are made for it! You get a couple (Ithink 3) when you buy the potty itself! Perfect for pottying on the go!,5
"Taggies Colours Toy, Caterpillar",I bought this for my granddaughter who is 8 months.  It is really soft and she loves to play with all the tags.,5
"Infantino Twist and Fold Activity Gym, Vintage Boy","My son, Elliott, loves this activity gym. He is three months old. I easily assembled the gym, popped it out and placed him under the hanging animals. He kicked and was so excited. I wasn't sure if he was old enough to know how to 'play' with it. But he instantly enjoyed himself. He played until he fell asleep.I am pleased with the construction of this item. It seems very well built. It folds easily for storage. Then pops right back out again easily for play time! I am super happy we found this cute durable activity gym!",5
"Graphique Home Decal, Dr. Seuss One Fish Two Fish",It is big. It is colorful and it is easy to apply and reapply!!!Several teachers have commented on how great it looks on my wall!,5
Tommee Tippee 360 Sealer Diaper Disposal System Includes 4X Refill,"We use the Tippee to dispose of our poop bags for our dog.  Instead of stinking the garbage or attracting unwanted pests, we put the poop bags in the same as a diaper.  It work great to keep the odors down and the week we ran out of refills we saw just how great a job it does at that.  However, it does go through the refills fast and they aren't cheap; plus it does tend to jam with the poop bags because they are lighter than diapers (we know its not the intended use but it does a great job none the less).  We tried other ones, but this is the best for the purpose, once we get over the sticker shock of the refills!  Would we recommend it to others for the same purpose...yes...just be prepared for some bumps in the road.",4
"Prince Lionheart Playmat Plus, ABC",This is a great mat we bought for the playroom. Vibrant colors and design and love that it's 2-sided. Best part is that it doesn't make our small playroom smell chemically or plasticky like other playmats we had. Only reason not a 5 star is bc the material isn't super smooth. It has a texture and for a small baby we have to keep his skin covered. Baby loves to touch texture witg his hands though and I'm sure it will be fine when he's older,4
Sealy Baby Soft Ultra Mattress,"We recently purchased this mattress for the 3n1 Natural Crib. No problems noted with the mattress; however, our son (who is now 6 weeks old) doesn't sleep in the crib much just yet...",4
"Kidkusion Retractable Driveway Guard, Black, 18'","This does its job, but it sags more than I was hoping. I realize we could try to take the sleeves out and put them back in the ground at an angle, but that seems like a lot of work, so we'll probably just use it like it is. I do appreciate the roll-up feature, and it makes me less worried about my little one and his toys going into the street.",4
"Gerber 4 Pack Training Pants with Seat Protector, Boy, 3T","There were only two pairs of training pants, not four, as listed.  Did not bother to return them, though, because of the headache.",1
Sassy Illumination Station,Bought this for my 3 yr. old special needs grandson (due to being 4 months premature he is both medically and physically challenged) and he absolutely loves it!!,5
BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Bassinet,Folds up really easily. Light and neat to carry. Only criticism is the mattress is pretty hard. Easily remedied by purchasing another bassinette mattress or padding it out a bit.,4
Dreambaby Under The Door Gripper,This little gadget does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It holds teh door in place.  It does not scratch floors.  It is not a fabricy item that would get dusty or catch pet hair.  It is just so simple and so effective.  It's so easy to pop it on or off when you want to move the door.,5
Baby Bling Design Company Metamorphosis All Terrain Stroller,"I have written the company twice and have not heard a response. I have owned this for just over a year, its not my primary stroller, and it is falling apart. I bought this stroller to use on my farm and to take to the beach. It performs poorly on both terrains, so much for ATS. The Wheels are completely rusted out as are the snaps that connect the fabric to the stroller so it no longer is attached, the fabric is faded and the harness has never worked, it loosens instantly and my child ends up slouching down. I have taken good care of this stroller and yet it looks as if its been sitting outside for years. Do not buy this stroller!! I wish I had bought a BOB. Im thinking of buying one now and selling the Bling but I dont think I could give it away.",1
[Award Winning] Kidsme Food Feeder (Large size),"I got a mesh version of one of these feeders from a friend, but it was a pain to clean. This one was much easier and was a great way to feed her chunks of cooked veggies or soft fruits from about 6 months to 8 months old. Now she just prefers to eat chunks of food directly.",5
Pavlov'z Toyz Electronic Interactive Activity Baby Playpen,Ordered for my grand-baby girl. She's loving to be inside - happily plays on her own with the various distractions. Think she'll enjoy it for many months to come.,5
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,My daughter is very petite so she likes to use this in the bathroom and everywhere in the house too!,5
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,"These bags are grossly off on their measurement, they are not made to handle more than 3 oz. in the freezer once you account for expansion, and they are prone to leaking.  Stick with pumping into bottles and pouring into cheaper bags, like Lanolish, Target brand, or Nuk brand.",1
"JJ Cole Collections Storage Box, Cocoa Stripe, 11&quot;","I bought three of these to use in a storage bench to store toys. They look great and seem very sturdy. I like the metal handles. We will see how they hold up to the young 'un, but I think these will last a long time.",5
"Summer Infant 2 Pack Cotton Knit Swaddleme, Safari (Small/Medium)","These are supposed to fit sizes 7-14 pounds.  My twins are just under 10 pounds and the swaddles already don't fit.  Spend a little more and go with the Halo Swaddle Sleep sacks which work well, and also offer the option of swaddling with arms in or arms out.  The Halos also are more flexible as your baby grows, because the velcro closures can be stuck anywhere on the sack.  But if you buy Halo, buy the cotton, not the fleece, unless you live in a very cold place and keep your home cool.  We found the cotton works well, even on cold nights.",1
"GustBuster Metro Manual Umbrella, Paisley","I work downtown Manhattan and was seriously searching for an umbrella that would stand up to the rain and strong winds that occur there.  I had so many broken umbrellas because (I thought) I only spent $2 on my umbrella(s) when purchased from street vendors.  I finally decided to buy a good and expensive umbrella that would finally be an umbrella I could rely on.  This umbrella broke after two uses, and it wasn't even that windy.  I hate throwing money out of the window.  Don't even think this umbrella is better than the junkie ones sold on the street corner.",1
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","This gate is the best I have ever had.  It's better than I expected.  Was easy to put up and is simple to use, just lift up on it a little bit and push or pull it open.  You can let it close on its own or make it stay open very easily.",5
"Graco Affix Highback Booster Seat with Latch System, Atomic","Nice looking, sturdy and comfortable, it has a little snack compartment on one side and also a cup holder which are but quite useful especially during longer car trips!",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Infant Starter Gift Set,"i love these bottles over the playtex ones we got for our kid, these don't leak and the price is perfect on amazon for getting this set and the other 5 bottle set as well",5
Baby Girl Bird Monthly Onesie Sticker with Chevron Pattern - Waterproof and Durable - Includes 1-12 Month Stickers,Love them!  Super cute. Everything I thought they would be and I would buy them all over again or give as a gift.,5
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"My opening is 46 1/2"" so the 48 is to big and the 42 is to small.  To solve the problem I used 1 2x4 on one side and 1 1x4 on the other side.  Using the extra boards also gave me a place to secure the know cups which keeps the knobs from walking if a dog jumps on it, without having the cups screwed into the wall.The only reason I only gave 4 out of 5 stars is the fact that the description did not let me know there could be a problem with sizes inbetween 36 and 48,  It may be workable for most sizes but not the 46 1/2'.Overall the quality is awesome, ease of opening is also great.  I will try to find a 4"" extension or even cut the 6"" down slightly and if it doesn't present any issues fitting back with the gate panel, I will trim the 12"" as well and it will make the gate fit better.Easy to put together and install.",4
Bella B No Rinse Wash,I bought this no rinse wash to use for my son who hates getting his hair wet. I wanted to use it in place of his shampoo. It is too thick and sticky to use as that purpose. I use for emergencies only.,2
"Nickelodeon Deluxe Rocking Sofa, Sponge Bob","Great quality, light weight and my kids enjoy it so much! My daughter loves to rock so this is perfect. My 7 year old son loves it too! My kids are 7 and 2 and they can sit together on it. Well worth the money and it's super cute!!",5
"Bright Starts Step Stool, Oval Color varies","I purchased this for my daughter to assist in potty training and it's just perfect! It is very sturdy and easy for her to climb up on. The rubber on top prevents her from slipping however, there are no rubber grips on the bottom. So if you are using this on a slick surface like tile or linoleum you would want to use a rug or something underneath it to prevent accidents.",4
"Evenflo Triumph 65 DLX Seat, Lincoln","Instead of having the belt in the middle of the seat (at the front bottom part), it is so helpful to have it on the side.  Having gone through several car seats, this one has been our favorite, by far.  You don't have to pump iron in order to feel like you've got the belt tight enough.",5
"Munchkin Click Lock 2 Count Sippy Cup, 9 ounce","We have been trying different cups with our 14 month old and having no success until this cup.  He took to it right away, and loves the softness of the sippy top.  The click lock feature is great for us moms of &#34;advanced maternal age&#34; because you can hear it click in an don't necessary need to see it.  There isn't a separate valve to lose, either. The cup and the lid...nothing else.  He chucked it across the room and no spill.  I'm impressed, and going back for more!",5
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Nap Mat, Pink Monkey",I purchased this for my granddaughter.  My daughter in law says that she loves the Hello Kitty mat.  I would purchase again.,5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"2003 owned it but,had no clue few years later would have other baby...I do miss and think I will get other one..it rocks them side to side which is great if you have a baby with reflux like mines does now.he was born one month ago on mothers day..may 9th 2010.The music is calming and the fishes are cute.I don't like it that is huge and takes up room..if you live in house is good but,in small apt like me is to much.",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears in Black Chambray,I love this carrier!  It was great when I ventured out to the grocery store the other day by myself.  Usually I would just take his car seat in with me and hope for the best.  We'd make it half way through the store and he would get fussy.  I'd spend the rest of the time carring him in one arm and trying to push the cart with the other.  Now I'm able to make it all the way through the store with him in his carrier.  My sholders did ache a little by the time  we were done shopping but that's to be expected when carrying a 15 lb. baby around for over an hour.,5
Infantino Right Angle Tummy Triangle,"This tummy time mat did not work for my daughter as some of the other reviewers have described.  She hated tummy time before and she screams and cries if you leave her there for more than a minute, even with re-positioning and trying to play with her using toys.  Maybe my child is just difficult but for us this did not work any better than her other tummy time mats.",3
Music Blocks Baby Maestro Opera Cartridge,This one keeps cracking us up. My two year old mimics some of the song (the chuckle part). This one is my personal favorite so far.,5
"Leachco Preggle Comfort Air-Flow Body Pillow, Ivory/Khaki",The preggle was too thick & stiff so it does not mold around your body.  Also it was hard to move when you want to switch positions while sleeping.,1
Cuddledry Cuddlemat Amazing Color Changing Bathmat for 0 to 30 Months Baby (Green),"It really does work, but the towel itself is not that big or gorgeous. Plus mine had a light coloured line through it, seems to be a permanent thing, not good enough.",3
Tuscany 6 Piece Crib Bedding Set,The Tuscany bedding set is beautiful. I love the color combinations. The bedding set looks great in our son's nursery.,5
"Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx",Love this car seat!  Very easy to adjust and make comfortable for my daughter.  Very sturdy pproduct will last my daughter for several years.,5
"Pearhead Lil' Peach Babybook, Bird",Delivered in good time and very nicely  packaged.  Daughter was thrilled....spaces for keepsakes and family info that will last forever.  nice for baby boy,5
"Boppy Newborn Lounger, Geo",I was told this was an essential item for a newborn. I agree this is an excellent product and easy to move around the house.,5
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow","They sent me the wrong color, not the one I ordered. I ordered green/yellow and they sent the ecru one, which I already have.I'm not sure if it's worth returning it for only 6 $.Probably I'm going to keep it but I'm really dissapointed.You can always buy these from Babies R Us for the same price and at least you get what you want for sure.",1
DEX Products Baby Wipes Warmer,"I did not register for this item but got it as a gift from another mom that also loved it.  I didn't really like it at first, but I had not read the directions and didn't add water.  I found that when using Pampers wipes, even with adding water, they dry out on the top.  They're just too thin.  I bought the Huggies wipes and I now love this warmer.  I have never even had to add water with these wipes.",5
"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","I cannot say enough good things about this bag. I never dreamed one bag could fit everything we needed for the twins, but this one does. It has tons of pockets that are all the right sizes and in all the right places. the charcoal/silver color is great because it's neutral so it always goes with what you are wearing and doesn't show dirt. You can't go wrong with this bag!",5
"Nuby Step Stool, Colors May Vary",This is perfect for little ones to be able to wash hands and use the potty plus just sit on when they want.  We have even used it a time or 2 ourselves,5
"BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Red","This might be one of my best purchases.  I actually got it so I would qualify for free shipping, never expecting this bib would be such a lifesaver.  The concept is pretty straightforward, and it works just like you would expect.  It catches all the stuff that doesn't quite make it from the highchair tray into the mouth, and it is fantastic for the early stages of learning to use a sippy cup.  This bib saves me from having to either let my baby eat naked or change her outfit after every meal.It's also great that you just wash the bib off in the sink, and it's ready to be used again right away.  No waiting for the washer/dryer.  I'm ordering an extra for use at grandma's house.",5
Skip Hop Zoo Backpack and Lunchie-Ladybug,It's a great little back pack and lunch bag combo my daughter loves to carry to day care every day,5
"American Baby Company Cotton Terry Contoured Changing Table Cover, Maize",I was a little disappointed when I recieved this RED bumper pad and found that the strings to tie it to the crib were WHITE. I thought I was buying a solid red pad. It looks pretty tacky in my opinion. Other than that it was fine.,3
"MAM Night Glow in the Dark Silicone Pacifier, Blue, 6 Plus Months, 2-Count","My kid has an obsession with pacifiers- will only use mams. If we try others, he freaks out. I like them too. He loves the novelty of the glow in dark.",5
"LA Baby 2&quot; Compact Crib Mattress, White","A new grandbaby meant updating the old but sturdy porta-crib I originally used with my children. Following the manufacturer's original safety specifications, I needed a new 2"" crib mattress.  Baby equipment has changed alot over the years, and I was a bit apprehensive about finding a good quality mattress with the exact length, width, and depth needed to safely update the old porta-crib. This purchase met all the specs! Upon arrival, it proved to be exactly as described, well made, and durable.  I am very pleased with this purchase, and my first grandchild is enjoying her naps as safely as her mother did when she was an infant! I loved my porta-crib when it was new and my babies were tiny - I love it more today for both its ties to the past and the precious cargo it now holds...it's good to know that some manufacturers don't require you to toss the old in favor of all things new!",5
BRICA Roll 'n Go Car Seat Transporter,"I knew when my granddaughter was going to travel , that rental car seat was not even thought of. This product is so so wonderful I wish that I had one when my 5 children where babies! I am so glad amazon offers these products to families so travel is less stress!!!! THANK YOU!",5
"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso","This crib worked out great for us. It arrived quickly and I was able to put it together with minimal help from the hubby :) It looks nice when built up and my toddler has been very content in it from the start - he only started using it at 1 year old. My only recommendations are to get some of bumper for the inside as my little one rolls around A LOT and end up on the bars. Also, to get some kind of rail covers as the first thing he did was started chewing on the rails!",4
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","This stroller is lightweight, sturdy and does its job.  My only complaint is that folding it with the hinge at the bottom back is a little harder than I'd like and I wish it could be done with the foot.",4
Kimberly Grant Spa Baby Diaper Stacker,Purchased the diaper caddy for my 2 yr old son when we were redecorating his room. He loves the colors & I love how useful it is to me. Received it in the mail rather quickly! Wonderful purchasing experience. Definitely would pirchase from seller again & recommend!,5
Baby Brezza Formula Pro One Step Food Maker,"My husband bought this for our twin newborns. They take expressed breastmilk during the day and formula at night. He thought it would save time, and it did....but, I don't think it mixed at the correct ratio. We used the correct disc that is recommended in the manual for the formula type. If I asked it to make a 4 oz bottle, it would give me 6 oz. My husband said it is because it was dispensing 4 oz of water and the addition of powder was making more formula. When I hand mix bottles by putting the water in first, then the powder, I do not end up with 2 additional ounces of formula. After 2 months the lights went crazy on it. There were either no formula amount indicator lights or every one was lit up and you never knew what the machine was set on. We were able to return the machine for a refund. Thank goodness I kept the box. Now that I am hand mixing, the babies are taking less formula, which leads me further in believing that the machine was mixing it incorrectly. It is also hard to clean. We had to clean mold out of the water tank on a regular basis, and the tank frequently smelled like burnt rubber (we assumed from the gaskets overheating).",2
"Zoli Baby Bot XL Straw Sippy Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack, Green/Pink","While these cups are pricey, they are totally worth it! My son can flip these cups any which way he wants and the straw still works!There is a bit of leakage with this cup, mostly it can be stopped by making sure the kid is flush and securely tightened, and by clearing the top of the straw.I love these cups, and am so glad they were recommended to me!",5
Trend Lab Terry Infant Robe in Blue,I bought two of these for my twin girls who are 2 1/2 months old. They are super cute! My only issue is that the material is a bit rough on the skin. I would have given this item 5 stars if the robes would have been softer.,3
"NUK Active Silicone Spout Learning Cup, Ladybug, 10-Ounce","Idea and design are good but my 18 month old can't get any water out of the firm plastic top.  I even tried and it would take an industrial vacuum to suck liquid out.  Very disappointed, especially given the other good reviews.",2
Wide Neck Baby Bottle 10 Oz. 1 Bottle,I switched my son from Avent to these bottles because of the BPA issue.  He adjusted within 2 days and now LOVES them.  They work great.  I have had no problems with the nipples.  They are really cute too and are different from anyone elses at daycare.,5
Piyo Piyo Yellow Baby Nail Scissors,Using it for my 6 month old baby's nails. Like the curvy shape and the fact that it is rounded at the top. I highly recommend it.,5
Hudson Baby Elephant Applique Fleece Blanket,"Snuggly soft! Survived a few washings so far with my new niece. I am very happy, especially for the price.",5
Lil Rinser Splashguard in Purple,16 month old recently decided she hated getting water in her face. This works great for keeping water/shampoo off her face in the tub. Took a couple of practice runs for her to get used to it.,5
Medela Tubing For Pump In Style Advanced Breast Pumps #8007214,"Arrived fast & sealed in a plastic, never been opened bag, with all the Medela stickers on it. Brand new. Very very very happy. Recommend.",5
"OXO Tot Fork and Spoon Set, Green","These are awesome, highly recommend for your little people. Quality made and they are made specifically to help your little ones keep the food on the silverware better. I'm probably going to order another set I love them so much!",5
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Walk-Thru","We used this gate outside, top of stairs, to keep dogs contained. Works well for keeping them in yard, however, I don't believe it was made to be used outdoors. If you have an outdoor area that is covered, would be great. I love the walk through gate. Easy to open and close.",3
Playtex Fridge-To-Go Bottle Holder - Double,"I breastfeed exclusively and I always had such a hard time leaving the house with a bottle of breast milk along with the capability of making another bottle. I would put the bottle in a large cup with lid filled with ice. Then I would put my breast pump in a large zip lock bag with ice so I could keep using it and carry a spare bottle to fill. Each of those items were prone to spilling so I couldn't even put them in the diaper bag. When you go on long drives pumping is the only efficient way to feed a baby. Making a stop to feed is so time consuming, but I can pump while my husband or mother is driving and I can sit in the back seat and feed the bottle while someone is driving. This Playtex case is the perfect solution. I can fit two CLASSIC GLASS NURSER EVENFLO Size: 3X4 OZ and myLansinoh Manual Breast Pump, 1-Count(not attached to the bottle) plus there is a zipper section in front for extra nipples, a pacifier, teething ring, etc... This pack keeps everything cold for a long time. I know it works for six hours and it was still very cold. It also provides a tight fit for my glass bottles so I don't have to worry about them banging around. It doesn't take up a lot of space in the feezer.",5
"Edushape 7&quot; See Me Sensory Ball, Colors May Vary",My daughter plays with these a lot while in daycare.  So we bought them for her to play at home.  We bought both the small and large size balls.  The balls are a soft flexible plastic material.  The spikes are perfect for teething and the texture helps her grab and hold on to the ball.  They're easy to push and she smacks them around and crawls behind it to do it all over again.  I gave it a 4 because the material is really soft and they deflate quicker than expected.,4
BuggyBagg Shopping Cart Cover - Single Pattern: Jungle,"I looked at several buggy covers in various price ranges.  This one was definitely worth the extra money!  It is so easy to put on.  Unlike all the others, it zippers up simply for storage and comes with its own straps so you don't have to put those yucky store ones on your baby.  The big fluffy pillow is perfect for those babies that are still wobbly but sitting up.  The colors are bright and fun for baby to look at.  All the extra compartments make this into a diaper bag if needed.  I love how much cushion is all around. It really makes baby comfortable.  So nice, even sleeping in it is easy.  I've used it in a shopping cart and on a restaurant highchair and both went on with easy.",5
Fisher-Price Private Connection Monitor with Dual Receivers - White and Grey,"I bought this monitor b/c i wanted dual receivers and it advertised a long range. The instructions inside said 400ft range however the box boasts a 900 ft range. Confusing? I can tell you that the signal is fuzzy when I'm in my driveway...directly under the baby's room! Also the battery is terrible. I can charge the battery for 8-10, use it the next day turning it on only during the baby's nap and the battery is dead by the end of the day. Finally, there is no power indicator light. You have no idea, in the dark of night or from across the room whether or not the receiver is on. I will be returning this monitor.",2
"Luvable Friends 6 Pack Washcloths, Blue","We use cloth diapers and these make great cloth wopes. They have stood up many, many washings and are still soft and grippy. Can't beat them for the price.",5
DaVinci Full/Twin Size Conversion Rail Kit - Natural,"I was thinking I would have to go purchase slats after reading some of the reviews on here, however, the rails have the normal standard lip you expect on rails and then there is a piece of wood attached that hangs over far enough that the boxsprings will not fall through...SO, you do NOT need slats!!The hardware that came with it was EXACTLY what was needed and it went together in a few minutes! (note: they use the SAME bolts and barrel locks as the mini crib so if you lose something you already have it.My 2yr old LOVES his new ""big boy"" bed!!It is also VERY sturdy! I sat on his bed last night as he went to sleep in his new bed for the first time and there were no creaks etc.!",5
"J.L. Childress 6 Bottle Cooler Tote Bag, Blue/Green","does its job.  Once he's on solids, I look forward to using the upper compartment.  I just wish it had two zippers because I'm always fumbling to see where the zipper is on this thing.",4
Motorola Additional Camera for Motorola MBP33 Baby Monitor,"Great night vision. We spent a little more to get the one that zooms and pans. Glad we did. Overall great product. It does not come with a clip, which makes it hard when walking around the house, outside or doing chores.",5
"GRACO Backless TurboBooster Car Seat, Groovy","Very well made and sturdy.  Boosts my little one perfectly and it's very very easy to put her in it.  I was looking for something to replace the ""big"" seat she had and this one looked good, especially with the ability to choose a design.  The only drawback is that I had to add extra padding because it wasn't as comfortable as her ""big"" seat.  Now, with the extra pad, it's absolutely perfect!",4
"Jaq Jaq Bird Chalk Mat, Roadway","This Chalk Mat is the perfect solution for a child in a restaurant!  It's easy to tote, as it rolls up, and doesn't take up much space.  There's a little pocket on the mat for storing chalk, so you don't have to worry about it getting loose in your purse or diaper bag.  I am so glad I bought this because my husband and I no longer have to worry about going out to eat with our son, and only getting our appetizer before there's a tantrum! The owl pattern is very cute as well! Great for ages 1 and up!",5
"Safety 1 Clic Infant Car Seat Carrier, Black","We bought this just so we could have something for the car seat - we have 2 jogging strollers so did not need the stroller that the car seat clicks onto.  We have the Safety 1st Onboard 35 - which we love.  This is lightweight, folds up small, and is easy to use and store.  It also has a sunshade that comes in really handy, as well as the 2 cup holders and storage area below.  Didn't think we would use it that much - but we really have!  We do live in a mountainous area - with dirt streets - which this is horrible on (hence the need for jogging strollers).",5
Baby Bots Changing Pad Cover,One more item for my grandson's robot nursery. It is so cute like I am sure he will be! He's due Jan1st,5
"Munchkin Click Lock Re-usable Sippy Cups, 10 Ounce, 8-Count","these are thicker than the take and toss cups, and the click lock is much nicer than having a kid pull  off the lid- which mine were starting to do. less mess with these and at about $1 a cup its not as big of a deal if they are forgotten and left somewhere. i was tired of losing me $5 a cup sippy cups.only problem is that after a month or so of use my daugter couldnt get anything out of it but i just took a needle and stuck through all the holes and problem solved.",4
"Eddie Bauer Backpack Harness, Black",Got this for our son with autism for when we went to the zoo.  It kept him within reach and out for trouble.  Highly recommend this item.,5
"Kate Aspen Be Seeing You Luggage Tag, Owl",The gift recipient was delighted with this owl luggage tag.  It was just as the seller described the item & I would recommend it as long as you are interested in owls.,4
"Mumi&amp;Bubi Solids Starter Kit, 42 x 1oz Cubes In Two Compact Baby Food Freezer Storage Trays, Plus Free e-Recipes","I LOVE these trays! They are perfect for making homemade baby food! We initially wanted to nix plastic & use stainless steel ice cube trays, but after seeing the price of one, we decided we would try this set of two for the same price instead and see how they worked out. This came as a set of two trays with lids: 21 one-ounce cubes per tray. They stack wonderfully, wash easily, & I haven't had one become odorous, mstain or discolor yet..even with beets or tomatoes! I will agree, however, with other reviewers that the cubes do not pop out easily upon initially removing them from the freezer. We simply just take them out of the freezer and either let them sit on the counter for 5 minutes or quickly dip the underside of the trays in some lukewarm water just long enough to loosen the cubes. Then they easily slide right out! Great product!",5
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Select-a-Show Soother,"This thing is so stinkin cute! I got it for my nephews 1st birthday and what a hit! My 9 month old loves it as well! I will probably buy another! It got here a week early and was perfect! This is a must have, its cute and the sounds/music arent loud and annoying every parents dream!",5
WubbaNub Yellow Duck,"I bought this for my 3 month old because I had heard great things about it from some friends. It's cute and soft and he can hold onto it, so the pacifier at least stays closer to his mouth. We have been using Nuk pacifiers, which he likes well enough and are a very different shape from the attached Soothie. If the company gave a choice of different style pacifiers, I think the product would be AWESOME. I guess it will just take some getting used to, but I think it's also a great tool for babies to figure out how to put things in their mouths. I would recommend it to a friend, especially if you're already using the Soothies.",4
FunBites Hearts - Cuts kids' food into fun-shaped bite-sized pieces . . . Great for picky eaters and bento!,"Love FunBites! My 7yr old and 4 yr old had so much fun making their own funbites! Perfect for picky eaters!Pros: Fun and easy for kids to use, creative way to get picky eaters to eat, fun shapes, good treat for special events, multi uses from food to snacks to bite size cookies, Sturdy construction, friendly customer service and different shapes to choose from.Cons: Not really a con, but I would love to see some shapes a little larger to make mini sandwiches that are a little bigger that would be perfect for lunches!",5
"Room Magic Magic Desk Hutch, Chocolate","My only problem with this was that the brackets, pictured in the instructions.  That attach the hutch to the desk were not there or in the package.",4
Baby Jogger Adjustable Belly Bar,"I have 15 month old twins, with the belly bar on, I adjusted the straps to just go across their thighs and between the crotch. they lean forward and hold the belly bar on walks. They love it, they seem to feel less restricted than being all strapped down. Of course I watch that they don't try to climb out but they are pretty content. I like the fact that it adjusts too, and it seems pretty sturdy.",5
Matte Satin Bib with Screened Cross (One Size/White),"Had this nice bib monogrammed for our grandsons baptism. Good quality, nice fabric.  The cross makes this bib very special.",5
"Fresh Baby So Easy Portion Storage Bags, 50 Count",These bags fit nicely in my side-by-side freezer. They take up much less space than a traditional freezer bag so I can fit more in a small space.  I like to keep homemade soup around for quick lunches and these are the perfect size for my family.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My son and daughter-in-law requested this item and they are very pleased with it.  For their last child they used another brand, and  were dissatisfied.  However, they love the Diaper Champ.",4
Burlington Baby Bassinet Combo with Wicker Baskets,"For the price this is the best bassinet I could find.  I am very pleased with this bassinet.  It is easy to assemble taking less than 10 minutes.  The parts are plastic, but feel very durable.  The baskets on the bottom are a nice touch.  It comes with everything you need to set up a for a boy or girl.  It has a pad in the bassinet.  You can adjust the wheels to make it a cradle.Overall 5 stars!  Thank you!",5
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,It fits the 6 inch portable crib mattress perfectly but it is not top quality sheets. After a few washes it will shrink.,3
Chicco Lil Piano Splash Walker,"This walker is easy to put together and is well made. My 6 mo. old grandson fits in it well with the walker on the lowest setting. The walker collapses flat for easy storage. The play console installs easily and takes regular batteries for the sound/light effects. Replacing the batteries should be easy and inexpensive to do. The console also snaps out easily, providing a tray for snacks, etc. The low profile of the play console allows the baby to have an unobstructed view of the room while scooting around. My grandson plays with the toys, but prefers scooting around. I think this walker will hold up sufficiently so that it can be handed down to another child.",5
Munchkin Dora the Explorer Bath Squirters,was a great christmnas girt for a dora fan arrived just in time for the holidays dispite weather and buisiness we love them and worked great to take the place of our older ones. they are kind of small t=but we like them and are happy with them and how quickly they came.,5
"Baby K'tan Breeze Baby Carrier, White, Large",I really like this carrier. It is the third one I've tried. It is very comfortable and lightweight which makes it perfect for summer. It does not hurt my back like another carrier I've tried. You can customize how its positioned easier than the more expensive carriers with buckle and straps which is why i think my back hurts less. My boyfriend thinks I'm going to drop our baby with this but it is very secure. It does move at little sometimes in some positions which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.,4
JollyPop Pacifiers PREEMIE PREMATURE BABY'S Size Pink Natural Scent,This is listed as preemie which is why I ordered it but IT IS NOT.  The package even reads 0-3 months so I don't know why it's listed under preemie.,1
Cybex 2.GO Baby Carrier - Chilli Pepper,"Here is why, 5 positions, padded seat for a child, a baby sits on his bottom on Cybex while on other carriers he sits on his crotch. That's why I returned them and kept Cybex. The head support for facing a mother position and if you want to place a baby to face out then just fold that pad down. Easy to put the baby in. The carrier expands as the baby grows by unzipping the zipper in the middle.  This Carrier is made for a baby's and a parent's comfort. The padded straps and support on the lower back and shoulders spread the weight so well you even don't feel it! Finally I can carry my son in a properly made carrier. I used others and mu child screamed in them. Then I made a research and top nine carriers included Cybex. There was  Trekker in the article too, but it is shipped from Canada so I hesitated to order Trekker because of their return policy. Try Cybex carrier and you will keep it as I did.",5
"Bibbitec Ultimate Bib Junior, 9 Months - 2 Years (Moonbeam Gray - Pink Trim)","This is perfect for my 10-month-old granddaughter who has problems with spitting up her food.  We saw this on Shark Tank and decided to give it a try, and her mom is thrilled!  Easy to clean and fits perfectly.",5
"Spill Spoiler Cap, Red/Green/Royal Blue, 3-Count",My son is low weight and the doctor has suggested Pediasure to increase his caloric intake.  These work perfectly with Pediasure bottles.  So much easier than constantly transferring into sippy cups.  The only hard part is keeping up with them.  We sometimes forget to take them off of bottles or leave them in random places.,5
"SpaSilk Washcloths, Blue, 0-36 Months, 10-Count","These washcloths are very good for babies and soft skin. For a newborn, they can be used as quick burp cloths, sponges for little baths and cleanups, and as washable baby wipes.They're very soft, and they stay fairly white over time, but the one negative is that the edges seem to curl very easily when the washcloths are dried; you can flatten them out by hand, then fold them, and they'll stay flat for a little while, but the next time they're dried, they'll curl up again. If you air dry them, they don't curl as much, but it's still an annoyance.Since all the other washcloths I've used (generic brands, mostly) have the same problem, to a greater or lesser extent, it's not a big deal. You can't really have enough washcloths for a newborn baby!",4
"Baby Jogger F.I.T. Single Jogging Stroller, Slate/Black","We received the FIT as a gift from family after our baby was born. We wanted the opportunity to go for a jog together and this allowed us to do so. We did also order the Chicco carseat adapter for it as our baby is still an infant. Once that got installed we were off and running! The stroller is extremely sturdy. I was trying to decide between the BOB and Baby Jogger. This was recommended by many and the price was much more reasonable than BOB. I do not regret it at all. I typically go for the brand and don't mind as much about price, but in this situation, I really feel like I got an outstanding stroller for half the price. The wheels are very sturdy, the shade is large and definitely keeps the sun off baby, and it moves like a dream. It truly is a one-fold design. Although bulky (all jogging strollers are), it's easy to fold up and store. My only ""complaint"" is the fact that the front wheel doesn't swivel so making turns is a tiny bit awkward. You'll figure out how to manage it though. In no way is that a deal breaker.I'd recommend it to all my mommy friends who are in the market for a jogging stroller. We use an umbrella stroller for more of the everyday stuff, but this is perfect for an active family.",5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Mittens, Natural, 0-3 Months","keeps falling off of new borns. a little too big, may be good for 3-6 month olds.... .. .. ..",2
DaVinci Sleepwell Twilight 6-Inch Ultra Firm Deluxe Crib Mattress,"It says this was the mattress I ordered (buy the Davinci crib, get this mattress with it free). However, I opened the package and aired it out in the garage without thinking. A couple months later when we were ready for the baby to sleep in it I looked and realized the mattress shown is NOT what we ordered. This one says 100% polyster. However, I got one that is 100% vinyl cover (which is being phased out due to being unsafe, leaching chemicals!)",1
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","Where to start? Not much to say since it's a trash can! The construction is a medium level plastic, which is good weight wise but a downfall in the opening mechanism department.While at work this arrived and my wife put it together. I arrived later to find her fidgeting with it for a few hours, wondering my the step on the bottom would keep losing its 'keep' with the spring like tension to open the top.  When you open it up you'll notice two rod like pieces that must seat correctly to enable the top opening correctly. They occasionally jump track and you have to open it to correct the error. The catch on the upper rod, is just a bad design. Not a deal killer, but could benefit from a more competent engineer CADing another piece entirely.However that said, this thing is a dream. Holds a lot of diapers and the zero smell. The bagging system is awesome too. I would recommend this to anyone on the fence about it.",4
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Jumperoo,"my 5 month old loves this jumperoo, the lights and songs encourage him to jump because they light up and make sounds each time he jumps and interacts with the toys! Now he is the little master of the jumperoo and doesn't want to stop jumping! Definitely one of the better jumperoos out there! I totally recommend this! :)",5
KidCo F800 Baby Food Maker and Mill - Includes Tote - Make healthy baby food!,"The picture shows a metal grate, but when the grinder arrived, the grate was white plastic and kind of flimsy. Definitely a disappointment. Also, the seal is too tight, making it really hard to push down. This may improve with use, but right now it's not at all easy to use. If I could do it over, I would buy a different product.",2
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado","This diaper pail liner is sturdy and stays on my pail very well.I have no complaints so far, and have been using it for a month now.",5
"Kid'Sleep Classic, Blue","We bought this for my daughter when we made the transition to her &#34;big girl bed&#34;. I have to say, it has saved my sanity (and my sleep!). She now knows that she can not get out of bed until the cow wakes up. This has been especially wonderful with the time change- we just set the morning time 15 min later each day for the week before the change. No getting up at 6am for mommy! I think it's totally overpriced, but worth it- my daugher loves it!",5
"DaVinci Richmond Changer Chest, Cherry","I bought two of these to use as night stands and I love them. The quality is better than I expected - good quality wood and good finish on all of the parts you see from the front (back panel is composite and the drawer wood is unfinished and the bottoms are a bit flimsy, but still very functional and about what I would expect for this price). Other reviews mentioned that the drawers were small, and that it scratched easy - I thought the drawers were fine for what I wanted it for and I haven't had any scratching issues. As for other reviews about the drawers falling apart or not sliding right, see below.I would have given this 5 stars if not for two things:1: I had to exchange one because all three drawer bottoms were broke in half (looked like a shipping problem, but why is it packed with the flimsiest piece unprotected on the outer part of the box??) That was a hassle and made me nervous about the product, but Amazon was great and replaced it quickly and the two I ended up with had no scratches or problems.2: The directions were not entirely right and there was some difficulty with building it. The pictures of the drawer slides were backwards/upside down for where they are actually supposed to go. If you've never built anything with drawer slides, that could be confusing (could also be why some say they have problems with their drawers??). The hardware itself is lightly stamped with ""R"" and ""L"" indicators, so if you buy one, use those as a guide instead of the paper printed instruction pictures. Also, the back panel did not simply screw in (the rest of the building was very simple and all the holes and screws matched up great) and I had to use a drill to pre-make the 12 or so holes to screw them into. All in all, not a big deal, but it did take longer to build them then I expected.Overall, I would recommend it highly and I would buy more of them if I had a place for them. This is a great piece, especially for the price.",4
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"I had read the reviews for this noisemaker, and had heard that somepeople had complained the volume was too soft - however, there seemed to be enough reviews to the contrary to give me the confidence to buy this.I can not stress this enough.  This. product. is. barely. audible.On it's highest volume, it's practically useless.I will be returning this immediately.",1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","As grandparents, we bought this for use at our home for our 12 month old grandson who we see almost daily. It is very simple to put together and is very secure. It seats him at just the right height and the adjustments avaIlable will enable use for well into the future. We strap it to a chair which is dedicated for his use and can even use it to seat him at the piano to tinkle the keys as well as to cut his hair. Well made, portable and excellent value for money.",5
Beco Gemini Baby Carrier - Paige,"Very useful, excellent for all ages (due to the option of using it by carring the child on the back once he/she are to heavy to carry up front). The only issue I have with this is that when carring the baby face forward the baby tends to mouth the front panel. Unfortunatly, protective inserts are sold only for the side straps and nothing for the front panel. With that in mind, this is a tiny issue and not a real problem.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this as a gift for my friend.She loves it!It is really lovely and I even want to keep it for myself:P,5
"Sassy 2 Count Grow Up Cup, Purple/Orange, 9 Ounce","I bought these cups on a whim and I LOVE them!  They don't leak, easy to suck out of, and our dishwasher safe!! I think for my next kid I will purchase the earlier cups too and use only these!",5
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"We purchased this diaper pail with our first son.  We put all poopy diapers in baggies and tie them shut before placing them in the pail, and under normal circumstances would empty it once a week without a smell in the nursury.We're going on our second baby and I was wondering if the deoderizing part of this can be replaced at all.  I haven't seen them sold anywhere.",4
"Graco SnugRide Classic Connect 30/35 Infant Car Seat Base, Silver","Well, you bought a Graco Infant car seat, then you should have one base for each car. Just to make things easier..But, if there is a next time for me, I'd not buy a Graco Infant Car Seat. The one I bought was made of velvet and my baby felt it was too warm.And the Infant Car Seat is hard to click connect. I had one from a diferent brand before and it was much easier..",3

"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Learn-to-Flush","When it's used, the potty plays music. It shorted out after a few uses. The flusher still works. My DD uses it. It's good, but not great.",3
"Bright Start Full Size Swing, Up Up &amp; Away","(DISCLOSURE: I received a free Bright Starts Up, Up & Away Plug In Sway & Swing to try and review.  My opinions are my own.)This is a decent swing.  It gives us a place to put the baby when we need to get some things done around the house.  My 5-month-old daughter enjoys sitting in it and she likes to reach up at the toys in the mobile.  We like to keep it in the kitchen, so the baby can sit and play while we eat or cook.  The swing plays nice music and I like that it sways side to side.  My daughter seems to prefer that over the swinging back and forth.The swing does have its pros and cons.  The biggest problem was the assembly.  It was somewhat difficult, with some pieces not lining up.  I had to force some pieces together.  But, once it was put together, we've been pretty pleased with it.One thing to keep in mind is this swing is huge!  It has a very large footprint.  So, if you have a small space, then this swing may not be for you.  It's almost too big for our kitchen and often someone trips over its legs.PROS:* Swings back and forth and sways side to side* Includes an AC adapter, so you save on batteries (big plus!)* Baby can face three different directions* Plays nice music and nature sounds* Lower price point than similar swings* Swing motor is quietCONS:* Difficult to put together* Large footprint* Not as soft or plush as other similar swings* Stationary mobile with hard toysOverall, the swing works well.  If you couldn't afford anything more expensive, this swing would be fine to get.",3
Prince Lionheart Original Slumber Bear with Silkie Blanket - Blue,This device had my child falling asleep after he had woken up in the middle of the night- because it's sound activated by the babies cries. I know of no other soother that you don't have to get up and turn on. The white noise sounds of the womb comforted my child and it saved me quite a bit of sleep.,5
"Skip Hop Pronto Changing Station, Metro Stripe","I ordered this as a baby shower gift for a friend and was pleased when it arrived.  It appeared to be well made, looked stylish, and will certainly be a handy item for a new mom on the go.",5
Hard Rock Cloth Diaper &amp; Laundry Detergent - Motley Clean,"I live in Northeast Ohio, the water has lots of minerals, so I purchased Hard rock.  This is a great detergent for diapers or regular baby clothes, much better than Dreft. I use it with bumgenius, fuzzibunz, prefolds, and cloth wipes. I wash the diapers twice and use a few scoops with each load and they really come clean.",5
"Gerber Birdseye Diaper Burpcloths, Pink, Girl, 4-Count","They were very thin, was disappointed. I purchased them to make burp cloths so I ended up doubling them and sewing decorative borders all the way around them. They turned out okay except I only got half as many as I thought I would",1

"Lambs &amp; Ivy Bumper, Luv Bugs","We bought most of the ""echanted forest"" series, including the bedding set, hamper and stuffed owl, but the bumper is one of our favorites.

Medela Quick Clean Micro-Steam Bags - 2 Pack,This is very convenient especially when I had to travel between homes during Chinese New Year. It is very common for people to have microwave and I can conveniently steam and clean the bottles and equipment at ease.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","My Eurobath is the only bathtub I have purchased for my daughter.  We've been using it since she was 2 weeks old, and she is now 15 months old.  The infant side provides good support and I never worried about her slipping.  The toddler side is just big enough for her to play with toys, but not so big that she is slipping and sliding.  My only warning is that it is large.  We store it the children's bathroom tub.",5
Sliding Door Locks,"I saw these at a friend's house and when my baby started opening his closet, I knew I needed to get these.  They work great!  My little one figured out quick that he can't open the door anymore and gave up.  I looked around for the best deal and found them here on Amazon.com.",4
Sugar Booger &quot;Prehistoric Pals&quot; Feeding Collection Silverware Set,"We bought this set after we got tired of using Plastic spoons that probably aren't BPA free and regular silverware wasn't small enough for our baby's mouth. These spoons were not too small and not too big and scoops up a good amount of food for us to feed our little one. The case is a nice touch, love the magnet closure that comes with it.",5
Graco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby Monitor,"We are very pleased with this monitor - and yes I believe a monitor is a must-have baby product - you will know right away when your baby cries if you put them down for a nap or down for the night and want to be another room.  The sound quality is good with this device - and we have wireless internet and live in a densely populated neighborhood.  Also, I was pleasantly suprised by the small size of both the sound monitor and the receivers.  The receiver in my kitchen takes up very little counter space, and the monitor is small enough to keep on a window sill.  I appreciate another's reviewer suggestion to get the monitor with 2 receivers (not one) if you live in a 2-story house.  I was going to buy the single receiver model, but I am glad we didn't, as I can keep one receiver upstairs in our bedroom and the other downstairs in our kitchen.  I have often taken one of the receivers outside to do some work in our backyard while our little one naps - and have been able to get work done all the while being able to respond to our baby quickly when he cries.  Overall, great product.",5
Summer Infant Little Looster,"I returned it because it is rather big, so check to see if you have enough space.  Also check the base of your toilet.  Mine was too wide and did not allow a close fit.  Also it gets in the way if an adult wants to use the toilet.  It's awkward and you have to have space to put it when you remove it.",2
Bumkins Waterproof Sleeved Bib - On-The-Go,"At 10 months, my daughter loves eating avocados and oranges :) ... the only problem is that these foods - especially oranges - really stain clothes.  I had to constantly soak every item in hot water, just to get a lighter stain.She hates bibs and would yank and pull them off constantly, so I knew I needed something different.  This sleeved bib has been amazing!  She doesn't mind wearing it all, it fits her great (with room to grow) and her clothes have stayed stain free.  The bib is very easy to clean.  It says it's machine washable, but I just wash it in the sink after each meal with a bit of dish soap and warm water and let it sit in the dishwasher to dry until the next meal time.  This bird design is really cute too!I definitely recommend these bibs and only wish I'd bought them sooner.",5
Lamaze Soft Chime Garden Musical Toy,"While I'm certain that this toy is wonderful for infants, we have found that it is also wonderful for our 3 year old daughter with Atypical Rett Syndrome.  It is soft, brightly colored, very easy to activate (only requires a light tap), and the music it plays is pleasing to the ear.  Definitely recommended.",5
Hohner / 8&quot; Toddler Rainmaker,Great toy for 9 months and up.  Once they can hold it in their hand and twist on their own.  The adults liked it as well!,5
Wrap Strap Shopping Cart Safety Strap,It works great.  I love not needing to count on the strap that is on the cart to be big enough or clean enough for my child.,5
Baby Einstein Lights and Melodies Discovery Phone,"I should've read the reviews before I purchase this product.  The sound is too low and you can barely hear it.  My son shows no interest in this toy after 30 seconds.  Don't waste your money on this, find something else!",1
"Carter's Easy Fit Printed Crib Fitted Sheet, Animal",This crib sheet is great- good quality and is lasting through many tough washings. I bought it for my daughter since we have so many boy themed sheets. My only issue is that I bought two- different patterns from the same listing but one order got canceled.,5
"Cosco Juvenile Funsport Play Yard, Kontiki",I would recommend this play yard. It was easy to use. The directions are right on it. My little girl did just fine in it.,5
"Delta Universal 6 Drawer Dresser, Black Cherry","I was looking for a dresser, not specifically one for a nursery as I dont have kids but this dresser is similar sized to other ""adult"" dressers...so I can't speak about its merits in a nursery but from what I can tell, its a great dresser period.Flat pack furniture is normally particle board and other laminated garbage. This piece is 99% solid wood. Drawer bottoms and the back cover are particle board/cardboard but its acceptable as each drawer has a solid wood support going down the middle. Its very sturdy, pretty tall and looks great in espresso (also cheaper in that color too). The drawers are on metal rails w/ wheels, no cheap plastic, and slide great. Anyone looking for a well built dresser should look no further. Compared to other ~$200 dressers, this is MUCH better and should last MUCH longer.I've never been impressed with flat-pack furniture until this. Completely excellent. Great for anyone looking for a good dresser.To top it off, assembly was not complicated, time consuming but not complicated. Directions are pretty easy to follow and everything fits perfectly.For what its worth. This product would be immensely more popular if it wasnt in the ""baby"" section of amazon. This is a quality piece of furniture.",5
"Munchkin Mighty Grip Flip Straw Cups 2-Pack, 10- Ounce (Colors Vary)","I have both the Combi Mug Step 3 and the Munchkin Mighty Grip Flip Straw Sippy. My 18-month-old only drinks from the Munchkin. I much prefer the Munchkin because it's easier to wash (I used my Dr. Brown tiny brush to clean the straw). Other than the straw the Munchkin does not have soft rubber parts where mold grows, like the Combi does. It takes more effort to suck as other reviewers indicated, but my kid is fine with it. In fact he gets excited when after Mommy takes a big sip the cup makes a sound (air going through the valve.) I used that trick often to get him to drink water. I haven't encounter the problem of leaking in my Munchkin.",5
ReSqueeze Reusable Food Pouch (4-pack),Save me money.... my son 1 years old love his yogurt and he's always on the move that he learn to walk...so now I just buy the larger container of yogurt (cheaper than the small cups and factory pouches of yogurts) fill these reusable pouches and give it to him rather then spoon feed him out of the cup. I find useing the baby bottle brushes as the best was to clean these,5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","The versatility of this toy makes it a lot of fun. The kids really get a kick out of the piano. When they start sitting up, they can play the piano with their hands (not like a real piano of course, the ""keys"" are pretty large). Great idea for a toy, and it's lasted through two kids.",5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I'll say one good thing about this product: it's easy to use. For a while it seemed to control odor fairly well, but as my daughter got older and her waste got smellier, the Diaper Dekor showed its weakness. Her whole room smells like an outhouse. I've had enough, and am moving on to another product.",1
"Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Black","It is practical, comfortable and durable. Quality is optimal. long time that I have the product and I have no complaints except for the size which can be small for more than one child.",4
Custom Baby Girl Boutique - Safari 13 PCS Crib Bedding,"This set is awesome. I got it early even with my monogrammed pillow. I really like that the two pillow cases are removable to wash. The purple is a nice true shade, the zebra stripes are chocolate brown though-not black-but I love it. There were a few loose strings in the stitching but a few quick snips with scissors fixed that. I washed it before I put it on and it didn't fade at all. The diaper holder is a little small though. I wanted this but it originally out of stock when i tried to order it so I go the Cocalo Jacana set instead but this came back in stock so I quickly returned that and got this! If you are interested in the Jacana set I would go with this one! The Jacana set is not really purple it's more pinkish and it's very lightly colored, this one is very vibrant with a true purple and you get way more for your money. Plus, you can monogram a the square pillow for free! A great buy!",5
"Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer Bags, 6 Pack, White","In theory, this works great for sanitizing your pump parts, however, it fried my tubing. I followed the instructions but it still fried my tubing. I'm apprehensive to use it with the rest of my parts.",3
"Excellante' Wooden High Chair, Walnut (Packaging May Vary)","Obviously this has not always been the case by the reviews I'm reading, but the current shipments of these high chairs are arriving with the belts stuck to the seat of the chair (the belts were attached and allowed to stick to the lacquer as it dried in manufacture). The quality control on this product is horrendous to have allowed so many units to be affected, but then again, this item is made in China (despite being made of eco-friendly Rubberwood, which is the reason we chose it). Sadly, there is no way for them to send us an unaffected unit at this time, we are really unhappy about this product situation.",1
BabyMoon Pod - For Head Support &amp; Neck Support (Blue),"My baby is starting to have a flat head so this had good reviews. I liked the pictures on the back of the package, which showed proper use. I think it has helped. I like the soft material and the pillow keeps its shape.",4

Tiny Love Tiny Princess Mobile,"Our daughter absolutely adores this mobile!! She coos and smiles at it and gets so excited when we turn it on. We also use the music to soothe her to sleep at night.  We also had a similar one by Tiny Love for our son who is now 15 months old and we still use the  music to soothe him when he is having trouble sleeping, Great purchase!",5
"Regalo Easy Step Extra Wide Walk Thru Gate, White",Overall the gate does what it's supposed to and keeps kids/pets in and out of places. If you need to use the included extenders they aren't flush and tight with the gate and wobble even when pressure mounted to the wall.,3
Mobi Glomate Junior,"I have every kind of tap light for my little one who wakes up and needs a night light. Problem is, they don't auto shut off but this light turns on and goes off after 15 minutes on an internal timer. I have had the same batteries in it for at least a month and haven't had to change them yet! The exterior is smooth plastic but the edges are all round. It's pretty easy to use, but the buttons are on the bottom side and don't light up so its hard to see the power button in the dark. It has been dropped but we have carpet on the floor so I didn't have any issues. It works every night and I never have to change the batteries. We are very happy with the Mobi night light and would recommend it. It's a reliable quality product.",5

Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"while the seat itself is very attractive i found the belt system to be really weird. the crotch part is nice and wide but super long and elastic which allowed my wiggly son to slide down so far that his ankles were hanging off the edge. i suppose its designed for chubbier babies than my own. on the up side, the vibration and music combo was a big hit me. it folds completely flat and doesnt turn itself off for nearly 20 minutes.",3

Skip Hop Alphabet Zoo Mega Play Mat,"Okay, so I have no one to blame but myself for washing and drying it in my machines. But I have done it before with no issue. This last time, however, the back of the mat actually melted, rendering it useless and I had to throw it away. Until that point, I really liked it.Not sure whether to buy it again and be more careful or just get a new one.Just a word of warning that when it tells you to line dry, you better line dry it!",3
"Carters Wrap Me Up Receiving Blanket, 4 Pack, Green",these are large swaddle blankets 30X40 that can comfortably swaddle your baby and have lasted me till my baby has outgrown it . even after that I have used it as a towel for the belay as it is really soft. highly recommend it.,5

Summer Infant Baby Touch Boost Digital Color Video Monitor,"We had to purchase a the new &#34;Boost&#34; version of this product when our first generation Baby Touch stopped working (just slightly after the 1 year warrantee... great).  This new &#34;version&#34; is terrible.  The screen is more difficult to navigate when switching between multiple cameras and the &#34;touch&#34; is not very sensitive at all.  It's clumsy and annoying.  So, the &#34;improvements&#34; that they have made are not really improvements at all.What's worse is that the previous monitor had fantastic range.  We could use it all over our 3 story house.  This new monitor constantly goes &#34;out of range&#34; when you are not on the actual floor or right below the camera in use.  This renders it pretty much useless.And the seller has been less than helpful with these issues.  I have had to ask Amazon to file a claim to be able to return this ineffective set of cameras/monitors.",1
"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large","I sent this to my 3 year old grandson who loves to push things and ride things around the house.  He can be found pushing it around like a shopping cart, riding it facing forwards or backwards, lying across it, and using it as a chair next to a small table.  He loves it!  My daughter likes it because the wheels go smoothly over carpet, wood and tile surfaces, no scratching.  She says that it is made very well, the material of the seat is soft and easy to wipe clean, and it is not overly large and bulky (can be tucked away in a closet).  My grandson enjoyed his so much that I got a second one (smaller ladybug version) for my 1 year old granddaughter.",5
"Karibu Baby Folding Bath, Blue/White","I got that for my sphynx cat, and we love it!  When we are done it fold and I put way, not taking a lot space !!!",5
"KidKusion Banister Guard, Clear","This product ships with a rolled up piece of clear plastic, some 8-inch white zip ties, a hole punch, and some screws and anchors. You cut the plastic to the size of your railing (they recommend scissors but I used a utility knife to get a straight, smooth cut), punch or drill holes and put screws or zip ties to secure it.The good:fairly easy and simple to installzip ties make installation temporary and generally leave the railing undamaged when you remove it (expect some wear around the zip ties)plastic is clear, so minimal visual impactfeels secure and safeThe bad:zip ties are a little short to get around some banisters, you can link them together to get more length (but then you might need to buy more)plastic is stiff enough to be really annoying trying to get it up against the banister for installation; the plastic keeps wanting to roll back upnoisy when the kid bangs on itplastic can &#34;crease&#34; leaving ugly white marks in the clear film (so be careful not to &#34;fold&#34; the plastic during installation)Overall, this is a satisfying product that makes me feel safe. My older house had the rungs in the upstairs railing too far apart, so this product worked very well to make the railing safe for my infant and toddler. My toddler loves to run up to it and go bang, bang, bang... the first bang always alarms us, but once we realize what he's doing we are confident he's safe. I removed one star just for the difficulty during installation keeping the plastic unrolled and lined up. Careful measurements and good planning will make installation easier and leave you with a good-looking, safe product.",4

"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Kristy","For the price of this carseat I truly was not expecting alot, but I went ahead and purchased it based on the positive reviews.  It does not have a ton of padding, but its roomy and my son seems comfortable in it.  The highsides make it a lil tough for me to lift him up and into it (I drive a full size pickup) so I typically try and find a curb!  =  I think for the price, this is a great purchase.  I would recommend it to a friend.",4
"Snuggin Go Therapeutic Infant Seating Support, Black",This is perfect for my special needs child!  He has transitioned from his infant carseat/stroller to a big boy one.  He has hydrocephalus & lacks head/trunk control still at 1 year old.  This works great in his stroller for additional support!  Wish I would've known about these--and the tortacolis kit--a lot sooner!,5
"Mimijumi 8 Ounce Baby Bottle, Very Hungry","I like that this is simple to wash and it has a nice, wide area for my baby to eat from...but she downs the milk way too fast because there is nothing to slow the flow. I much prefer the Breastflow bottles because they mimic the breast better and slow the flow of milk, so she doesn't spit so much of it back up,",3
Munchie Mug - Top Rated Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Ages 1 to 4 years. Made in AMERICA. - BPA and phthalate free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top,"I don't normally write reviews but this is a great item. My 16 month old loves this..she won't even let go sometimes.  its soft cloth cover makes it easy for kids to put their hands inside the cup without hurting themselves (unlike the munchkin one, it is just too hard). Overall, its a great snack cup for home, car, etc.",5
"DK Leigh Crib Nursery Bedding Set, Distinctive Cupcake Baby, 10 Piece",This bedding is better in person. The colors are bold and not pastel like other bedding. I am baker and this was the cutest cupcake bedding I could find. Fabrics are soft too. Looks great with my black crib. Would recommend this item to anyone looking for something girly but NOT PINK! Can't wait to put my baby girl in this crib.,5
"The First Years Compass Pathway B570 Adjustable Booster Seat, Black and Khaki","Update 10-2-10: I use this in my older Audi, which doesn't have latch attachments in the seat. It constantly falls over when I go around a corner. I would recommend keeping the seat belt over it to prevent this from happening.The Pathway B570 is a belt booster. There is no 5-point harness. It does have a pathway for the belt to follow, which makes it easier for my kids to put the seatbelt on. It has removable cup holders, unfortunately, they do not lock in fully, and by that I mean if you turn it half way it stays in, but keep turning and it will unlock. My kids had a bit of trouble with that, and they are easily loosened. The armrests fold up nicely, incase you need a little extra room. This is helpful if an adult will be sitting next to the seat (though it will still be a bit cramped). The color is nice, but it gets hot fast in the sun. The fabric is not that soft and my kids found it less comfortable.....let me mention that I am comparing this to the Britax Frontier. We have one for each child. It is more solid, softer, and has a 5-point harness. For us, the 5-point harness is key, and while the Britax is more than twice the price, I wouldn't trade it for long distance/highway driving. Back to the Pathway.....I use it in my car for when I have to take one of my kids around locally, and it works well. One annoyance, and it goes for any belt booster is when one of my children fall asleep in the car, the belt does not give them the same support that the 5 point harness gives. I try to use this (and our other boosters) strictly for local driving and when I do not think they will fall asleep. The Pathway folds nicely and stays folded, though opening it at first I thought I was going to break it because I had to use a lot of force to open it. Once folded, it is not the easy to carry, and can be a bit awkward. Also, it is heavy. This is not a bad thing, because it is a solid booster.....it just makes it harder to carry around. It fits easily in my trunk, and because it folds, stowing it is simple....in fact, I think it could fit in a plane overhead compartment. This is great if you are traveling and want to bring a good booster with you. Again, the weight is the only issue, as you will have to lug it around the airport if you do not check it. With the cost of renting a car seat from the car rental company's, bringing this along is worth it! Over all, this fits between a regular sit-on type booster seat that has no back, and the full blown, 5-point harness seat. The seat back does extend up to grow with your child. I am happy with this, and if I didn't know about the Britax, I would be thrilled with the Pathway.....I am still happy with it, and believe it does serve a purpose, but I will continue to use it as I have mentioned. I should note that last year I tried a different 5-point harness (I do not remember the brand) and returned it because it was junk, and the only one that met our expectations/standards was the Frontier. Please note this does not take away from the Pathway, I am merely trying to show you my point of reference. For the price, the Pathway has good features and good value.",3
"South Shore Savannah Collection 4-Drawer Chest, White",This is a great sturdy chest! It does come in lots of pieces but it's step by step manual makes it simple to put together! It took us about 45 minutes to assemble! It's made from strong wood and the drawers are spacious! I love it,5

Aqueduck Faucet Handle Extender,"Perfect for my kiddos! This arrived yesterday and the kids love it.Having a step stool next to the sink enabled them to reach the sink basin, but they still couldn't reach the water or faucet. The extender fits tight with a squishy sponge material that grips the handle. A screw piece clamps the two sides together. The screw piece felt a little flimsy so I tightened only until it felt like it wouldn't fall off. I didn't want to over tighten it and break it.I bought this in combination with the faucet extender and now my 2.5 year old is pretty self sufficient in the bathroom.",5
Medela Value Pack Bpa-free Feeding Gift Set : New Wide Base Nipple,"My breast milk is taking a little bit to come in so I have been having to use the Medela bottle set that I bought to go with my breast pump. My daughter now doesn't want to breast feed because it is to easy for her with the nipples on these bottles.  They flow SUPER fast.  So much so that when I lean them down to her mouth they leak on her or her clothing.  We went out tonight and bought the Dr. Brown's bottles because they are listed in """"Parenting"""" magazine as the best newborn bottle for your money.  I will be trying them with her next bottle because these Madela are going in the the local shelter because I can't use them.",1
"Bumble Bags Toddler Car Seat Cover, Starry Sky",ONLY WISH IT HAD A SPACE FOR THE PULL TIGHTENER ON THE GRECO SO IT WOULD BE EASIER TO TIGHTEN STRAPS BUT STILL GREAT.,4
(100-Pack) U-Fill Snack Pack Reusable Refillable Baby Food Pouch,"I love the idea that I can make my own food and put it in an travel pouch. Most of the ones with meat or vegetables are so expensive, this way I know what I am feeding my daughter and It's way cheaper in the long run.",5
"Inglesina Fast Table Chair, Black",We couldn't get our little one to sit in a highchair. He always wanted to be at the table with us like his big brother. We needed something that didn't require a huge overhang and this product works perfectly. We bring it traveling as well. Very easy to fold. And it has great padding! Very comfy for the kids. I've washed the fabric in the washing machine a bunch if times now and always comes out perfect. No shrinking or fading. We use the summer infant tray to catch the food between the table to chair space and it works great. Saw suggestion in another review. The mat doesn't lay perfectly flat but it works and is easy to clean.,5
"NoJo Froggy Friends Musical Mobile, Brown/Green","My 2 month old loves to watch this mobile.  The music is fine, mine has one off key note. The plastic part came a little scuffed up but that gets covered with cloth anyway.  The screw in part to secure it to the bed didn't fit right so I sorta had to jam it in.  I don't move it around so that's not much of a problem once it's in place.  Other than that the mobile is great.  Baby loves it and that's what matters.  Well it's a wind up, so get used to sitting there with baby.",4
"Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake, Year-Round","Like the title says, this item was kind of hard to get a good hand impression on but on the plus side, it was easily moldable so we could try fifty million times if we needed to, lol. It's a foam-type material, which surprised me, and because it was hard to get a good impression, we had to make it thicker, thus unable to use the star shaped mold. I really don't think we could have gotten a good impression by making the foam as thin as needed for the mold.",3
Sassy Crib and Floor Mirror,It's cute and my kid likes it. Just not sure if it's a knock-off...it doesn't look like the picture here on Amazon.com and the bee is upside down...,3
Disney Toy Story Hide and Sneak 4 Piece Toddler Set,"I bought this bedding for my toddler for Christmas, and was fully expecting thin, cheap, uncomfortable material that usually comes from this type of product. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised. The bedding is actually very soft, even if it is a little thin. The colors are bright and filled with my son's favorite Toy Story characters. As soon as it was on his bed he jumped right in and sat there naming all the characters. The comforter is also reversible, just in case he changes his mind about Buzz and Woody. This bedding is definitely a great buy for little Toy Story fans.",4
"Frenchie Mother Towel, Yellow","OK I LOVE this towel! i only rated it as a 4 because the price is ridiculous! other than that though seriously every mom should have one and the color (Yellow) is super cute as is the binding around the edge (yellow with a brown """"leaf-ish"""" pattern)",4
"Green to Grow Mellow Colic-Relief Wide Neck Baby Bottle, 5 Ounce","These bottles are really cute and seem to be well made. Unfortunately they did not work very well at all for my son. He has more spit up with these. For being a 'wide neck' bottle, they are not very wide at all. I wish the nipple was wider. The nipple is also very fast flowing for a 'slow flow' nipple. My son was very messy while eating from these. The website suggests using a slow flow Nuk nipple, but those were too slow for us. I wish it would have worked out for us, especially after spending so much on this brand.",3
"The Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Aqua Stripe)","I'm a keen 1st time Swaddler, as Hospital & Mum showed me, Ive tried all sorts, & as a newborn a cellular blanket was fine, then the Summer 'Swaddle me' was fine till 3 months, then problems started, he was strong enough to break free, & I didn't like the idea of him strapped up for 12 hrs daily! this is not good for his motor & coordination movements etc, I was having a nightmare, adding extra velcro & sewing bits up... Tried the Woombie & he loves it, he now stops the horrid grunting noise that occured while in the velcro swaddle & actually smiles as soon as I zip him into the Woombie. It took a few naps & a night to adjust to the extra bit of freedom, & he can now just reach fingers into his mouth, to self soothe, SO HAVE DITCHED THE DUMMY, HOORAY...SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT EVERY NIGHT SINCE.",5
BEABA First Stage Spoon Multi-Pack - Multicolor - 4 pk,"Yes the silicone does stain eventually, but everything else makes these a keeper.  They are soft and shallow for my beginner eater.  He chews on them when we are done eating.  Have added them to my must have baby gift list.",5

Spectra Baby USA Silicone Massager for Dew 350 and Spectra 9 Breast Pumps,I ordered the massagers even though they were not recommended for Spectra S2 but I was very pleased when I received them along with the pump and they fit perfectly well! So ladies they do work just fine with the Spectra S2 as well :),5
"Medela Contact Nipple Shield, Small",I brought these shields and used it all of 2 times because of sore nipples. But I found hot compresses and the ointment work the best. I haven't used them since and now I don't need them.,2
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","This looks ridiculous, I realize, but after pumping without it for about a week and a half and having to hold the bottles in hand, I recognized the benefits of this bra. Hands free pumping is ideal and so helpful when you have a million other things to do. I would, and have, recommended this to several pregnant friends who plan to breastfeed.",5
OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack (White),Great alternative to baby wipes. Eco friendly and safe for baby's skin.  They also wash nicely and are well made.  We have been using them for 4 months without having to replace them and they still look fairly new.,5
"3 Sprouts Wall Organizer, Crocodile","My daughter love love loves flamingos. We hung this at her height and she uses it all the time to put her treasures out of baby brother's reach (in the top pocket, anyway). The lower pockets she puts books and things that he is allowed to share.This is really well made with a heavy canvas and the flamingo itself is darling. I can see it lasting for years to come.",5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink",It does what it says it will do.  Holds hot food or cold.  I didn't purchase this for a child but for myself and I'm a 59 year old female.  The led is perfect and not difficult to open.  I have lost some strength in my hands and yet I can open it without a problem.  Who can ask for more!,5

Once I realized that pak n' play mattresses exist I got one right away and ordered the sheets after looking at the reviews. I absolutely love it. It fits tightly, are super soft and there isn't much difference if any after washing and drying. I would recommend these sheets to anyone and will be purchasing more! btw the mattress is a 'Dream on me' 3''.",5
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Tyrannosaurus","We owned two of the older model (an owl and a t-rex).  The owl is still working, but the t-rex finally went out after two years plus+.  I decided to replace it.  I was pleased when the new one arrived, it was bigger brighter and the charging stand looked better.  However, it would constantly flicker like it was shorting out when on the stand, then wouldn't hold a charge.  Basically you had to leave it on the stand all the time.  The light would be green on the stand, but kind of flickering, undock revealed no charge, re-dock and the light turned red.  I returned it, received a replacement from Amazon, and the replacement has the same issue.  This one is going back for a refund.  Disappointing.  All this circa March - April 2011.",1
BubuBibi Wet/Dry Bag Cloth Diaper/Swim Soft MINKY PINK (21&quot;X14&quot;),"Nice and big enough for my suit, and my kids' suits.  We transport wet things home it this, and then turn the bag inside-out to dry before we use it again. So far we have had no problems with the bag...but I have not washed-it and am not sure how that might effect it's effectiveness.",5
Yookidoo Stack 'N' Spray Tub Fountain,"I bought this toy recently from a store that my 1 year old daughter had a gift card from since Christmas.  It was pricier at that store and I would have bought it from Amazon had a not had a gift card.  This toy is so much fun...my daughter loves it and laughs hysterically with all the ways the water squirts out.  There is no wrong way to stack the parts so it makes it so easy for her to play with and I am sure she will enjoy it for years to come.  The only thing is because we don't put her water too high, we can't use the attachment that keeps it in place...so it floats around...but I think that makes it more fun anyway...After reading the other reviews about the battery compartment problems, I am going to double check ours (as we've only used it twice)...but so far so good!",5
"Munchkin Portable Diaper Caddy, Blue",This portable diaper caddy is small so you can keep it almost anywhere.  It is well made and super cute.,5
Kidswitch Light Switch Extender- 3 Pack,"The idea is excellent.  We failed to realize, though, our light switches are all placed rather high on our walls.  Our tall 2 year old is still at least 3 inches from touching the bottom of the star....  our home is circa 1920's which may have something to do with the switch placement.  Not sure.....",3
Munchkin Sesame Street Fresh Food Feeder,"Love this because had the  elmo face on it. First one i brought with face on it. This was for my grandson, wish they had this one when my  kids was little.

"Safety 1st Aerolite Deluxe Stroller, Silver Leaf","We bought this stroller to ""upgrade"" from the safety 1st jaunt travel system.The GOODThe slidegaurd, which keeps a child's head from getting caught between the tray if they happen to undo thier buckle.The fold is easy to doEven though it's not a all terrain stroller, it works well over gravel, grass and dirtThe canopy is unlike any other it gives you the option of sheilding from the sun while having a nice brezze come through the mesh opening, howeverdoesn't help when it rains, even when buttoned up.The BADAfter using this stroller for about a month (I used it almost everyday & sometimes through gravel/bumpy sidewalks) it would squeak even after using WD-40The wheels would stop rolling after going over a bumpThe seat back was hard, no cushion what so ever, but if you happen to have a extra car seat or highchair padding around you could use that, which is what I ended up doing.The storage basket is at a angle to if your doing lots of shopping be sure to put your heavy items in front and small in the back otherwise the heavy item will just keep sliding towards the front.The cup holder on the parents tray are short, any slight bump i would go over and my water bottle will fall out rolling down the street.Overall for the price now (we paid over $150 through here) I would say it's worth if you don't mind the bad, although I think they should of added the car seat with it. When connected and all canopys are closed it makes a nice sheild from looky loos. Also there is no front wheel lock to make it a fixed /swivel stroller.",3
Baby Abc Pastel Quilt,"The quality and size of this are definitely lacking given the cost of the quilt.  Definitely shop around, much smaller than you think.",1
KAYSCASE Premium HD Bubble Free Tampered Glass Screen Protector 0.33mm Super Thin for iPhone 5 / iPhone 5S / iPhone 5C,it looks really good. it doesn't make the screen blurry like other screen protectors and so far I haven't seen any scratches so I'm pretty much happy with my purchase.,5
"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear",These are fantastic.  You will not be disappointed with their ability to stay sealed.  Definately the best I have come across.  The lids are sometimes difficult to dry out fully. But I didn't see it as a problem.,5
Fisher-Price On-the-Go Placemat,"I have been searching for items on the net to purchase that will allow my son NOT to throw his plate on the floor.  I purchased all different kinds of products/brands, and nothing has worked at this point.  The suction cups on the bottom of ALL the items/brands I have bought, don't work.  There is just not enough suction behind them.  I would apply pressure, wetness, you name it, and nothing worked.  After about 3 minutes, the product would unstick itself and the plate/bowls/cups were tossed.  This product here is a waste of money and your time spent returning it...TRUST me!",1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","It is a good toy. I rated 4 stars because the yellow color is not bright enough but Blue and Green work very well. My daughter loves it. Every night, she has to turn on and pick the color that she likes for each night before she fall asleep.  And the 45 min timer is great.Highly recommend to buy it....",4
Bumbleride Indie Twin Stroller - Green Papyrus,"The reason I didn't like the bumble ride  stroller is, because it is not useful for new born twins. It says it is comparable with greco car seats but what it clearly doesn't explain is how many car seat. It only can fit one car seat. So for 8 weeks twins, I have to wait six month to be able to use it. Even that might not gone happen since my twin are premieIt will be very useful for family that have kids with different age ..",2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","In a family with over thirty first cousins, you end up having lots of kids running around needing presents. For some reason, this Constellation Night Light turtle was a HUGE hit with the kids.I have purchased four of these turtles so far in the last two years, and the children always love them. While I'm unsure about the soft plushiness combined with the plastic shell and a light source inside, the kids don't seem to mind and actually enjoy the turtle lying around their room at night, shining lights up onto the ceiling.If you've got small kids who are fussy at night, give this a shot. You might find that you'll be buying yourself one - or at least sneaking it into your room once in a while.",4
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,"I really like this cover. It's very pretty and it folds up small to fit in my diaper bag. I love the hoop at the top to be able to see down to your baby. Using a blanket is awful compared to one of these. I also love the terry cloth pocket in the corner to hold your nursing pad or wipe up messes.That said, it seems a bit expensive for what it is, and the &#34;multi-use!&#34; claims above make me roll my eyes. No, it can't double as a blanket, it's way too thin for that. (Which is nice so your baby doesn't get hot while nursing.) I'm deducting a star for what feels like too high of a cost, but other than that it's a good cover and I'd buy it again if something ever happened to this one.",4
"Dream On Me 2 in 1 Portable Folding Stationary Side Crib, Cherry","This is a great product, However, it is poorly made and the instructions are impossible to decipher. Where it calls for assembly the holes are in the wrong places and not drilled to the proper depth. This is a shame because once we disregarded the instructions and finally got it together it was a great product and just what we wanted.",3
White Knob Lock - 2 Pieces,Great for baby proofing. These are probably my favorite after trying several different kinds. Fairly easy to use and keeps the little ones from escaping or opening doors and tumbling down stairs. Would buy again.,5
"Dreambaby Manicure Set, Blue/yellow","I like the scissors and the clippers, both work well.  The emery boards are way to rough, instead of being a fine grain for baby nails.",5
"Bummis Super Brite Diaper Cover, Pink, 8-16 Pounds","This is a great cover made in Canada. Bought a couple, then went ahead and ordered more in larger sizes. This cover does the job it is meant to do. Gussets help keep leaks contained.  The print is cute and gender neutral.  I just fold prefolds and lay them in the center; it is really that easy. They aren't stiff or crinkly once you break them in.  The only downside is velcro. Velcro is great because it gives you a very good fit in the waist so you don't have a cover falling off or cutting into the baby belly. But all velcro will fail in time and this one is no exception.  It might take hundreds of washed but eventually the velcro will lose the stickiness. I have covers that are this way and I still use them in a pinch with a onsie to help keep them in place. These do have laundry tabs and that is helpful. This is just the nature of velcro and I do not blame Bummis.",4
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","We bought two for a one and two year old knowing it will be the last car seat we ever buy.Solid, safe and portable - we just flew 12 hours to New Zealand and they sat in them on the plane as well for a comfortable flight.  Folded down reasonable flat and we were able to stack them on a trolley along with all our other suitcases.",5

"aden + anais 2 Pack Muslin Burpy Bib, Princess Posie","These are the best burp cloths- they are bigger than all the others I bought, plus the shape helps them to stay in place on your shoulder. They are soft and absorbent, plus they have a snap to make them into a large bib. Superb!",5
Chicco Polly Highchair Woodstock,"This chair is advertised as having extra ""trays"" but in reality this model only has ONE extra tray. I find all the Chico colors muddy and unattractive and this is no exception. It was much cheaper here than at the local stores and we needed 2 chairs for our 2 new grandkids and I need them to fold and be stored between uses. The Chico apparently folds as flat or flatter than other chairs of its kind, but I miss the circa-1970 Cosco high chairs we had for our kids! They were nice metal chairs with metal tray and folded VERY flat! I sure wish I had kept ours when we moved to AZ! I am not impressed with all this overpriced plastic crapola with the ""bells and whistles"". I don't think this chair will be sturdy enough to be able to serve as a youth chair for a rambunctious toddler, but I hope I am wrong since it was so expensive. I have very little faith that any of this expensive plastic stuff will be around to be handed down and I'm sure that's what the manufacturers have in mind! Shipping time was longer than expected but the chairs arrived in perfect condition. But if I saw the old Cosco chairs at a garage sale, I'd  buy one and get rid of this behemoth in a second. The wheels are the best feature.",3
"Evenflo Amp Performance No Back Booster Car Seat, Green","My daughter loves this booster seat.  The seat is soft, so long car rides are not painful.  she especially loves the cup holder on the side to keep her drinks close by without spilling.",5
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White","Easy enough for my 3 yr old to open but keeps my 1 yr old out of the bathroom.  Easy to install, heavy duty.  Recommend to anyone.",5
Green Sprouts Nail Brush,"I looked hard and long to find a nail brush for my four week old little granddaughter and finally had the brilliant thought to look on Amazon where I found the perfect item,the Green Sprouts nail brush, and at what a bargain price:  less than the harsh and ugly nail brushes at the drug store.This little brush is the perfect size for baby's little fingers and very, very soft.  It is made from natural fibers and wood and I use it every time when I give the baby a bath especially now that she is starting to grab things and her little nails get dirty.What a wonderful product that I whole heartedly recommend to moms of newborns.",5
Graco Secure Coverage Digital Baby Monitor with 2 Parent Units,"While this worked, it worked well. But, both handsets died within a year of buying it. One after about 6 months and the other a couple months later. Now I am having to buy another monitor for our second child, less than two years later.",2
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I bought this when my son was two months old, based on ""Top Ten Best Toys for Infants"" lists, and I can really see why this is consistently at the top of those lists!This toy is large, about a foot long, and is made of a multitude of different brightly colored and textured fabrics for sensory play. The back of the butterfly is in graphic blacks and whites, which really worked for my 2 month old (at the time) since he was mesmerized by the black and white patterns until he got old enough and his vision improved enough to appreciate bright colors too. It comes with a large hook on top so you can hang it into any baby play-yard with an overhead arch, and the hook is sturdy, so your baby can't easily yank it down. The wings are made of crinkly fabric, and it comes with an internal rattle, a squeaker on one wing, a mirror on another wing, and two plastic rings on the bottom so your baby can yank on the butterfly and gnaw on the rings to his heart's content.Somewhat negatives: The hook is pretty thick and sturdy (which is a good thing) but it makes the toy not all that ""Take Along"" as the hook makes it nearly impossible to hang it on the carseat handle...we HAVE done so, but it requires a lot of muscle. Also the toy is a bit heavy and large so you DO have to hang it on something so the baby can play with it, so pairing it with a play-yard of some kind with an overhead arch is almost required.Overall, a great investment! Now my son is six months old, and he still gets hours of playtime out of this butterfly.",5

Capri Stroller - Red Tech,"When I gave birth to my 3rd child, my other children were 12 months old, and 5 years old... I do own a double stroller now that the baby is 7 months, the toddler is about 18 months, and my daughter is 5.5... but I also knew a single stroller would be needed.1.  The Chicco is reasonably priced for an umbrella stroller with ""benifits"", some like it are over $150 which I find ridicuous2.  The Chicco is very sturdy, and reliable... yet pretty lightweight. Its easy for me to lift, steer, push, and fold (although this requires the use of both hands). I wasnt in the market for a $5 piece of junk that would rattle and collapse as I strolled it around the block. The Chicco can handle almost everyplace we go, and is always in the car (takes up minimal space)3.  For a baby or toddler, the Chicco couldnt be better. The seat substantially reclines, and allows the baby to get in a good nap, this is also achievable if the baby is sleeping. The Chicco also has a five-point harness thats easy to adjust and use. Its pretty comfortable, and my son has never been bothered by it before. Theres also a fairly large canopy, although it only protects from directly overhead, its not curved (but what can you expect for an umbrella stroller?)4.  For me and my husband, the stroller has TALL handles (hes 6""2) and they are very comfortable (something VERY important to us!). I also love that the stroller is designed with parents in mind, niether of us bang our feet into the wheels as we walk, which was a problimatic occurance in my sisters Triumph stroller. We are also able to store a VERY small diaper bag inside the basket, which is a big sigh of relief!All in all if you are on the market for a simple, reliable stroller to take you from point A to point B, purchase the Chicco and I doubt you will be dissapointed.",5
Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate,"We bought this item because we rent a home. It seemed like it would be perfect because it did not have to be mounted into the wall brackets. That is the only positive thing about this gate. It is nearly impossible to stretch out and keep it locked so that it tightly fits the wall. We also we attracted to the expansion because our opening is 60 inches. We cannot get it to stay locked and therefore it falls down. Once in a while, it will work and stay locked but it was not very sturdy.  If you don't mind leaving it up and walking over it, then it will be just fine. We found that once we took it down, we couldn't get it back up. With two of us pulling on it for 15 minutes, we finally gave up. It's really not worth the money for a larger opening. We were going to use it to block off the hallway, but it doesn't get small enough to fit in that opening. I guess you get what you pay for.",1
Lambs and Ivy Enchanted Forest Rug,"Our little boy's nursery isn't too big so this little rug with it's bright colors was a perfect fit. It also matched the color scheme we designed the room in and the quirkiness of it is well appreciated. Oh and for those who are wondering the size since it's not listed, it's 40x30.",5
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,I like the concept of this produtc.  It has many uses.  My daughter is still kind of unsure about it but I know when she gets used to it she will love it.  Very good for eating on the go.,3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","My son had the boys version over 2 years ago, but only wanted to be held so we gave it away. Now my newborn daughter (she 3 1/2 months old) loves hers. The mobile and the lights don't entertain her for very long, but she takes all her naps which last between 1-3 hours on this swing. One of the main reasons I bought this particular swing is because you don't need batteries. We often forget to turn it off after taking her out and it never runs out of juice. For those customers who complain about the noise, I think they may have to open the legs wider. If you leave them too tight, it makes an annoying noise. Also if the baby and/or blanket is too heavy, it may make the same noise. I had too adjust the speed (level 3 for my 13 pounder and her blanket). I did not feel the need to start using the straps to hold her in until this week since she's become more mobile and could possibly fall out.  I sometimes also lay some sheets over the curtains on the swing to make it darker for her naps. Highly recommend this swing.",4
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Green/Blue","We got this seat instead of a highchair and it's worked out great, so far.  It straps firmly to any chair and is portable, so you can bring it to a friend's house to feed your baby.  It's also very easy to clean.",5
DEX Products Baby Wipes Warmer,"In the hospital, there wasn't a wipes warmer and our baby had super fits with every change.  Once we finally got home, the screaming diaper changes stopped with the use of the wipes warmer - it just makes this new task less truamatic for them.  I do find keeping it as full as possible is the trick, so that the wipes are closer to the top/heating element.  Also, cheap wipes do not work because they're not folded together and you can't get them to go through the top slot.  The Huggies wipes work the best as they come out the top nicely.  LOVE this item.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I purchased this tub because the toddler ring will not suction to the bottom of our tub.  This tub seemed to have great features, particularly the easy storage feature.  However, the underside of the inner ring has sharp edges, leaving my 6 month old with red marks across her chest and arms.  I have already returned it and was very disappointed.",2
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",My daughter pregnant with twins and asked me to get it. Came quickly and she says it has made a huge difference for her. Very happy with product,5
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","I did TONS of research and ended up deciding between this seat and the Graco Nautilus.  My 2 1/2 year old son is very big for his age (almost 40 lbs and 39"") and was outgrowing his Britax Roundabout.  I had him sit in both the Graco and the Frontier (I recommend trying the seats with your child in them).  As many reviews had stated, I too found that the crotch strap on the Graco was almost under him, even in the farthest setting. The Graco also fits a little narrower where his shoulders were.  So even though the price of the Graco was much lower than the Frontier, I felt that he would outgrow it very soon.  Since he's so young he'll need the 5 point harness for a few years still at least so I decided on the Frontier.My complaints (very minor) with the frontier are 1)that the strap that you pull to tighten the harness has a lot of resistence and so I really have to pull hard on it and pull up on the shoulder straps simultaneously to get the straps tight .  2) The lever to loosen the harness is not as easy to access as on the Roundabout- it is covered with fabric and I have to feel around for it.  And 3)I still can't find the ""pouch"" where the instruction book is supposed to go.  Also when I reach to get the harness strap I always seem to grab the flap of the cover on the seat because it is not completely attached.  These are really minor complaints.I also tried installing both seats into my car- a Volvo V70 (I recommend trying the seats in your vehicle too since many complaints on these seats involved installation issues). I did not have any problem tightening the seat down using LATCH or the seat belt method. I wish the Frontier 85 still had the LATCH adjustments on both sides rather than just one side, but I was able to get the seat just as tight.",4
"Orbit Baby G3 Infant Car Seat Plus Base, Black","This is the Cadillac of car seats! Please do not think this is the car seat to take in and out of the car. It weighs about 40-45 pounds by itself. However, it is VERY nice. The swivel base is amazing to take the child out of the car. You can use it from birth to about 40 pounds! We love it. So glad we are rolling with the big dogs! :)",5
"Merino Kids Baby Sleep Sack For Babies 0-2 Years, Banbury","I just received my sleep sack that I was planning to use for my 3-month-old daughter.  The side seams are badly twisted on both sides, and the sack does not lie flat.  It looks like it was either sewn improperly or washed or dried at high heat.  Other reviewers stated that items made in certain countries were of lesser quality.  The one I received was made in India.  These have gotten such great reviews, and I really don't want to use a polyester sleep sack, so I plan to order another one in the hopes that the next one won't be defective.UPDATE: I just received a second sleep sack after sending the first one back.  I now know that the first sack sent to me had been washed and/or dried improperly and then returned.  It was about half the size of the new replacement, and came with no instructions or tags.  The wool on the inside was also pilly.  The reason the seams were all twisted and wavy was because the garment had shrunk but the seams hadn't.  There was no way it would still fit my baby at two years old.The new one was quite large and laid flat, and came with a pretty mesh bag as well as instructions for use.  Unfortunately my baby hasn't been weaned from swaddling so I haven't gotten any use out of it yet.  I tried putting her down for her nap in the sleep sack and she wouldn't stop crying.  I gave up and swaddled her instead.  I will update this once we're able to wean her from swaddling (hopefully soon).  I will also be very careful about how I wash and dry it, since I know what will happen if I do it wrong.",1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Polypropylene Bottle, Opaque, 4 Ounce, 2 Pack","I have bought Avent bottles in 2010. They were light yellow. I loved the product! My children adapted well with nipples.Now, I bought another bottles. I received a new product, white. There is a piece that problably prevents liquids from leaking. It is ok, although I do not feel comfortable to send the bottle to the kindergarten (too many pieces to handle with).But, what I think it a step back on this product, is that the nipple is so soft that the child mouth blocks the passage of the milk. Every now and then I have to take the nipple out of his mouth, wait for the air to flow and than give the bottle to him again. It is not comfortable, since my children already take milk by themselves, but they are not old enough to know what to do when the milk is not flowing.",3
Booginhead SippiGrip - Blue,"This has saved my kids cup, toys, blankets, anything that can get dropped really form hitting the ground so many times. We love all the booginhead products we have tried. the Paci Clips are great but they will rust if exposed to water often. Say when your baby is in the kitty pool.",4
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"1st time mom and this was my saving grace. We used it for 3 months and was worth every penny. My daughter was really fussy and not much of anything calmed her but this bouncer consistantly did the trick. My Daughter LOVED this bouncer. She liked all the toys, sounds and lights. She will now stare at our fish tank for sometimes an hour. The Vibration option ran on 1 C"" battery,for a month. If I used the lights and music which took 3 C"" batteries they didn't last near as long but, she still was calmed by the vibrations and looking at the fish. I had NO problems with this product...read the directions and cautions and you shouldn't have any problems either. I stopped using it when she became stronger and moved more... seemed common sense to me. It's not a heavy duty toy but a very entertaining and calming product. It's not easy or convenient to store after it's put togeather. It doesn't fold up which is the only reason I am getting rid of it now.",5

Baby Einstein Discovering Music Activity Table,My 1yr. old grandson loves this and it educational!,5
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot",Bought this to keep the pacifier in the general vicinity of the baby. Normally he spits it out and cries like a little...baby.Before the pacifier would forever be lost in the catacombs underneath him but now I can easily find the pacifier again.I do wish the clamp was easier to use with one hand but I can see it's really secure and that's what really matters.,4
"Evenflo Convertible High Chair, Dottie Rose",I think the design of the high chair is smart and like that it can double as a chair and table.  It is also sturdy/won't tip over due to the wide base.  It's also very light and easy to move.  Cons are that it doesn't fold up so it may not work if you done have a lot of room.  Also the seat cover is a little slippery and sometimes my baby slumps a little down in the seat and I have to readjust her for optimal eating posture. But I think that will resolve as she grows bigger.  Overall OK for the money.,4
Traffic Light Lamp,Junk..dont buy your wasting your money. Cheaply made and didnt work when I got it...I thought it was bigger and the quality was better.  Requesting a refund. You can have it back.,1
"Thirsties Hemp Inserts 2 Pack, Small 6-18 Lbs","We have bought quite a few packs of these. They are a MUST for overnight cloth diapering. Our son sleeps about 12 hours straight and these keep him from waking up with a wet diaper and also keep him from getting a rash. They really SOAK up a lot! Which also means they need extra drying time when they come out of the wash, so we end up hang drying them while we put the rest of the diapers in the dryer.",5
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","This is perfect for the tub, it's simple, cute, and more importantly serves the purpose of keeping the faucet hidden.",5
"Zoli Gummy Sticks Baby Gum Massagers, Green/Orange","My son is just 9 weeks old and he has been showing signs of early teething for a few weeks now. I tried the teething rings we were given at our baby shower but they were just to big for his little mouth.  The only thing that was working to sooth him was sticking my pinky finger in his mouth so he could chew on it.  I wanted something I could stick in his mouth, and that he could learn to grip as well.  As soon as I put it in his mouth he was happy!  It was an instant pleaser and easily took the place of my finger.  He has even held it on his once once!  I'm glad to have found something that fits in his mouth and makes teething a bit better.",4
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Percale Fitted Cradle Sheet, Ecru","I was very unhappy with this sheet.  I bought it for my grand babys cradle.  Delivery was prompt.  However I found the sheet to be rough feeling and the fit for the cradle was not good.  I have ordered other items form the same company and have been very satisfied.  However, I would not recommend the cotton percale sheet.",2

Nuby 5 Count Splish Splash Stacking Bath Cups,"My son loves filling the cups and dumping the water out during his baths. They are colorful, have different shapes and sizes, easy to clean and easy to store. I wish they were not made in China but, like most toys, I could not find cups for this price that were made elsewhere. Simple design but hours of fun.",5
Magic Bumpers Portable Child Bed Safety Guard Rail 48 Inch,"We bought our 1yr old daughter one of those plastic toddler beds that 'come with rails'... The problem is, the rails are all the way up by her head and don't go down far enough (for any child I would think). Well she's a pretty crazy sleeper, so eventually throughout the night she would scoot to the bottom and come close to falling out. Eventually she did fall out twice, but was okay because she fell right into the dogs bed lolAnd then began my hunt for bed rails for the bed 'with rails'! Everything I found was made for regular toddler beds or cribs, I didn't want to take the chance of having to send something back. Luckily I cam across these Magic Bumpers!! They fit her bed just right!! Tonight will be the first night to test them, but I am confident they will work :D The only slight problem which I did read about, is the fitted sheet won't go all the way down anymore :/ Thus my hunt for deep pocketed crib sheets! Any suggestions? :]",4
DoorSmoocher Childproof Sliding Pocket Door and Swing Door Lock,"I used these on a set of dual pocket doors that the builder neglected to install a lock on.  The only reason we need a lock is a super smart cat.  While this stops her from opening the door, there is a gap that causes the doors to move together from left to right (about an inch).  Cat seems more interested in playing with the door now...",2
Peg Perego P3 Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Mod Verde,"Green canopy, brilliant on the park, no one just passing, they stare it, said ""it is beautiful"" somtimes.Real smooth riding and turnning, really tough even on the gravel road and soccer complex. All the moving part, designed for comportable. My 11 month daughter love this more than car seat. Do not buy retail price. I buy one zt $176. Do not pay full price for current year model. Buy one from last year at half price then enjoy primium product and pride.",5
"green sprouts Baby Food Mill, Green",I like this for making baby food for my 8 month old.  It makes a good consitancy for a baby that has already started with some solids.  It won't get it fine enough for a new eater.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it leaks out the bottom so you have to use it over the sink.  I bought it hoping to take it to restaurants but I can't imagine doing that if it leaks.,3

"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","My baby has reflux.  It has been an uphill battle finding formula and medication to help control her problem.  These bottles are a great addition to the arsenal combating the problem.  They don't add to the overload on her poor tummy by by allowing excess air in.  I've experimented with Playtex nursers, Avent nursers, and regular bottles trying to find something that would help and not add to the problem.  After an unfortunate incident wherein I managed to pop the bag in the Playtex nurser while attempting to release excess air, the baby managing to collapse the nipple on the Avent, and a terrible vomiting episode after using the regular bottles, Dr. Brown's have been a God Send.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","We fell in love with this lunch bag.  it's adorable and matches his book bag.  I was hesitant in ordering this because child tried zipping and unzipping two other skip hop lunch bags at target.  The ziper keeps getting stuck behind the animal's features ( hair, arms,) that are flapping adjacent to zipperline.  It was so cute we ordered the bee one anyway.  However it is not stain resistant or big enough for a preschooler's lunch and snacks.  The pocket that holds the ice pack has no closure so the ice pack always falls out when you move the bag.  For one dollar more, I will purchase a stain resistant and larger lunchbox with horizontal and vertical strap/ handle with easy zippering.Be prepared to scrub hand wash this lunchbag daily since yellow is such a light color.",3
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,I don't love them I don't hate them.  I don't use them as much as I thought I would just because it takes a minute to attach everything and usually it's just easier to have one of my other kids push the other stroller.,3
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Non Spill Soft Spouts, 6 Months","please don't waste your money on these spouts that are not a Klean Kanteen product, they are just Avent spouts that you can buy for less than $5 at Target and not have to pay another $4 for shipping.",4

"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Assembly was really easy, it took me less than 10 minutes to mount it. Just follow the instructions. Door is easy to open for my 2 year old, unless I apply the safe &#34;red button&#34;, so I can use it to stop the cat from entering a room (allowing my 2 years old to go in and out) or to stop the toddler and the cat with the safety thing on.If you put enough pressure against it, it will detach. So far not  a problem with my kid, but please, follow instructions and don't use it on top of stairs without screws.",4
Lambs &amp; Ivy Baby Aviator Sheet,I love this pattern and I had to have this sheet since it matched the window valences.  It's just WAY too overpriced for a fitted sheet.,4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","We got this to use on a nice looking storage box that would hold toys, and look like it was ment to be in the family room. The box is a bit taller than the typical toy box and has sharp corners.  I thought we needed both edge guards and corner guards.  But after putting on the corners, I found the foam padding was stronger and softer than I expected and now we have the Edge Guards to use elsewhere.  Because of the length of the edge guards, even more uses may come from this.  More money to spend on the baby and we all now how much they want/need.",5
DaVinci Emily Mini Crib - White,"This little crib is really well made, cute and just the right size for small babies.  The mattress that comes with it is worthless, however.  I bought the mattress that is recommended to be used with it.",5

Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This swing turned out to be the most valuable shower gift we received. Our one month old didn't like sleeping in the cradle we had set up for him next to our bed. He has been sleeping in this swing since his second night home from the hospital. It's the perfect size so he feels nestled in and cozy. I feel at ease knowing he's on his back but propped up just a little in case he spits up. Plus he doesn't like being flat on his back yet anyway. The music and other sounds along with the rocking make it easy to soothe him to sleep. I just lean over from my bed and turn it on. It shuts off automatically so I don't need to worry about that. He's also now enjoying the mirror and mobile overhead, so he's perfectly happy in the swing when he's awake too. This swing has been a lifesaver for us!",5
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,"I loved these, I've had other kinds in the past but this one was by far the best quality, very easy to install. I used it on a corner cabinet but it also worked on a double door cabinet. We are moving so I had to take them off, I had a little bit of trouble getting them off, which is actually a good thing, if you don't want them removed. All and All, I definitely recommend these over the other products out there.",5
Safety 1st Bottle Medicine Dispenser,"I bought this to give my son his daily vitamans. Dr. said it would be best to mix with milk as the vitamains tend to stain. He is only breast feed so I just needed a small bottle for him. This works well, but my son dose not seem to like the shape of the nipple. When he does take a bottle he uses the Tommie Tippy brand which has a much diffrent nipple. Likely would work great for other kids who are better with a bottle",4
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","The concept - awesome.  But our 2nd one in a year is already broken. So, I either have a diaper stuffing husband on my hands that forces the diapers in and breaks it, or the design is faulty. The spring is broken/disconnected so it's hard to get the diapers in the &#34;chute&#34;.  We can't figure out how to fix it. Another easy route would be using biodegradable dog doo bags to contain the smell and using a regular garbage.  Seems pretty easy to me. The bag refills get pricey.",3
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","Got these to prevent some sun from blinding my little girl now that she's front facing in her car seat. Got them and all seemed great until I went to use them. And the sun was still blinding her, just through these. Maybe blocked 10% but not at all successful for reducing the direct sun rays. Try a different brand, this isn't worth it even though it seems like your getting a good deal price wise",2

"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","It's really cute to look at, but we were hoping that is choop would be useful.The raspberry part of the teether is way too big for our three-month-old's mouth.  She gags and chokes with the red part of the teeether in her mouth.She's teething already and we've been looking around for something for her to gnaw on besides me (ouch).This teether is not useful to us.  Save your money and try something else, unless you just want a ""cute"" baby item to decorate your house.",1
Nickelodeon Backyardigans Toddler Bed,"My son loves the Backyardigans, so I was thrilled to find a Backyardigans toddler bed for him to move into after his crib.  The bed did come in a different color theme than shown though, which I am actually happier with.  It came in a lighter blue/yellow color and showed the Backyardigans on their pirate ship.  Very cute!",5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"Overall, we have found this to be a great monitor.  We really like the voice activated feature.  However, I just wanted to make everyone aware that once the battery dies (for us it took about 1 1/2 years) you cannot find a replacement battery anywhere except to order it directly from Sony and with tax and shipping it costs $18 for one battery!",4

"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White","As the subject of my review reads, it was a breeze to install, and it has been a good deterrent for my curious toddler.

Bento Decoration - Food Picks (Animal) 15pcs,"I purchased these to add a little bit of cute to my lunch without having to do any actual work.

The colors are bright and fun and they were exactly as pictured!",5

"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large","I gave the Wheely Mouse to my granddaughter for her first birthday.  It is well made and as cute as can be.  She was fascinated by the ears.

"Leachco BumpZZZ Travel Bed, Brown/Green Forest Frolics","we bought several travel beds for our 16 month old who could climb out of his pack n play.  all the others were air mattresses and seemed uncomfortable.  he woke up all night crying on them.  for the next trip we got the bumpzzz and it was great.  it seemed much more comfortable and my son was excited about his """"big boy bed.""""  the raised edges helped him stay inside the bed all night and not roll out.  he loved the owl fabric.  there is room for some of his crib toys to sleep in it with him.  it folds up easily but it is kind of large for travel.  it dies take up a good amount of space in our car.",5
Sassy Sensation Station Suction Toy,"Great baby toy.  However, the music doesn't last long.  This is the second one I've bought and within weeks the batteries have run out leaving my grandson frustrated because it is his favorite toy and he loves the music.",4
"Britax Marathon G4 Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","Okay so for the longest time, I told myself that I would never get a Britax, no reason other than the price. After reading countless reviews, I finally decided to do it, and seriously, I'll NEVER go back to any other car seat brand. Ever. Ever since my daughter moved to a front facing seat, she NEVER slept in the car. Even on long road trips. She would maybe sleep for like 20 minutes and call it good. This is why I decided to give Britax a try. Ever since having the Britax, SHE SLEEPS!! The seat reclines beautifully, making sleeping easier on those little bobbling necks. I LOVE IT! Also the little things, like the clips that attach the car seat to your car metal clips, they have a button, so you're not getting your fingers down in there, and pinching them and whatever else. (I know that doesn't really make sense, but if you buy this seat, you'll understand. It's amazing.) Just do it. Spend the cash. You won't regret it.",5
Chicco Little Driver Baby Walker,"My 4 month old daughter LOVES this walker. It adjusts down a lot lower than most walkers we've seen so her toes can touch the ground. The buttons on it make cute noises; cat and dog sounds, bells, whistles and songs. The tray is also easily removed so she can play with other toys if need be. Great purchase!",5
"MAM BPA Free 5 oz Bottle for Boy, 3-Pack ((Patterns and motifs may vary)","After trying literally every bottle on the market to get my exclusively breastfed baby to take a bottle so she could start daycare, I found these. Although she didn't just take to them real well right away as she just didn't want bottles at all, these were the ones she actually 'tried' to take. She still refuses some days but these bottles are still the ones she prefers and she always refuses all others. The nipples are the most soft of all the silicone ones I have tried and they are flattened in shape more like the breast. The nipples have a textured velvety feel to them too. The bottles are easy to use and easy to clean, cap, nipple, ring, body, base, and rubber piece. Just be sure you seat the bottom rubber seal evenly. I haven't had any problem with leaking. The bottles are just plain cute as well. So glad I bought these! Would recommend to anyone.",5
"Munchkin Safety Sunblock Shade, Hello Kitty",it was pretty i like its loos but i thought i was getting 2. i gave it a 3 because i find it a bit small and doesn't completely shade  my baby . the baby loves it though.,3
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"My son is on the small side for a twenty month old boy.  I purchased this product after I realized that he would not use the big potty at his sister's swim practice, and he was refusing to wear anything but his big boy pants... They sell this product at a major toy store for very little money so I bought it there.  For putting it on a big potty it works WONDERFUL.  No issues there at all.  The size is great for carrying with you, and the bag that comes with it is a nice touch.  My only issue is that when I set it up as a stand alone potty and my son promplty sat down on it, it collapsed.  I tried it again, same thing (much more reluctant child though).  I was not able to get it to click into place, which is apparently the problem... I do think its worth the money though, especially if you get one that will click into place.  Sure its small, but this is for babies as young as 15 months.. bigger toddlers/pre schoolers will likely need something else.",3
"OXO Tot Tub Drain Stopper, Blue","It isn't rocket science, but the OXO Tub Drain Stopper works pefectly. One bathtub slowly drains during baths. This completely stops it. It stays put on the drain, comes up easily when pulled, and hangs on the side of the tub when not in use as advertised.I hope this doesn't sound like an advertisement, but considering how inexpensive this is, it turns out to be a great value for the money. It saved us a visit from a plumber or an afternoon replaceming the built in stopper.",5
Dr. Brown's Lace Contoured Breast Pads,"After reading reviews of other breast pads, I decided to try Dr. Brown's. They are large (good coverage) and absorbent (no leaks or damp feeling) without being too thick and noticeable. You can easily fold them out of the way in your bra cup when nursing. The liner is a comfy jersey-like material and the outer ""lace"" helps to keep the pad from sliding around in your bra. They come in a package of 4 with a small net bag so you can throw them in the washing machine. I haven't used other breast pads apart from the Medela disposables (which are individually wrapped -- too wasteful for my taste) but I'm not tempted after buying these.",5
Sealy Baby Posturepedic Crown Jewel Mattress,This mattress is firm but it definitely has a little give to it. Seems extremely comfortable! Makes my husband and I want a new mattress for ourselves,5
Sassy Baby's Mam 9 oz. Girl 3 pack Bottle,"I bought these specifically after the BPA scare and not wanting to pay so much for the born free bottles. Overall I think these are good. When I put them in the bottle warmer they do seem to take longer than the other bottles to heat up, perhaps because they are thicker and wider at the bottom. I don't have problems with dripping but always make sure the bottom is screwed on correctly otherwise I can see the potential for dripping. Cleaning is not too difficult.",4
Ocean Wonders Sea Life Double Toggle Light Switchplate Cover,I received this quickly and was so impressed with the service. the plate is beautiful and good quality so i'm getting the other matching outlet cover. thank you!,5
Philips Avent Baby Bath and Room Thermometer Sch550/20,"Superb thermometer!  very handy, made well!  it can stand on it's on in the room and show temp in C.  great design, sort of rubber design.  and can also be put in the water for the reading.  Bought 2 of these, one for the room, one for the bathroom for our newborn.  Outstanding Avent!",5
Baby Einstein Count and Compose Piano,"This is a fun little toy that my 6-month old son enjoys playing with. As another reviewer mentioned, one of the great things about this piano is how varied the melodies are. Not only does it play classical pieces but your child can compose his/her own music as well, which means mom and dad don't have to hear the same melody over and over and over... big plus!The one down-side is that the speaker is on the bottom of the toy, which means that if your child doesn't hold the piano on his/her lap while playing with it the sounds is very muffled. My son still likes to play with it - muffled sounds and all - but I can't help marveling that the designers put the speaker in such an unfavorable location. Einstein would blush to know that such an obvious design flaw was incorporated into a product with his name on it!",3
"Carters Wrap Me Up Receiving Blanket, 4 Pack, Green",Cons:Too small for swaddling.Too small and thin for wrapping up baby and feeling cozy.Pros:Cute patterns.Comes out of the dryer feeling soft.,2
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Take-Along Play Blanket,I brought this blanket for my daughter-in-law. The ability to carry this product all folded into the zebra was a great plus.. easy to take with you and have an immediate blanket to place baby on.Interactive toys will be great as she gets older all in one package. I think any young mum would find this handy to have and it makes for a great gift idea as well.,4

"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I wanted some way to wear my baby that would be comfortable for both of us.  A few friends recommended moby and moby style wraps, so I got this with high hopes.  My son and I both found it cumbersome, hot, and constricting.  Maybe we weren't doing something right, but he hated.*There are SO many layers of material, once you finally manage to get the damned thing on properly, that the both of you will be sweating like proverbial professional women in a church before long.*Actually getting the thing ON is way too much like work, and if you want to nurse in it, it takes even more finagling and adjustment. I never managed to successfully nursed in my moby wrap.  It could be that I am too well endowed to nurse in a wrap, but the way the wrap squashed my son against me made it impossible for him to nurse without having his entire face mashed into my breast.  Suffocation is not exactly a positive side effect of breastfeeding.*On the subject of squashing, I never managed to find a happy medium for this thing.  Either we both felt constricted, or it was too loose for me to feel confident wearing it.  My son wasn't, I guess, normal in the constriction department.  Rather than being soothed by swaddling and confining wraps, he would throw an absolute conniption.I think some of our issues may have been worked out with practice, but the thing is so time consuming to put on and arrange, and I was so sweaty and tired after wrestling with the wrap and the baby, plus the wrap at the waist pressed directly into my c-section which was unpleasant for quite some time after I was (per the doctor) healed enough for normal activity, that I just didn't have the patience to keep trying at it.  My baby threw a fit every time he was in it, and that stressed me out completely.  I just didn't have the stamina for this  method.He did like a sling carrier when he was very young.  He was a very long and large baby (22 in at birth), so the sling didn't last long before that started to make him feel constricted as well, and a sling isn't as secure as the moby, which was a drawback for actually accomplishing much in the way of errands and/or chores while wearing the baby... which kind of was the whole purpose.I finally hit on something that did (and does) work for us.  It's a mei tai, or Asian Baby Carrier.  I found a free tutorial online, and it was a screaming success.  I am NOT an accomplished seamstress by any stretch of the imagination, but this was pretty simple construction, and only took a couple hours to put together, one the pieces had been cut.  Hip carry isn't very comfortable for us, but front and back carry are incredibly comfortable.  My husband has 3 ruptured discs in his lower back, and even he can carry our son in the mei tai for short periods.  I can get it on and off in under 2 minutes.  There are no complicated wrappings, twistings, or turnings.  My son's legs are free, and he can get his arms in and out if he wants to, which makes him very happy.  He's content to hang out in the mei tai for longer than I'm content to wear him.  He weighs 30 lbs now, so he's quite a load, but the mei tai lets me carry him with very little effort.  I can even squat, bend (with care, I mean gravity does still work), wash dishes, make the beds, I've even put on my shoes with him in the mei tai with no problems.Of course, everyone is different, so what works for us may not work for someone else, and it seems quite a lot of people love the moby.  We didn't.",1
"Skip Hop Zoo Bib, Dog","I love this bib! It's cute and sturdy, has good coverage, and can be rinsed off easily. I especially love the fact that it has a little flap it can tuck into for traveling.",5
"Summer Infant SwaddlePod 2-Pack, Hungry Caterpillar, Newborn","Nice product, but my baby is still able to get his arms free, as soon as I put him down his arms will be sticking out of the neck hole!  Nice design as the zipper is protected and doesn't irritate his skin.",3
Munchkin Five Sea Squirts,"Soft and playful a very handy size for a toddler. My kid loves these, and carries them around beyond the bath (which can be tricky since they do hold water, so unless I sqeeze them before she carts them off, we end up with little wet spots on everything, but well-worth it!)As soon as she got these, she learned the words for all the animals - great joy for me, since as an ocean-lover, I was mildly vexed that she'd previously failed to take interest in marine life, preferring to stick to farm animals;)",5
NEW*Mud Pie Pretty in Pink Chiffon Rosette Bib Baby Girls Size 11x10,"This is absolutely the cutest bib I have ever seen.  I also bought the matching Mud Pie Rosette Hair band, gown, 2 pc. outfit, and shoes.  It is all so cute and can't wait to see it all on my new granddaughter.",5

Little Bedding by NoJo Dreamland Teddy Bear Mobile,"My daughter goes nuts for the bears and just loves watching them spin. We tried hanging up three hearts on the mobile and left just one bear and she will only look at the one bear! She smiles and laughs every time the music starts! I decided to buy another one for the play pen because she liked it so much, hopefully your daughter will too!",5
"Coverplay Chenille Play Yard Slipcover, Sammy",Product had no instructions. Strange fit as the sides where fabric is without breathing area is to thick.Nice idea though.,2
Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,"I got this for my grandson's birthday. He loves it!!!! In fact, he won't eat off of anything except these dishes. We also got the silverware for him, and he loves it!!!!",5
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","Love this product.  It makes bath time much easier.  I'm only giving it one star because it requires a lot of maintenance.  It takes forever to dry.  The only way I can get it dry is to hang it outside in the sun.  Hanging inside takes 2-3 days to dry.  With an infant, it's hard to find time to hang outside and remember to bring back in.  It's sure to mold with the 2 day drying time.  Guess I will be trashing it soon.",1
PumpEase Classic Collection hands-free pumping bra - Verry Cherry - M,"I have Medela Pump 'n Style pump. Initially I was hoping I could use this pump with only one hand but even changing settings on the pump proved to be a challange with one hand, since both are needed to hold the cups over the breasts. This bra changed all of that. I am now able to easily adjust pump settings, eat breakfast, switch tv channels and answer emails on my smart phone. This is just the 15 minutes I would not have otherwise. Great product and absolutely worth the money.",5
Infantino Sash Mei Tai Carrier Black/Gray,"Easy to read instructions, great tushie support and fairly easy to put on. No buckles which is super nice! My little one loves to ride around and see what his mother is getting into. 3 different positions is nice and easy to throw into the washer. Too bad little one can't ride facing out, I really like it and my friend loves it!",5
Playtex Diaper Genie Essentials Diaper Disposal Pail,"We bought this before our son was born, and threw it away before he was three days old. I refused to give it to someone else, and subject them to such a terribly designed diaper pail. At first I was convinced that we were using it incorrectly. I couldn't conceive that someone intended me to stick my hand into a filthy bag to throw away a diaper. The trap door has a lot of resistance, so you really have to push against the diaper to get it in there. It's impossible to keep the area above the trap door clean, and the hole is pretty small, so even if you've managed to keep yourself relatively clean through the diaper change, when you go to throw the diaper away you'll have crap all the way from your hand to your elbow.",1
"Aden by aden + anais 3 Pack Muslin Washcloths, Girls And Swirls","I have been impressed with Aden and Anahi's products. They wash up well and are quality made products. These particular wash cloths are larger so they are tough to use with newborns, will be great for older babies. Would recommend.",5

Munchkin 6 Count Waterproof Changing Pad Liners,"These things are fantastic.  I have 6 for my 3 month old & I got 6 for my mother, who provides childcare for us.  The liners have so many uses & wash well & dry very quickly.  I will be getting these as baby shower gifts for anyone I know going forward.",5
KidCo Magnet Lock Starter Set,"There is another version of this product I bought at Target that is installed using screws & tools.  This product is just as good, and takes mere seconds to install using the sticky pads included in the package.  These locks have kept my 2yo twins out of my cabinets and protected them from the cleaning products under the sink.  GREAT product!",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System,"just about to order another 2 packs.  They use these at my kids daycare and decided if they were good enough for them they should work good for us too.  You cannot upen the door when locked.  Really great idea.  Directions were confusing, so I mounted the door lock first then the cabinet part by eyeing it.  great product- highly recommeneded.",5

Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Home - Replacement Pieces,"I got the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Home from a friend, it was in good shape just missing a few of the smaller pieces.  The replacement parts fit great and my granddaughter loves to play with the house.",5
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner for Highchairs, Blue","This placemat is easy to carry & use when out & about & has strong suction cups (as long as there's no table cloth underneath). Food can even be placed right on it & the mini well that hangs down in front of your child catches most spills & food. The only drawback is that because the material is flexible & does not lay completely flat because of the design, sometimes bottles/cups may tip over unless placed in the center of the mat,",4
Balboa Baby Adjustable Sling by Dr. Sears - Geisha Trim,"I really wanted to like this sling (after all we spent $60 on it!) but my daughter isn't too fond of it and she squirms around so much that I'm afraid she will fall out (even when using the sling I hold her the same way I would if she wasnt in it so really what's the point?). When she was a very newborn we were able to use it and she didn't mind but at about 4 weeks it was over. I am keeping my fingers crossed that maybe she will come around (she's 4 months) but I think we are going to have to buy a traditional carrier where she can easily see and move her limbs around a bit more freely. Also I think I would feel better having her in something a bit more secure so I can do housework (like vacuuming and laundry) and hold her at the same time. The sling is pretty (we have the black and white one) and I am glad so many people like the sling, it was great when my baby was a newborn.. maybe if we would have put her in it more often she would like it now... I'm also short someone mentioned that it doesn't work as well with short people.(I'm 5'2).Overall, I would get this as a secondary carrier (if you find your baby loves to be bundled and cuddled) because even if your baby doesn't like the traditional one at least you don't have to worry about them squirming their way out of it and potentially harming themselves. Best wishes with your little ones!",3
100% Cotton Terry Contour Changing Pad Cover - Lavender,I am not really impressed with the fabric. It's not soft terry cloth it's cheap terry cloth but for $12.99 I guess I hoped for more. It'll get the job done but I love the chenille fabric better it's soft on my baby's little butt and I'd rather lay her on it than the terry cloth. I do like the variety of colors that the terry cover has to offer.,2
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Scatterbug","I love the way that the seat attaches to a chair and the recline is great. It works fine with the tray but I cannot push it up to my table. The arms get in the way and I can't get the seat close enough to the table and she makes a mess. The newer models do not appear to have the pesky arms on them, which I think will solve the problem.",3
"Carter's Keepsake Chest, Meadowlark",this is a very cute box and has plenty of room for all of the little things we brought home from the hospital...,5
"The Shrunks Stepaire Bandit Nap Pad, Orange","I think the concept of this nap pad is great (built in pump, attached blanket, etc.), however, I was not super impressed with the Nap Pad itself. I followed the instructions exactly. I made sure the valve was completely closed. I stepped on the pump the designated 40-50 times, it never inflated. I finally decided to just blow the mat up manually using the small valve on the side. Once I inflated it 75% of the way, I was able to use the foot pump to fill up the rest of the mat. I'm not sure what the deal is, but it definitely didn't inflate using the foot pump alone.The nap mat itself seems to be pretty comfortable. I think it's best suited for a child age 2-3. Otherwise, you'll probably have feet sticking out from the end of the blanket. It was a good size for my three-year-old, but it was almost too short for my four-year-old. The mat and blanket are soft, and I liked that it is easy to roll it up for storage. The built-in pillow is an added plus as well.The main selling feature of the mat is the built-in pump and that was a bit of a disappointment (I tried it, my husband tried it, my son tried it, and none of us had luck inflating the mat using the pump alone.).",3
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"I have been using this for about a month and so far it has been great.  It's pretty basic as far as cameras go, but it has proved to be reliable and the picture and sound quality is better than I could have asked for.  My only complaint is that once the handheld unit gets low on battery, it makes this awful incessant beeping and won't stop unless you turn it off or plug it in.  During the day for naps it's not usually an issue, but at night plugging it in is a definite must.",5
"Thirsties Duo Wrap, Honeydew, Size Two (18-40 lbs)",I've been using these since day 1 on my 7 lb newborn girl in combination with green mountain diaper nb prefolds and a snappi. We haven't had a single leak and it fits perfectly over the diaper. I prefer velcro to snaps.,5

This fits it exactly and came very quickly.,5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","My little man was kicking away at pretty much everything he could and we purchased this for him this week, hoping that he'd enjoy it. And.. he loves it!! The lights and music capture his attention and since he recently began grabbing at things, the dangling toys are exciting for him as well. We also have an activity mat and this piano has quickly replaced that as far as his interest goes, the toys are easier to grab and it gives his kicking legs something to do. He gets a little frustrated when he can't get the toys into his mouth, but that's not a criticism of this gym.. just make sure you have something else close by that your little one can teethe on if you're at that point!! Love this, highly recommend it!!",5
Safety 1st 2 Count Side By Side Cabinet Lock,So fast to open and you get use to it. My toddler can't open but she knows when it's open they need to closed. Very sturdy and nice &#34;snap&#34; close!,5
QuickZip Crib Zipper Sheet - Ecru,"I can't recommend this product enough.  I have twins and these quick-zip sheets are THE BEST.  Along with my mattress pad, I put an additional mattress pad piece under the middle section of the crib and when they have a pee, poop, puke, etc. it is a cinch to unzip the sheet and pull both the sheet top and mattress piece out to wash.  I rarely have to take the mattress out of the crib  and wash the big mattress pad and big sheet(which is a real pain).  This is an amazing product and one of the smartest purchases I have ever made.",5
Sticky Bellies -Sticky Bellies Monthly Milestone Stickers - Oh Sew Ready : Maternity : 12-40 Weeks,"I have a 16 month old and missed out on this super cute photo opportunity, so being we are expecting our 3rd and last I HAD to have these!!! They are super cute and delivery was amazingly fast!!! Thank you so much for helping us create memories!!",5
Jeep Deluxe Changing Pad,"This changing pad is fits well in my Carter's diaper bag and in my handbag when I don't feel like using the diaper bag.It allows me to reach all diaper changing essentials quickly.  At church I don't have to cart off the entire diaper bag to the washroom.  This is like my new purse, so long as  the baby is with me, the jeep deluxe changing pad goes to.  I even stick my keys in the outside pocket.I gave it a four because the inside compartment pockets only allow for a small tube of diaper cream. My small jar cannot fit.",4
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),Its great using instead of your fingers. Use it for my facials whille their mask is drying I apply gently to scalp.,5
"Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Standard Neck Bottle, 4 oz - 3-Pack","I bought many of these bottle for my baby, they were good until recently I noticed the paint on the bottle comes off.  This becomes a big concern for us, I have to tripple check the bottle after each wash to ensure the paint doesn't stay in side of the bottles!",2
KidCo Convertible Crib Bed Rail Finish: Natural,"We are more than pleased with this product. A few of the reviews we read, some people were disappointed that the woodwas unfinished. We, however, thought this worked to our advantage as we were able to stain the wood to matchour sons furniture EXACTLY! Not only are we pleased with the color,it's solid wood and very durable, unlike the plastic ones that tend to bend. It is so easy to assemble, and to remove it so you can make the bed is even easier! Overall, this isa wonderful product.",5
"Marvel Spiderman Toddler Bedding Set, Red",My son loved this bedding set.  Th sheets are very soft and are is good quality.  The price was good and I received the package in good time without having to pay extra.,5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,Loved this pillow during pregnancy.  The small crook goes nicely under your head while the length of the pillow supports your tummy.  The sleepless nights I had before this pillow almost stopped immediately once it arrived. I just used two pillow cases to cover the pillow rather than spending extra money for a fitted one.,5
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!","I love these blankets. I received them from a friend when my son was born and LOVED them. I used them as a nursing cover (worked much better than my nursing cover), a blanket, and a spit up towel. I give these blankets to all of my pregnant girlfriends even if they aren't on their baby list. Definite must have for a newborn baby.",5
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","Super soft, great colors, perfect for my new baby.They do look a little worn after you wash them though.",4
"Combi All in One Activity Walker, Pink",Love this walker. It's really cute and kept my little guy busy with all the toys and music to play with.,5
Earlyears Roll n Swirl Ball Ramp,"The only thing that was cute was that the baby figured out how to put the balls on top and then watch them come down. Other than that, she spent more time pulling them apart because the second one never fit right with the rest. Didn't matter what order they were in the first two never stayed with the bottom three. My 18 month old now uses the balls as shakers instead of using this toy lol.",2
"American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Minky Dot Tailored Crib Skirt, Celery","I normally am not one to be nit-picky, but I ordered the Celery color bed skirt, and it is MUCH lighter than is pictured. It's very pale, and from standing a few feet away, it is not clear that it's supposed to be a green color. The other color options didn't fit with my theme, so I think I will have to keep it. Other than the color, it appears to be of good quality and is nice and long to cover some things I have stashed under the crib. I only took off 2 stars because of the significant color difference than the picture.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","If I had one complaint, it is that it turns off after 45 minutes. It helps light up the room at night and sometimes when my daughter wakes up she is scared of the dark.",5
"Graco Highback TurboBooster Car Seat, Spitfire","We bought this seat because our three year old was just getting way too big for her convertible car seat. She is in the 95th percentile for both her height and weight, she's only a couple inches shorter than her four year old cousin and she just turned three about three weeks ago. She is way more comfortable and has so much more room to get comfortable. We're taking it on our first long trip this weekend so we'll see how she does. She always hated long trips in her other seat because she was so confined and could barely move. We've had this for a few weeks and so far so good :)",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog",Excelent product. My sister in law uses her with my nephew for about 3 years and it's  in great condittions. Just cleaning and using everytime.,5
"Sassy Baby Changing Pads 36 Count Box, White",Box advertises Absorbent/Soft.  EPIC FAIL!You may as well go to HD and buy the thin plastic they sell. This product is THAT terrible.Paper part is non-existent.Thing rips.They are too small to cover any useful area.For a baby product - it's unusable!Dog?

"Bumkins Flushable Diaper Liner, Neutral, 100 Pack",Grandson has several skin allergies and these really work as described and was happy for that and so was he,5
Medela Nursing Stool,"Do yourself a favor and purchase this item, it will be more helpful to you than any specific nursing pillow.As a first time mother who really struggled with breastfeed I spent a great deal of time in my glider rocking chair working on getting my LO to latch. I was using a kids stepping stool because without it I feet wouldnt touch the ground completely (I'm 5'6). The problem with that stool was it was a flat top and I found myself placing my feet at the edge to  at an angle which was not comfortable if barefoot. In hindsight it was  Also  to high.I made an appt with a lactation nurse because of cracked nipples and problems with latching and she had this or a similar stool. One of my first question was where can I get this? But she didn't know because she had bought it from a closing store in town. My feet rested so comfortably on the stool, at the perfect angle, which supported my posture and helped with my back.After continued struggles at home it dawned on me to Surch the Internet and ofcourse came to find it on Amozon!By the time I purchased it my LO was 2.5months. Feeling more comfortable with nursing I feed her in bed a lot using the laid back aproach (biological nursing?) but when I nurse in a chair/ couch I drag this little baby around because I just can't do without it.Registered or not I now plan on purchasing this for my friends who will be expecting their first baby. It's an item that most people don't know they need!",5

"Philips AVENT Hard Spout Magic Trainer with Handle, 9 Ounce, Twin (Colors May Vary)","These cups are great! Totally leak proof! I always shake it over the sink to make sure I have to valve/spout in correctly though! The handles are removable, and the hard spout is great for breaking the bottle. I will definitly be buying more of these! I just wish you could be 100% sure what color cups you are getting. Since we have a boy I was terrified we would receive the pink ones in the mail, but we got lucky and received the blue & orange ones!My son is 12 months old and can drink out of these without any problems!",5
The First Years - Nursing Privacy Wrap Black,"I ordered this because the picture made it look like it was a larger wrap that covers the whole baby. The material is stiff and might soften up after a few washes, and the wrap is rather short, especially if your baby is a fiesty one like mine. It sort of reminds me of a large skirt with a tie. I have tried to purchase cheaper wraps just to try them out, but now realize that it's best to just get a decent one that covers well even if it's a bit more expensive - I now have 2 useless wraps and I could have put that money together for 1 good one! Live and learn.",3
Graco Ultra Clear Analog Baby Monitor,This works well once you get it on the correct frequencies and get the squeaks out.  It actually is very good for the price.,4
"Graco RoomFor2 Stand and Ride Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis","This is a great sit n stand by Graco!  Very simple stroller, folds easy and very lightweight for a double.  My only negative is its hard to use the storage basket underneath the seats.  Also hard to strap a diaper bag onto the handlebars because it is in the way of the sitting area.  Not sure those things can be avoided.  All in all it is a very sturdy stroller.  Definitely recommend for anyone with a toddler and infant!",4
"Bumbo Baby Seat, Sitter High Chair - Blue","We picked ours up off a neighbours chuck out pile, luckily, cos the kid never really liked it. We used it maybe 7 minutes altogether & then eventually sold it on ebay for 60 bucks. They seem like a fine idea, and they are for some kids I'm sure, but yes you should try someone else's out before you invest.",3
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","This product had great ratings already, and for good reason!  It was such an easy installation (even if you aren't a do-it-yourselfer).  Directions were easy to follow, and once the adjustment tweaks are made, it works as advertised.  Gate opens and holds opened both ways.  The auto-close functionality works fantastic, and is by far my favorite feature.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.",5
Cloud B Tranquil Turtle - Aqua,I bought this for my ten month old. My three year old kept putting it in her room. Finally ordered a second. They are really pretty,5
"BenBat Travel Friends On The Go Head and Neck Support, Chic, 0-12 Months",Fits around her neck perfectly. Love the magnet that helps it to stay put. She still falls forward. Just how hard she sleeps. I added a seat pet to this and it seems to work so far. Nothing can keep her body from falling forward a little but at least she has cushion,5
Amazing Baby Jack in the Box Musical Toy,"I ordered it about three weeks ago. My Grand daughter loves it. Easy for her to play with,and the music is not to loud.",5
"Bright Starts Start Your Senses Safari Activity Gym, Spots and Stripes","My baby loves the stimulation she gets from this play gym, yet I wish the quality of the toys are a bit higher (the mirror is made out of a cheap material that the reflection doesnt work well, for example) and have more interestnig toys dangling. I think the color patterns are awesome.",3
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","My daughter loves this mobile.  We got it for her to sleep in the crip.  She loves watching her """"movie"""" before going to sleep.  It is super easy to move and take to grandma's house.  Great investment!",5
Summer Infant Dr. Mom Nail Clipper Set,"I would have returned this piece of junk hand it not been for the fact that I was able to fix the smaller nail clipper. It came off the hinge (the part that helps it twist and cut nails), but after an hour of wrestling, I fixed it.For the price, I didn't expect much, but still, I expected some value for the money. I'll just file my baby's nails for now, and use the larger nail clipper when he's older.",1
"OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Pink","We have a ten-month-old. Since the very first day, we have been looking for a wipe container to replace the cheap one comes with the wipes. The only choices we found are wipe warmers. But I don't want the ""warmer"" part. I just need a functional container to replace the flimsy ones that come with the wipes. This one is just perfect for my needs! It looks great and comes with thoughtful design: it has four tiny rubber pads on the bottom to hold it firm on the changing table. The build quality is top-notch. It has a weight plate to hold the wipes in place when you pull wipes out of it. Did I mention it look great? It also has a window to see how much wipe is left. I still keep wipes in the plastic bag, so the window may not be that useful to me. Also I would like it to be on the other side, too. I place the container right next the changing pad. It blocks the window.  But this is a very minor issue to me. I can live with it. Overall, this is must-have for parents.",5

"Dappi Waterproof 100% Nylon Diaper Pants, 2 Pack, White, Small","I used the newborn size for my twins with cloth diapers,  and then I used the size small for my toddler to potty train.  The small were a bit too small for him but he potty trained quick so I didn't bother getting a bigger size. The work great for going the &#34;old school&#34;  route,  but there are definitely better diaper covers out there.  All in all for the style I was satisfied.",4
"NUK Trendline Babytalk Learner Cup, Boy, 5 Ounce",This was the only sippy cup my child would drink out of.  We must have tried 12 different cups and she wouldn't use any of them except this one.  We now have 5 of them and I've purchased the 10 oz ones from NUK too....love them!,5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ Deluxe, Blue",Any bags work and does same job as diaper genie. I like glad flex kitchen size : scented or unscented. Your choice,5
"Gund Baby Winky Lamb Rattle, White, 4.5&quot;","It's a darling rattle but not sure you would want to leave it with your baby alone. If the baby chewed on it, specks of the little lamb's fur could get stuck in the baby's mouth. But it is adorable.",4
"Summer Infant Sleek and Secure Handheld Color Video Monitor, Grey",I recently bought this camera because my son had gotten a hold of his other one and broke it.  I bought it because a friend of mine has the summer infant model before this one and it seemed like a good camera.  I thought I was getting a step up but the picture does not look very clear.  I emailed the company to see if they had had other complaints about two weeks ago and have yet to recieve a response.  I would say it is not worth the money you pay.,3
Magic Bumpers Portable Child Safety Bed Guard Rail 48 Inch - Set of Two,So far this has been good.  My 2yr old has not fallen once off her daybed.  I would have given it 5 stars if it was covered in a material.  It seems to be just exposed foam.  Which may be the reason it stays put.  Good product.,4
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Backpack,"This pump is fine, I have no complaints about it.  But you might have trouble maintaining supply or it might take too long which is a pain if you are trying to pump at work.  It is just not as strong as a hospital grade pump.  So before you buy this pump from Amazon:1) Ask your insurance company if they will pay for or supply a pump.2) Consider buying a used Medela Lactina from eBay.  Currently they're around $300 shipped and then you need to buy a NEW kit which is around $50 on Amazon and at Buy Buy Baby or $25-30 new on eBay.When I was on maternity leave and was nursing and pumping this pump was excellent.  When I went to work I wished I had bought a used hospital grade pump.",3
"Dr. Brown's Standard Dishwashing Basket, Polypropylene",I bought this product to help with cleaning bottles in the dishwasher since I go through about 28 bottles a day with triplets. This item only holds 3 bottle pieces and it costs more on Amazon than at the store!,1
"Baby Briefcase Baby Paperwork Organizer, Mint/Periwinkle",It keeps all my baby's info in one place. I'm having a second baby and I'm purchasing it for her too. I would only make it a little wider. Other than that is perfect.,4
"Snuza Baby Monitor, Hero",The monitor has put my mind at ease! We have had one false alarm but that was because her diaper was to loose. That just lets me know that it does work!!!,5
iBaby M3 Baby monitor for iPhone,"This monitor has bugs, plenty of them.  It can be an excellent monitor if they work out the bugs.Ive used this monitor for about 15 days wasn't impressed with it.Cons:Takes too long to connect every-time the app is launched.Disconnects randomly(50 Mbps internet speed)Drains your battery.Video quality is not that that greatpros:Easy set up.Works with IOS Devices.Customer Support is good.I can see my son everywhere as long as i have an internet connection.",3
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White",These covers fit the wall well an are really easy to install. Definitely recommend!! Thank you so much !!!Jf,5
"Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, Green/Blue","I have limited space in my eat in kitchen and this seat was a toe saver! I had a large, stand-alone highchair and I kept banging my toes whenever I wasn't paying attention because it took up so much room.  This attaches to my dining chair and slides right under the table.  If it weren't for the straps, you wouldn't be able to tell it was even there.  It cleans up very easily and there are no real places for food to hide or accumulate.  My niece is able to feel like she's sitting at the table with the rest of us, too.  I have also placed it on the floor in the living room so she can have snacks & milk and be somewhat contained.  It's great to travel with when visiting family and friends for dinner and such.  I've also taken it to a few restaurants (not a germaphobe, just like my niece to sit/eat on something I KNOW is clean. Kids can get sick so easy.)",5
North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,We installed this on the banister at the top of the stairs. it came with all the hardware needed to mount on a hinge and is relatively easy to install. the installation instructions are helpful and provide accurate measurements on how to mount.Con:the gate is difficult to slide in/out to make shorter or wider.it is very difficult to unlatch the lock once it is in place.,4
Cloud B Twilight Ladybug - Pink,YOU CAN GET IT AT TOYS R US FOR $32.00 FOR STORE PICK UP. ON HERE ITS $40.00 .. :),2
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Works like a charm. Easy to carry, set up, clean. My daughter loves it at 8 months old and our niece loves the booster seat at almost 3. Great purchase.",5
"BOB Ironman Single Stroller, Yellow","I live in Europe and ordered the BOB Ironman stroller from the states as I don't seem to be able to get it over here. The Amazon price was acceptable and delivery was fantastic. I received the stroller in just two days.Assembly was unproblematic. I have not had to deal with aligning the stroller yet, as the alignment has so far been correct.My daughter was five months old when I bought the stroller and started using it for walking around parks and in town. It is very easy to push and rolls very smoothly, even on cobblestones and gravel paths. Of course, the baby bumps around a bit, but no more so than in a normal stroller, and maybe even less because of the springs.I have since used the stroller once for a very slow jog (my husband was walking next to me) on a paved, fairly straight path around a lake and that worked great. It's slightly more difficult than running without a stroller, but the luxury of having your baby with you and being able to jog when it fits your schedule and not being dependent on someone being home with the baby more than makes up for it.The stroller folds up very easily. I can collapse the stroller in seconds (both hands are required) and open it equally fast, even one handed. I line the seat with additional blankets because the fabric is rather utilitarian and not very cozy on baby's head. We have a very small hatchback (Smart for four) and I can only get the stroller in the back seat. It's too wide for the trunk, but I haven't tried it without the front wheel. As is, there is only room for the driver, a passenger, and the baby in the car seat in back next to the stroller.I do not have the car seat adapter but the baby rides well in the stroller. It can recline quite far and even when jogging I didn't have a problem with my knees hitting the back. The reclining feature itself is rather primitive, as it's only adjusted by straps which suspend the back from the frame, so there is little support - not like a bouncy seat - more like a stiff hammock, but it works. As the baby gets older and the seat can be adjusted higher, I think I will like it better.Overall I am thrilled by the freedom the stroller provides and I look forward to using it for the next couple of years. I recommend it to all joggers and wish it were more readily available on the European market.",5
Leachco Prop 'R Shopper - Shopping Cart Cover - Sage Pin Dot,This works great but the main Velcro that attaches around the cart handle will not work with every cart type.,4
Baby Luv Nightlight and Music Turtle and Animals (Black and White),"My grannies spend the week with me every other month and I love having new and exciting things for their vists. Well on their last night with me I gave them the Baby Luv nightlight . It is so much fun to see the stars and moon on the ceiling.And the music was nice too. We laughed and played till the girls fell asleep. They are 2 and 4 years old, I even sent one to my daughter in Afghanistan she told me to get her a night light that showed stars.I know she will love it too.",5
"Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White","I had babysat for a friend, watching her 1 month old son and borrowed her Boppy pillow. I was able to fall asleep on it that evening when he refused to sleep in his bassinette. Had to purchase one for myself!  Love the cover that is pale and gender neutral.",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,These do just what I wanted-keep my second story double hung windows from opening more than 4 inches.  Easy to install.  I have not had any problems with them.,4
"DaVinci Reagan 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","Bought this as a gift for our daughter.  It went together very easy, and it looks beautiful and of good quality.",5
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,This product worked really well for us.  After trying 3 other crib railing protectors we finally found this one and it's getting the job done.  Our 13 month old has learned to paritally unvelcro part of it but overall it's getting the job done (a little too late though since our entire crib rail already has teeth marks)!,4
Circo&reg; Crib Dust Ruffle - Multi Dots,I am having a grandson and grandaughter born in the same month.  Works great for a nursery for both of them.,5
"Bunnies by the Bay Buddy Blanket, Skipit",A good companion for my daughter. She attached to the bigger version as her blankie so now we have the buddy to go with it.,4
"Bella Tunno Ribbon Loop Binker Pacifier Clip, Ocean Stripes/Blue Hawaiian Stripes",Very misleading!  There is only one clip in the package.  I should have read previous reviews and I would have known there is only one clip in the package.  Otherwise the product is nice but not worth $8.,1
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),"I was a bit leery of purchasing because of the low price, but I'm glad I decide to go ahead and purchase, because these head massagers are awesome!! I wanted to get a scalp massager to increase blood circulation and stimulate hair growth. They seem pretty sturdy and well made; the ends softly massage your scalp (I've had some that were too pointy and harsh). Will definitely recommend to my friends and family",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Rusty the Robot Take Along Toy,My bb loves it! I can't go out of the house with out... It's my 6 months old best buddy!,5
"Graco Sweet Slumber Sound Machine, White","I plan to return this product if possible as the sounds that it produces were, for my husband and myself, more irritating than soothing.",1
"Kalencom Midi Buckle Bag, Calypso","Love the colors, fabric and interior. Only con is the size. Would've liked it to be bigger. I never seem to have enough room for everything I need on the go.",4
"Tiny Love Gymini Bouncer, Blue/Yellow",bought the other color for my son and it is wonderful and he loves it. bought this one for a baby shower(girl) and had a horrible time putting this one together. and to top it off it didn't have one of the toy ring holders on it .. like I said for a baby shower and didn't have time to return it...was disappointed that this one wasn't like the first one I bought.,3
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Print Boy, Large","The Halo SleepSack 100% Cotton SleepSack Wearable Blanket is adorable and functional... not to mention safe!  I received one to review and I love it!  My little guy has to be one of the world's worst about kicking the blankets off, getting cold, and then waking up.  He has also now reached the age where he grabs everything with his hands and pulls it immediately toward his face.  With the Halo SleepSack 100% Cotton SleepSack Wearable Blanket I don't have to worry that he will pull the blanket up by his face during the night while I am sleeping and being at risk for suffocation.  With the zip on design, he can't kick it off of him so I don't have to worry about him constantly kicking off the blankets and getting cold and then waking up!!  Each one has special ""Back Is Best"" embroidery to remind parents and caregivers that little ones should all sleep on their backs to help reduce the risk of SIDS! They have several new designs that are absolutely gorgeous!  They are all 100% cotton. They offer selections for boys, girls, and neutral colors!  Halo has thought of everything to help keep your baby warm and safe throughout the night.  I definitely give this product and Halo itself two thumbs up!",5
Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,"The mattress is perfect. It not only seems to be high quality, but comfortable and safe. I was happy with the quality and cost",5
"Britax Kick Mats (2-Pack, Black)","This lasted one 25 minute trip before it began to tear along the top seam. We bought it, not because our son kicks, but because his legs are getting long enough to touch the seat back and therefore get it dirty. It was not subjected to any kicking, just him putting his feet on the seat back. I expect more from a brand of this caliber.",1
Munchkin Click Lock Fresh Food Freezer Pops,"These freezer pops aren't overly big so they are perfect for my little man (8 months). The grasper is nice and wide, easy for his hands. I think each pop is only 2 oz which is just right for his appetite right now. I like to use them when his mouth hurts from teething.",4
Snuza Portable Baby Movement Monitor,"We love this thing.  We used the Angel Care with our first son and hated to load it up for spend the night trips to the grandparents.  The Snuza does everything we need it to do while being easily portable.  I use it on long car trips also.  I will say, the alarm isn't super loud.  I don't know if it is louder on the other models.  If baby is in your room it may be a problem.  If you are listening over a monitor then just turn the volume up.",5
"Summer Infant Quickchange Portable Changing Pad, Black","I got this for my daughter, who says it is very well made, and serves the purpose.",5
"Munchkin Quick Install 26&quot; Gate, Black","I bought this gate to block the stairs from my 8 month old grandson.  The gate is very easy to put in place and remove.  You can do it with just one hand, which is really important because I am often holding the kid when I need to go up stairs.  Very reasonably priced. We are very happy with this gate.",5
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","We love this spout cover.  Yes, we have the shower diverter but that is not what keeps it on.  We have a standard sized spout and it stays on just fine.",5
Baby Leg Warmers (Marshmellow),Love these for my baby girl!  Now that she's crawling everywhere they help protect her knees too.  The color is neutral enough that I've paired these with anything from navy to green outfits.  She loves them and looks totally adorable in them.,5
"DaVinci Kalani 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","This crib is very well made and the wood feels very sturdy.  It's fairly easy to put together assuming there are two of you to do it.  It does scratch kind of easy, but don't think any less than any other wood.  It will be interesting to see how it holds up over the years.",4
Meeno Baby Cool Me Seat Liner Stroller - Baby Blue,"Not sure how much &#34;cooling&#34; it does, but it certainly wicks away the moisture from baby on a hot day and keeps him dry. Super easy to install and clean, which is always a plus. Fits well in the JJ Cole Broadway stroller. Added an extra layer of plush comfort to the stroller seat, which baby seems to like. I would definitely buy this again.",4
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive",These bags are great! It was bigger than expected but it's perfect for lunches and picnics. The're even washing machine safe.,5
KidCo BabySteps Electric Food Mill - White,I was a little disappointed in this product. It didn't seem to puree the food enough for my baby to eat. It ended up being more work then helpful!,3
"Quinny 2012 Buzz Stroller, Rebel Red","I did a lot of research before buying this stroller.  I am loving it...  It is so easy to handle and steer.  Most people reviewed that the sun canopy was pathetic but I think they changed it on the new buzz as I find it works wonderfully.The buzz box is not a shopping basket but it really is nice as I can put my keys and cell phone away safely and walk to the parks without stressing about it laying on the tray, like my previous pram.It is really nice looking and I have attached the buggyboard for my 3yr old to stand at the back and the pram is very sturdy it does not fall over and it is still easily manoevered with him standing on.I love the fact that the chair is reversible.It is expensive but I was looking for a high level stroller and yes it could have come with a shopping basket and a cup holder but i knew these things before I purchased it so not too perturbed about that.Overall it really is lovely and yes I would recommend it.",4
Tupperware Bell Tumbler Sippy Cups with Seals Set of 4,"love these cups, the only downfall would be that they are difficult to get the lid on the first few times, but item was shipped and received quite quickly.",5
The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Baby Healthcare and Grooming Kit,"I gave this as a gift to my sister.  She was very pleased.  That makes me happy.  Being a mom of 5, myself, I thought it was a well put together kit of all the essentials.",5
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"Not dependable.  We are probably on our fifth one that we've returned and replaced.  We've only kept getting it as we were stuck with it from a registry and didn't want to fork out more money for a different one. Our issues: lots of static, constantly flaking out between the red warning light (off) and being on, one parent monitor went completely dead although it ""looked"" ok with the green light, and overall, just sporadic use.  Many evenings we'd sit and turn it on and off every few minutes just to make sure the baby was ok, otherwise if left on long term, it would beep with the red light which meant it wasn't working.On the good side, it does have a long range.Overall, don't buy unless you want a unit that you'll have to return or one that will flake out on you within a couple months.",1
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,"my wife bought this for my baby boy, he absolutely loves it. there's some material inside the body that crinkle and crackle when he plays with it. the hands are awesome for biting/teething. the feet dangle some loops and make squirt sounds when he squeezes them. he enjoys it in the car ride to daycare. easily one of his favorite toy (he's 9months now).",5
WubbaNub Brown Puppy,The only pacifier my son could keep in his mouth when he was little.  I now give them to all my friends as shower gifts.,5
"South Shore Furniture, Sweet Morning Collection, Changing Table, Royal Cherry",We bought this for our first baby and the size of this changing table is nice. One small issue is we thought that the drawers will be bigger but they are smaller. Took a lot of time to assemble but final product is nice.,4
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"This is my favorite bouncer.  My daughter was mesmerized by it from the very beginning.  At 3 months she still stares at the fish swimming about.  The vibration feature is great to relax and lull your little one to sleep.  The only negative thing I can comment on is the motor is a little loud, but not enough for me not to love the product.  I especially love the variety of music and nature sounds.  The Ocean Wonders line is truly ""wonderful""!",5
"Innobaby Packin' SMART Formula Dispenser and Snack Case - Lemon Frosting, iParenting Media Award Winner for Best Products 2007","This is a great product; easy to use, clean, and dispense.  I've used other formula dispensers in the past but like this one so much better.  If we're going on a short trip, I just stack a couple.  If we're going to be gone for a while, I stack all five.  Looking forward to using it for snacks later as well.  Definitely worth the cost!",5
Chicco KeyFit &amp; KeyFit30 Infant Car Seat Base - Anthracite,Needed another base for my husbands car. Worked out beautifuly!!!Would recommend this to anyone who is using the Chicco travel system!!,5
"Cocalo Removable Wall Appliques, A to Z Boy",Very cute and can be reapplied and moved around.  They haven't caused any damage to my painted walls (as of yet) and they've all stayed up so far (had them for about 2 months now).,5
"Pura Stainless Kiki Infant Bottle Stainless Steel, 11 Ounce, Natural","I wanted an alternative to plastic, but unfortunaly these bottles made me never wanna look at stainless steel again. There may be other good stainless steel bottles out there, but these are not it.Pros:Have not found one yet.Cons:bottle leaks, for two reasons; one is that the top does not screw on well, and second, the way the nipple fits into the top is not well fitted, leaving space for liquid to escape.awful metallic smell, which will not wash awaythe nipple, thought it indicates to be a step one nipple for newborns, has too fast of a flow.Poor ergonomic on the bottle, so it is not comfortable to hold or feed with.Also my baby did not like the shape of the nipple, though this is subjective.Since there are much better alternative, I do not recommend these bottles.Dr. Browns, glass bottle have been wonderful. Great nipple shape, slow flow, colic prevention,comfortable grip and no leaks.",1
"Eddie Bauer Harness, Girl Monkey","This was just the cutest little thing ever.  Never thought I'd put my kid on a 'leash', but when you have a toddler who thinks she's 10 and refuses to sit in a stroller, this is great.  Soft, cute and the tail comes off so my daughter can use it as a backpack or play with it and not worry about choking.  So cute!  Great product!",5
Babies 'R' Us Auto Sensor Night Lights - 2 Pack,I don't really have any complaints and they do what they are supposed to do. Inexpensive and worth every penny.,3
"Boppy Pillow with Luxe Slipcover, Monkey","As a breastfeeding mom, I couldn't live without my boppy. This boppy is very soft and quite comfy!  It is also nice for tummy time.",5
"Lifefactory Sippy Caps for 9-Ounce Glass Beverage Bottles, Set of 2, Raspberry and Royal Purple","I'm a huge fan of glass drinking containers and it is quite hard to find them in kid-friendly options.  That said, the mouth piece of this is not my favorite.  I would love for Lifefactory to make some more drinking / mouth piece options for their otherwise wonderful and safe sippies  and water bottles.  I would make the same comments about their adult versions.  How about something that school-aged kids can easily use?",4
"JJ Cole Car Seat Cover, Khaki",,5
Gerber Graduates Kiddy Cutlery 3 Piece Spoon Set,"My son will only use metal utensils, since that is what the rest of family uses.  These are great.  Easy to grip, dishwasher safe, and fun colors.",4
"Playtex Insulator/Playtime Cup, 9 Ounce, Colors May Vary","For those of you with toddlers, I wanted to recommend this sippy cup. I literally went through probably 10 brands of sippy cups and hated them all. And, my daughter just didn't seem to drink a lot from them. I read some reviews and found out about this one and tried it and absolutely love it. I literally bought 6 of them and threw all the other ones out (well, donated). There are three main reasons why I love this cup:1. It does NOT spill, I swear2. The parts are easy to take apart, clean, and put back (some other ones had a million tiny parts that were hard to put back together).3. It is insulated to keep liquids cold without being heavy at all. And, there is no condensation so diaper bags, etc don't get all wet.",5
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"I have a 4yr old, 3 yr old and 20 month old.  I purchased this when my second child was born so I could carry him and keep up with my 15 month old.  my second loved being held, so this helped tremendously, especially if we were going to be out with out a stroller.  and my older son loved it too!  When I had my third my oldest was only 2 1/2 so to keep my sanity we had to get out of the house, but I wasn't quite up to the task of an infant, toddler and one walking toddler,nor was I about to spend several hundred dollars on a thriple stroller to use for such a short period of time,  so I buckled the two older kids up and put my youngest in this (Which stayed in the basket when not in use).  This is absolutly the best investment I have ever made in any baby product (and I've made quite a few :)) It's a great buy too $20!",5
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat Cover Set, Onyx","We replaced our old blue all cloth cover with this one when my third child was born--the material is quality and easier to clean than the last....(perfect if you let the kids eat in the car) it looks like new again-LOVE the """"new"""" look!",5
"BRICA UV Alert Window Shade, Gray","My house faces west and in the afternoon you can hardly touch the front door.  The door has a window and I couldn't find anything to cut down the heat from that window until I found this Brica Window Shade.  It is a little smaller than the window but does a great job of cooling down the area inside the front door.  It has been sticking for the last 4 days with no slippage.  It is a little too big for my car, but I bought some other shades for those side windows.  I am including a picture of what it looks like.  I love it!",5
Hohner Kids Baby Band,10 month old Son loves to shake these and hear the sounds they make. They get thrown around a lot too and have held up well.,5
Marvel Comics Spider-Man Toddler Plush Blanket - Spiderman Webslinger Toddler Size Bed,My 3 year old son absolutely loves this blanket! He can't take a nap or go to bed without his blanket.,5
"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Fairy Tales","my three year old daughter loves sitting in this big girl chair. Car rides are a lot more fun and it really makes her feel independent to be able to climb in and out by herself. She even buckles her own seat belt! The seat belt holds her in very securely, the cushioning is comfortable, and it is not as narrow as other ones she tried to sit in. Overall, good buy --good safety features, comfy , PINK, and good price.",5
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella","This is a good quality, very nice car seat. This is the second one like this we bought as we like it so much!",5
Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat,My son loves this seat. He feels like a big boy when he gets to use the big potty all by himself. I put the hook for the seat so he can get to it on him own and so this is ideal for him and it is nice because I don't have to wash out a little potty chair. The only thing that would make it nicer is if it had handles. Not a big deal at my house because the toliet is close to a wall so he uses that for support but I think it would make him feel more secure. I would recommend this for anyone with a child who wants to use the big potty.,4
Infantino Food Press,I bought the Infantino Squeeze Station and wanted an extra press. This press doesn't even match the other press. The other press is clear. I wouldn't have bought it.,1
"Britax Advocate 65 CS Click &amp; Safe Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I bought this product after researching it for a awhile,I have another child who is 5 and is in her Britax Marathon and I love that car seat. The Advocate is a very good quality product and very safe. Don't be scared away by the extra padding on the side it's not but a couple inches more wide. I have a Britax Marathon right next to this one and they fit perfect with enough room for the person sitting on the other side...I know it's a little high price wise but your child will have it for a long time and the safety from this seat is worth it alone.",5
Wimmer Ferguson Wimmer Infant Stim Mobile To Go,"At about 6 weeks my grandson really started loving this.  Mom clipped it to an existing mobile, with the clip it is pretty versatile.  I would highly recomment it, especially for the price..",5
"BRICA Stay-In-Place Baby Mirror, Black",I was hesitant based on other reviews but bought it anyway.  I love it.  I just clip it to the visor in my truck and can clearly see my little one in the back seat now.  Soo much better and safer than pulling down my rear view mirror.,5
"Luvable Friends 4-Pack Flannel Receiving Blankets, Blue",These blankets were a part of a baby shower gift.  They were so cute.  The material is pretty good.  Nothing amazing but not to cheap.  Shipped fast.,5
Baby Einstein Caterpillar and Friends Play Gym,My son is not quite old enough to get the full effect of this toy and leaning center but I expect once he grasps it he will have fun for months to come.  It's everything I expected it to be so I am very happy.,5
"Nuby Easy Clean Bottle Brush with Suction Base, Colors May Vary","I love the idea of the suction cup--when you put it down so the bristles are not touching the countertop.  Also, I like the little nipple brush snuggled in the handle.  The one thing I could do without is the sponge part. The sponge slides around the handle a little, and I feel like sponges hold germs more and are more difficult to keep clean than the bristles.",4
KidCo Peapod Plus - Kiwi,"We have two kids who have used the pea pod tents for the last two years.  They are fantastic.  We have packed both in a large duffle with extra room for clothes on both long drives and flights.  These truly have become our kids second beds away from home - and sometimes at home.  We never have trouble getting them to sleep anywhere new because these are their spots.  We started out using them for play when I thought they were too little to sleep in them, and then at a year we transitioned the tents from play into beds no problem.  We take them everywhere - all of our vacations, hotels, camping (in our larger tent), etc.  We actually use one for my three year old who still needs to nap, but if given the chance will get out of her toddler bed and not sleep.  These have been a life saver.  I am jumping on now to buy a third for the next kid.  Can't recommend enough!  Just make sure the baby is big enough to rollover, crawl, etc. to be safe.",5
BRICA Baby In-Sight Magical Firefly Auto Mirror for in Car Safety,"It didn't worked for us I think the mirror is to small and after moving the mirror around for almost a week, we really can't see the baby.",1
Sassy Soft Cushion Play Space Interlocking Mats,This is very small.  My 5 month old rolls right off of it.  I had this on my baby registry so we got it for free and that I am thankful for but i would not recommend this to anyone.  The foam is thick so that is good but the shapes don't stay flat if your child takes them out and puts them back together a lot like my nieces do.Off to buy an alphabet mat now.,3
"Bobo Buddy Baby Pacifier Holder Plush Toy, Caterpillar",I like this product for use with a different type of passified but my son loves his WannaNub Monkey and Giraffe better.,3
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Crib Sheet, Up, Up &amp; Away Elephant","The material is exactly what you would expect from Aden + Anais - incredibly soft and breathable.  The colors are just as shown in the picture, keep in mind that the fabric makes it a little sheer so you will want to get a white mattress pad cover.  I washed once before putting on my crib and it held up well.  Fits a Pottery Barn standard mattress.",5
"Manhattan Toy Beads Wood Rattle, Classic",I was looking for another sensory toy and found this at pottery barn.  Was way cheaper on Amazon and my son really likes it.  I put it around his wrist or ankle and he shakes or kicks it.,5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow",Product appears in good shape and arrived on time. Cannot specify how well it works since it is a gift but price was better than other places.,5
"Bright Starts Rattle and Shake Barbell Rattle, Pretty in Pink",So I paid to have this item gift wrapped(more money) and it DID NOT happen!!!!!!!!! What a waste of money and time.. Lesson learned don't pay to have this done by this company.........,1
Cutie Pie Holiday Baby Bibs 10/pk,The bibs were clearly advertised as holiday bibs.  What I received were a package of 10 bibs; 5 with holiday designs and 5 with no decoration whatsoever.  This was not what I expected.,3
Toy Storage - Chain Gang (White) (6' L),It is just a simple chain... but it help me decluttered my daughter's room in minutes.,5
"babyletto Madison Swivel Glider, Mocha","This is the 3rd item I've purchased from Babyletto.  The first was a crib, next a drawer set, and now the glider.  I like the modern look of their items for a reasonable price.  Unfortunately, this company has a huge problem with their packaging.  All three of these items were delivered in very poor conditions: broken and chipped pieces and torn up packaging.  This last time, I simply told UPS that I could not accept the glider because the box was completely destroyed.  It's too bad Babyletto has this problem because their baby furniture is very nice.",3
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,"It works, it's not as stable as it looks, but that probably depends on the carseat & the child. It did it's job though!",4
Bright Blossoms One size Adjustable Cloth Diaper double hip snaps 6pcs Pack Fitted Pocket Washable with 6 Inserts,"I initially was not sold on the idea of cloth diapers. The cleaning, and time involved seemed to be semi-hassle. However, I am now a fan after using the pocket diapers for about a year. I have tried different brands that have similar properties. Lets start off, not all cloth diapers are made with the same quality even if they have the same prints or colors.I have tried brands like baby city, baby land, and oh baby ka. Those are less in price but the quality is not the same. The material is not as good nor is the craftsmanship. Anyhow, I like this cloth diapers because for the price they give a comfortable fit for our baby and we combine the inserts 2 pieces hemp cotton and one microfiber. They work well and we have saved tons of $ on diapers and saving the environment is always a plus. The designs are nice our grandson will point to the animals on the diaper print. The snaps are easy to configure and pocket elastic on the top helps hold in the insert. Also it's been a year and the diapers still hold together very well definitely can go round 2 for the second child.",5
Infantino Sync Comfort Wrap Carrier Black/Red,There is lots of material. The concept is great but too time consuming. My opinion is Ergo is the way to go!,1
"Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory",I really like this pillow. I can't sleep on one side for the whole night so I was looking for a pregnancy pillow that didn't need to be re-adjusted every time I turn over.  This pillow supports my back and my hips. The only down side is it doesn't really support my belly all that well.  I have to use another pillow for that.,5
"Skip Hop Central Park Outdoor Blanket, Chevron","The purse that can be zipped to the blank is convenient to keep car keys and small purse.  You should keep the packaging until you have memorized how to fold back into the messenger bag.  Love how handy it is to use when I want to watch a soccer game and sit next to the field, hang out on the beach or park if I do not want to bring a chair.  Easy to clean since plastic on one side and hard canvas on the other side.",4
"Peg Perego Convertible Infant to Toddler Car Seat, Black","I tried 3 other car seats in the rear facing mode and this is the only one that fit. It fits well in all of our family vehicles including grandmas and in the rental car we had on vacation. People in the front seat don't have to have their knees jammed into the dashboard to keep this seat in the proper position. Once I found a convertible seat that would actually fit in my car, I was concerned about how well my very tall baby would fit in it. He out grew the infant car seat when he was 6 months old and now at 15 month he still has lots of room for growth, and I doubt we'll have any issues with leg room before he turns two. It is well made with lots of padding for my little guy. I like that the seat doesn't block his view. The straps are easily adjustable and very easy to loosen when taking him out. The straps occasionally sticks when trying to tighten but not enough to be a real problem.This seat meets all of the US and European safety standars that was a plus for me. I couldn't find this car seat locally and the seller on Amazon doesn't ship to my location so I had it shipped to my moms and paid an additional $150 to have it shipped here. It was still worth the extra cost.",5
"Sumersault Pop Dot 10 Piece Crib Set, Tan/Green/Orange","Love it. The bedding is adorable. We bought it for our son's nursery- and didn't use all the pieces that came in the bag, but really liked it. It is nice because it has color to use for other inspiration for the bedroom. Really happy with our purchase :) Recommend to anyone !",5
"Eddie Bauer Sport Stroller, Blue Glacier","The only thing good about this stroller this that it is light weight. THATS ALL!!!! Its caps on the back wheels kept falling off so my husband put superglue on them to stay on. The parent tray is too small only fits 1 bervage/bottle. The side rails dont have any protective covering, so my 9 month baby girl ended up hitting her head on it. Looks nice but not a good buy!!!!!!!!",3
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Apple, Infant","I bought two of these a light blue one and a light pink one when my twins were infants.  I wished I had known about these when my other two children were little.  Speaking as a mother of four and of multiples, these were the best investment ever.  The bottom stays in the bottom of the infant carrier and the top zips onto it.  This was so convenient and nice and warm for the baby.  I did purchase the hats too but they were too small so if you do not have a newborn do not invest in these.  My twins were born in May they were tiny but the hats didn't fit that fall.  I love these and tell everyone that's  having a baby about these.",5
Pearhead Babyprints Photo Frame,"I must say that although the first time this product arrived the glass was broken, exchanging it was very easy and we are very pleased with the product. The frame is very sturdy, the overall quality of the piece is high and it is just plain cute! I hesitated buying it because so many people said they had shipping problems and even though I did as well, I am still glad I ordered it because Amazon made it very easy to exchange the broken one and it looks absolutely perfect in our nursery!",4
"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso",I ordered this crib for my son. I LOVE LOVE this crib. It is perfect. Well built & very nice. Looks great in the nursery. Would recommend!,5
Jolly Jumper Stroller Caddy - Stroller Handlebar Organizer,This works great with our UB Vista - my only issue is the obnoxious Jolly Jumper logo that stares to in the face. Easy to assemble and I'm able to open & close my stroller without having to continuously remove it.,4
"Wallstickersusa Wall Stickers, Santa is It Too Late To Be Good","I loved the look, it was very cute. I am only giving 3 stars, though, because the letters are very thin. I tore 2 while removing from the backing, despite being careful. Most of the letters tore when removing from the wall, making it one use only.",3
"Britax Marathon Convertible Car Seat, Granite","we love this car seat. i was afraid it would be too big, but fits in our prius and even in our beetle if the front seat is pushed forward. its easy to install although its heavy to carry.we got it for $[...] plus free shipping at travelingtikes.com. I saw that in another review here and was so glad because its such a great deal. they only have certain fabrics at this price. we got the zebra and love it.",5
Summer Infant Sure And Secure Expansion Gate,"We had this gate for 1 year before it just recently broke.  We knew it wasn't the best, but there are VERY few gates to cover 70 in.  The anchors it came with were plastic, so my husband used anchors rated for over 100 pounds so the weight of the gate wouldn't pull out of the wall.  That wasn't what broke.  The chinsy little plastic mechanism it swings on is what broke.  Also, the gate does not contract within itself when you open it, so it takes alot of space to clear in the room.  The closing latch starting sticking several months ago.  We put off replacing the gate because there are so few options for that large of a doorway.",2
Lamaze Soft Chime Garden Musical Toy,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter when she was two-months-old. At the time, it was one of the few toys she really had any interest in. She's now nine-months-old and still enjoys this toy. I have to say that I think I enjoy playing with it even more than she does. The setting with individual chimes instead of songs is fun to mess around with. My daughter enjoys the different songs that the other settings play. This is a really neat toy and doesn't become annoying as many infant toys do.",5
New Boba Wrap in Red with Matching Carrying Pouch : Infant Baby Carrier : Preemie - 18months (Previously Sleepy Wrap),"This is a must have! Extremely comfortable and my baby loves being snuggled close to me. It does get a bit warm, but I expected that as my baby is right up against me.",5
Sassy Baby Food Pantry Organizer,"Loved this organizer! Takes up a small footprint on the counter and I was able to keep all my daughters food sorted and organized. As she got older and had more of a selection, I P-touched the rows to state breakfast, lunch, dinner, fruits, and veggies. It was helpful when I had someone else watching her as they would know what to feed her.  It was also helpful at a quick glance to know exactly what I was low on and needed to replenish.  Would definitely buy and recommend to a friend. I used this for Earth's Best Baby Food and all stages fit well.",5
Nest Diaper Bags Grommet (Toffee),I love it. it's really very well done but a bit to wide for me. But I don't think it's a big problem it should be rather spaceful for my and baby staff. Anyway the leather is so soft and have a zipper pocket that you can take off and wear this bag as a usual one.,4
Tommee Tippee Explora Li'l Sippee Trainer Cup 2pk 7-12 Months 10 Ounces - Girls (Colors/styles May Vary),I ordered purple and pink but received yellow and blue. I was very angry but decided not to deal with return. I went to Amazon and wrote a review that was deleted the next day.My second review was deleted without a reason too! BEWARE!,1
Sock Ons Clever Little Things That Keep Baby Socks On! 6 - 12m (Turquoise),"terrific!  wish we had these with our son.  our daughter is 19 months, and we still use them because she likes to pull off her socks all the time.  we've never had a problem with them not fitting as one of the reviews mentions.  they are fabulous!",5
Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump,"I'm amazed.  I wanted to buy an electric pump, which all my friends recommended, but decided to give this one a try, and I'm happy I did.  Such a saving compared to electric pump!  And it's very convenient and pretty quick.  Easy to assemble, easy to wash, easy to use.  Just great!",5
"Carter's Forest Friends Wall Decals, Tan/Choc","These wall decals are a fast and easy way to add some cute art to your baby's room. My six year old son actually did most the placement of these in his little brother's room, they are virtually impossible to mess up and he was so happy to help get ready for the baby. The package came with enough decals for us to make a main mural and then place some animals, mushrooms, and acorns above the changing table and a shelf in the room. The images and colors would be great for a boy r girl's room and are not too babyish that they would want them removed until they get much older. We also purchased the matching canvases witht he owl and fox and they look great in the room with the murals.",5
Uncle Goose Chinese Character Blocks (32 pcs),"I bought these Chinese blocks for the three boys (3 y.o. and under) that I nanny for. The first time we opened the box and began to play, the 3 y.o. said, &#34;These are our favorite!&#34; over and over. The blocks have been a hit ever since. They love learning the number and animals. We haven't gotten to writing the characters yet, but I am excited to teach them that. Also, the pieces can be put together to form a map of China, the Chinese flag, a dragon and the word for China in English and Chinese.The couple things that I would say as a &#34;negative&#34; about these blocks would be that the edges are not rounded, so they can hurt if they are thrown across the room. Also, there is pinyin (pronunciation system) for the animals on the blocks, however there is no pinyin provided for the numbers. Thankfully, I know Chinese, so I am able to help them with that.(For anyone who would like to know how to pronounce the numbers, I recommend getting the free app called &#34;Pleco.&#34; Just type anything in and there is a button you can push to hear the pronunciation.)Overall, a mostly perfect buy for my 3 boys. Great fun and great for learning!",5
"Mommys Helper Cushie Traveler Folding Padded Potty Seat with Carry Bag, White with Frog Design","I was hesitant to buy it due to some of the negative feedback about these folding seats, but if you use the seat properly, you will never have a problem.The seat is to be placed towards the absolute back of the host toilet seat - this reinforces the back fold and prevents any sort of collapse.  Follow the directions and you will be just fine.  Makes even the shadiest of public toilets bearable.The included carry bag is great for keeping germs where they belong.",5
American Baby Company Quilted Fitted Waterproof Fitted Cradle Mattress Pad Cover,"Perfect fit, nice thickness, plush, exactly as described.  Used in a jenny lind cradle.  The mattress is not plush at all, so this cover adds the extra softness that baby needs.",5
,"We have an open floor plan where our living room meets the kitchen. This left a huge gap between the walls that a conventional gate would never cover. This gate was super easy to install with a drill. Instructions were clear, but would recommend keeping them somewhere for later reference in case you have to reinstall in a new home or area. Its very sturdy and our little boy cant figure out as well as some of our visitors! Pretty entertaining to watch adults try to get past it. Once you know how to open it correctly though its easy.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I could not understand why a baby's toy would be so expensive,  but caved into the hype and bought it for my daughter. She loved it and we took it with us everywhere.It is soft, durable plastic and has no stinky,  plastic odor.",5
"HALO Sleepsack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Blue Jungle Print, Small",I love the HALO sleepsacks!  This is the fourth one I have bought. I had 2 smalls and 3 mediums as my baby grew. They are great because they give her the extra warmth of a blanket but she can't get caught up in it and suffocate. I am just getting ready to purchase the larger size for her as she is getting just about to big for the mediums. I will continue to use the HALO sacks until she is at least 1 if not longer.  It has been integrated into her nap and bedtimes so she knows that it about time to sleep when she gets zipped into her sleepsack.  Definitely recommend them for all babies!,5
"Bambino Mio Nappy Bucket and Lid, White","I was very pleased with this product. I read the reviews carefully, and eyed the dimensions.Personally I sometimes feel a limited connection with some moms, because most have their own home and more space for things. I live in a small apartment, where space is precious. It's what I would call cozy, but potentially messy if not kept organized. So you can imagine my anxiety about going the cloth diaper route!This pail helped alleviate a lot of that anxiety. I love the handle so I can easily carry it from spot to spot, even out to the coin operated laundry and not feel awkward. It IS in the smaller range of things, so be sure you pull out a ruler and understand the dimensions.. however, I never understood the big, bulky trash cans passed off as diaper cans anyway, and my logic was, the bigger the can, the more likely I would be to allow cloth diapers to pile up for an unecessary amount of time and then have to fish them out. This perfect little pail doesn't draw unecessary attention to itself either, and I don't feel like I have to devote a large amount of space to it. It can fit right in my bathroom, next to the toilet if I chose.Would most definitely recommed to a cloth diapering mom who intends to do her loads fairly regularly (probably not as accomodating for moms who are going to wait every few days though or may not have a lot of time). As I said, read the dimensions and decide how often you intend to use cloth diapers and how many. I myself will be using the starting recommended of 24, and will be using disposables occasionally when out, plus since I am a stay at home mother, I will have a little more leeway with getting laundry done than some.Hope this helps. :)",5
HABA Kringelring Rattle Clutching Toy,"My daughter loved this teether since she was 4 months old.  It was the first toy she was able to transfer from one hand to the next -- a big milestone as any mom will tell you!  It was a favorite for a long time.  She's a year old now, and the Haba Ring is still in great shape after much abuse (7 teeth by 9 months!).  Would highly recommend this...  I include it in all my shower gifts.",5
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"Cleans easily, travels easily. It was a great transition from high-chair to big table. My son calls it his big-boy chair.",5
Mommy's Helper Slide-Lok Bi-Fold Door Lock,I was a little skeptical about ordering these but they work great! No pinched fingers and clothes stay on their hangers! I would recommend these to everyone.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"Seriously, when you ask your baby if she wants to play in the jumparoo, and she laughs and makes happy excited sounds, you will know you did right to buy this thing. The set up was pretty simple, and we had it assembled in a few minutes. It is a stable jumparoo rather than a rolling one, which i think is a nice feature personally. The seat seems pretty comfortable. We noticed that our daughter seems to lean forward in it a bit, but i think that is really more because she wants to look more closely at the various playthings that surround her rather than any crafting imbalance. The seat does rotate, which really brings this thing to life once your baby figures it out. Two of the three knobs on the top of this have little dolls suspended from them (a toucan and some sort of spotted frog). The other stuff is separated in thirds...the primary third has a little monkey, an elephant, and a bird. This section also has the audio controls...pretty much any direct contact will set off a bunch of animal sounds, and of course, messing with each individual animal releases its song, which is encapsulated within a little ditty that accompanies the animal noises. Let me tell you....it can be annoying, but you can easily tune it out. Our daughter though just adores it. She jumps up and down, swats and spins the animals, and just laughs and laughs at the noises and music that comes from it. The second section is a larger spinner with a crocodile inside, and the last third is an even larger spinner with a smiling sun. Our daughter like them as well, although it seems like she appreciates them as little diversions before getting back to the main play section.So, all in all, judging from our daughter's reaction to this jumparoo, i would say definitely get one. You will be well rewarded with a happy feeling as you watch your baby have oodles and oodles of fun. I think it also helps with a baby's development of leg and back strength as well as their hand eye coordination from what i have observed.One note though...this is no substitute for your presence...although fun. our daughter will generally want out after a half hour or so. You can only swat a little elephant so many times in one stretch it seems, lol. So, great for when your baby is bored, and possibly you need to get the laundry folded or something, but it isnt a babysitter.Anyway,Enjoy!",5
CoCaLo Sugar Plum Waste Basket,"The product looks like the picture, I read a review that stated this basket was heavy but I do not believe this basket is heavy at all.  It is light, pretty and goes with the rest of the decor for my daughter's room.",5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I have waited a little over 6 months since I purchased this stroller to write a review.All in all it is a great stroller, the metal tubing which makes up the body is rectangular rather than round making it VERY much more sturdy than one of a different design.My main complaint with the stroller is the fact that you have to strap a baby car seat in, it doesn't snap in. It works that way for the first year you have a baby in it, but I would rather it snap in instead of having to mess with straps and buckles.As a man of roughly 6ft tall, I hate strollers as a general rule, they are far too short and I end up hurting my back when pushing them because Im hunched over the whole time. This one isn't like that and that is the big bonus for me, its 3 to 4 inches taller than a standard handle so I can stand upright when pushing.Its rather large and cumbersome but not overly so. The back seat slides freely so the kid in the back can sit or stand depending on their liking. I haven't decided if I like that or not.All in all it is still one of the best strollers I have found despite my issues with it, Ill be using it for years to come.",4
Kleenex Splash'N Go Hand and Face Wash Wipes 35 Count (Pack of 8) 280 Total,"These are great for keeping in my desk at work, in bag while traveling, and in my car. I use them after pumping gas or in the middle of the day to wipe my face.The packaging is nice on these compared to other similar products. The moisture is maintained for a long time after opening the package, and it's very easy to open and close.",5

Ring Snuggies ~ Ring Sizer / Assorted Sizes Adjuster Set of Six Per Pack,"These seemed like they would be the perfect solution for a ring I have that's too large, but they are so uncomfortable! I tried it for a day, but it scratch the finger that I wore it on as well as any other skin that it happened to com in contact with.  It's also really bulky under your ring, so you can constantly feel it. It's also too small to fit around a wedding band set, so you would have to wear 2 which would make it extra bulky. Not a great solution...",1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","I recieved the Bjorn as a gift and it is one of the most benifical product in my collection of baby essentials.  This is my first child and didn't realize how difficult simple tasks, ex: making a sandwhich, would become.  This not only frees up my hands, but is a life saver when he wants to nurse, and dinner is on the table.Another benifit is my son is less fussy because he is comfortable laying against me.  He's still is getting used to his stroller, which means he's still scared of it.  The bjorn makes going out in public possible.",5
Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Silicone Nipple - Fast Flow - 2 Pack,good and perfect .i love it this is my second time i used it's easy for the mother i recommended .,5
"Comotomo Baby Bottle, Green/Pink, 5 Ounce, 2-Count",My daughter is having to pump and then feed with a bottle and was having difficulty with the Brown's bottle and one other kind and after I ordered these bottles life which much less stressful. I would recommend them to anyone.,5
"Summer Infant Secure Surround Play Safe Play Yard, Tan","I use this mostly to block areas, such as the entry to the front porch. This keeps the kids as well as the dog from leaving the porch or any other areas. Comes assembled and ready to use out of the box.",5
BabyPlus Prenatal Education System,"I have to say that I was skeptical when I purchased this product but now I'm so glad I did. My daughter was born in October of 2008, and she was indeed very alert and till this day a great sleeper. But the most beneficial aspect I believe is that she is developmentally advance. She started talking at 7 months by the time she was one she was speaking in full sentences. She has an incredible memory before we go to the grocery store I just tell her what we need to get and she will remember everything I said. She loves for me to read books to her and she has about 50 books that she can read from memory. She loves music and playing musical instruments. She can also create instruments out of almost anything. I can go on for days about my daughter but as a preschool teacher I can say that my two year knows and can do about 90% of what the 3-5 year olds that I teach can do. I cant say for certain that had I not purchased the baby plus my daughter would have been as smart but I believe that it works and I will definitely use it again.",5
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty",Love the seat cuz it has lots of cushion and Padding. East to use and assemble. Bulky in car thought. Love the color too,5
"Munchkin Wood and Steel Designer Gate, Dark Wood/Silver","I would purchase this product again and I recommend it to others. My only reservation is that it is not as applicable to doorways with very wide openings. When fully extended, as mine needed to be, it loses some of its stability. Otherwise, it is very attractive and easy to assemble.",4
"Arm's Reach Ideal Arc Original Co-Sleeper Bedside Bassinet, Natural","Ok, I admit, that setting it up could have been easier.  It took two of us. However, now that it's in use, I cannot imagine my life without it.  I love the fact that it fits so securely to our bed, nothing can get between it and our mattress unless I purposely shove something (like the sheets) in between there.  I can easily pick up our baby and soothe her or nurse her.  It's also incredibly easy to calm her by reaching my hand over and stroking her little head.  I can also sit up in bed, slip a &#34;chuck&#34; between her and the crib sheet, and change her diaper.  Believe me, when the pains of having just delivered a baby are still screaming between your legs, having the ability to attend to your baby without getting up constantly - is essential!  The co-sleeper looks nice, doesn't need the additional waterproof mattress liner (mattress already is waterproof enough), but it's important to buy extra sheets (not standard crib sheets either). A talented seamstress could sew additional sheets, but they require quite a bit of detail on the underside (velcro, loops, button holes...) to attach to the co-sleeper properly. One sheet does come with the co-sleeper purchase.Noteworthy: having a high bed isn't a problem with the extension pieces.",5
BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector,"Fits our 2014 Ford Explorer perfectly. Easy access to the LATCH clips in the seat, recommend.",5
Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor,"I was one of those moms who originally said, ""I do not need this thing.  What's wrong with the good, old-fashioned monitor?  Her room is only 10 feet away!"". I did not understand how obsessed I would be with the camera monitor until I started to sleep train my LO at 5 mo.  It is nice to see how she is doing while she is getting herself to sleep and calming down.  I can see if her eyes are open and I can see her chest is moving up and down (I know...new mom, SIDS paranoid).  And, all the while, I do not risk waking her by opening her door.  You will not regret this purchase!  And amazon has the best price!Pros -- camera is good quality (night vision is wonderful)- sound is great- love the features of the monitor (zoom, scan, option to add more cameras, sound level indicator)- wall mount optionCons (if you want to even call them that) -- Finding the perfect place to put the monitor in the room is a challenge (to see her from all angles, positions in the crib), but I think we will wall mount it to resolve.- extra base for camera uses disposable batteries (10 hours of use). I wish that they were rechargeable.  10 hours is not even one night.- ""talk back"" feature is unnecessary now, but we may use it as she gets older.  TBD.If Summer were to put a thermostat feature on this monitor, I think I would die and go to heaven!  :)",5
The Heavenly Stroller,"My husband and I are both over 6 feet tall and this is the prefect umbrella stroller for us. We hate umbrella strollers because we end up walking hunched over, but this stroller brings the handles up to our height.We bought this stroller for our first child over 3 years ago and we are currently on our 3rd child - who is now ridding in this stroller. It has held up really well.2 small complaints: 1) the handle is hard to raise and lower. The buttons are stiff. But, we just set it and never moved it again. 2) There is a break on the front wheels that always seem to fall and lock the wheels. It's annoying. I just pulled them off. I'm just using this on city sidewalks and in the mall - I don't really need the front breaks anyway.1 bonus: Because of the shape of the arms when they are raised it causes a place for you to hang bags right on the stroller. We use this extra bar space all the time.",5

Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"This was great.  It was not only cute- but it made my son happy. It was often the only way he would take long naps.

My husband wished there was one for him as well.We were very happy with this swing.",5

"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue","Babies are used to being 'swaddled' in the womb so why wouldn't they want to be when they are born? And, you just can't swaddle the baby like the nurses do at the hospital with just a little blanket. This takes the brains out of everything with easy to place velcro. One thing I recommend is to by them new. I bought a few off of ebay used and the velcro needs to be sticky. They lose their stickiness over time. They are awesome!!!",5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Warning! Do not purchase this toy. My child has gotten her ankle and arm stuck in the rings of this toy.

"American Baby Company Organic Cotton Interlock Crib Sheet, Natural","I love, love, love this sheet!  It is soft, fits on the mattress well, and organic; total package! It feels more like a cross between a flannel and knit sheet rather than a traditional cotton sheet.  I have been using it for about 4 months now, and have not had any problems with it shrinking as other reviewers have.  Overall, I would highly recommend it.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Got it as expected. My doorway opening is almost 40 inches and it fits exactly what it says. Only problem I faced is, the type of material, metal. My LO has just fell on the gate and got hurt in her head :(, luckily nothing happened, but we have to be very careful in future so as she won't get hurt. Why can't the gate be in Plastic? As it is is mainly used for babies, it should be made from soft material. But apart from that, it serves well what it is supposed to be.",4
"Graco Glider Petite LX Gliding Swing, Forecaster","As a mother of four, let me tell you, we have had many swings in our house!  My children are all older now, but this is awesome for traveling!  Move it room to room or take it to grandma's house!  I love that it is low to the ground as well!  Some reviewers complained about the ""noise""? I didn't find it noisy at all.  Babies adjust to noise and compared to three siblings running around the house, this was nothing!  :-) Seriously, I am giving it a five star review because it is portable, suits a boy or girl, does everything the product says it will do! You can't beat that!",5

"GroVia Organic Stay Dry Booster 2 Pack, White",I purchased these to try and make my stay dry pads last over night. They don't add much of a boost to the pad. They are durable but suck for their actual use. I ended up buying some hemp boosters and they work much better with the grovia liners. This is the only product of grovias that I don't absolutely love.,2

"Munchkin Star Fountain, Colors May Vary","Everything everyone else has posted is true.  Would have been super sweet if it had lasted.... our boy loved it!!!

"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","I drive a G37 coupe (think sports car) and having the infant carrier in that car was pretty much a nightmare. We have an evenflo in our other car, and I knew it would not fit in my car, no way, no how. I asked around to all of my friends who had kids a little older than mine and one suggested this car seat. (Which used to be called Sunshine Kids) She happens to have a Britax and this one, and said ""Hands down this one is better. I wish I had 2""Here's what I like:1. You can fold it pretty much flat for air traveling (I suggest getting the extra bag accessory, but it's not necessary)2. The sides are not bulky so your child can see around and not get frustrated that he/she can't see out of the window or look at the passenger next to them.3. Fits BEAUTIFULY in a small car! It has a low profile seat (the butt is only about 3"" off of the actual seat of the car) less bumped heads, and my son can climb in and out by himself at 1.5 yr old. (And for a tall SUV - we have a Tahoe- it would be much easier to get the kid in and out, especially if you are shorter like me at 5'5). Our evenfow has a bulky bottom and sits about 6-8"" above the seat, making it sometimes difficult to get our son in there especially when he is fighting it.4. All of the connectors the chest strap connector & the seat belt insert are very easy to work, feel high quality and the tighten and release is so easy to work. (I have heard mothers complain about this, and I know because our Evenflow, is a pain to tighten as much as needed)5. It will grow with my child, I can already tell it will last him at least several years, it's rated to 120 lbs, not sure that would work but does look like he has room to grow a lot.6. I find it easy to install in my G37, but it's a newer model car, the anchors are easy to work.7. You can add up to 4 cup holders.8. (This one could be a pro or con depending on the person but I think it's a plus) The seat is made of mostly steel. It's a heavy 24 lbs. I like this because it feels safe and secure, and I don't feel like it flexes like the plastic car seats. Plus I live in Texas It get's hot here, for some reason I just have a gut feeling that steel holds up better in the heat than plastic.Cons:1. It can be heavy to carry in an airport, but I just look at that as more calories burned. AND it folds up, unlike a britax or other brands and has a shoulder strap, so is still seems superior over the other options.We are planning to give the Evenflo to the grandparents since they would not have to use it every single day, and replace the seat in our other car with this one.I have mine installed Front facing although I know there is an option for rear facing, I have not tried it.Parting words, Yes, it's a little more expensive but it's definitely WORTH THE MONEY!!!!",5
BabyPlus Prenatal Education System,But I had a very active baby and it literally made him move so much it made me sick. I eventually stopped using it because the movement became so erratic it seemed like it was scaring him.,2
"Mam Nipples Slow Flow, 0+ months, 2 pack",I have used MAM bottles for two babies so far... each of them had issues with spitting up while we were in the hospital (when they give you those bottles with the formula in them already) ... when we got home I switched my kids to the mam bottles and instantly they were much much better with spit up issues.  recommend them to all my friends!,5

"OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Pink","The concept is great, however the product comes with NO instructions, not even a diagram.So I was not sure if I should leave the wipes in the plasic refill package or take them out of the bag.If you do take them out of the package and put them in the dispenser, the wipes will start to dry out rather quickly.It could be a workable item, but you would need to find refill packages that actually fit inside it and then fiddle with the opening in the refill package to properly dispense.Overall, it looks nice, but just using the wipes straight out of the refill packages is more cost effective and gives a better seal to keep the wipes moistYes it worked with all types of wipes, the one I had seemed to have either a defective latch or a defective gaskget since our wipes kept drying out, I would suggest leaving the wipes in the plastic refill package if you buy the 80 count sized refill wipes, and just set the refill package inside the dispenser.Warning, even a short drop, like if a toddler picks it up and drops it, can break the latch mechanism",3
Graco Backless TurboBooster Car Seat in Chatter,"Due to differing laws regarding child seats in different states, we happen to be legal without them here in NH. However, our parents live in IL, where seats are going to be required for several more years. On a recent trip to IL in which we flew to Chicago, we realized that it was actually cheaper to buy new seats for my twins and ship them to my mother-in-law's house than it was to pay the ridiculous airline baggage fees each way. This way, too, we could leave the seats there for the next few years and not worry about it.This is a great basic seat, perfect for what it is. The seats we do still tend to use here at home, even though they aren't required, are also Graco. They are a little nicer, having a tempurpedic type seat stuffing material that is more comfortable, but they are the convertible bottom portion of the full backed booster style that was significantly more expensive.For a secondary seat, these are perfect. They were very economical and work great. The basic pattern is better for my nearly 7 year olds than the character patterns which they are already pretty much beyond.I believe that the covers are washable, but of course as these are sitting in IL and were only used for 4 days, I can't comment on that part of it.My children always enjoy having their own cupholders, too. These in the seat are easier to reach than the ones in our van, for sure, and my mother-in-law's car doesn't have them in the back seat.I really recommend this as a replacement or secondary booster.",4
Evenflo X Sport Convenience Stroller - Grey,"This stroller has so many great features. We only have a car, so sometimes it's tough to fit our regular stroller in the trunk with all the other things we have to take with us.  This is awesome because it's so compact, yet it still has a basket, cup holders, a carrying pouch and a shade. It doesn't lay down or anything, so you do want your child to be holding him/herself up well before using this stroller (probably 6 months or so). My only complaint is that it's a little shorter than I'd hoped.  I do sort of wish I'd held off and paid the extra $10-15 for the Convenience Plus with adjustable height handles.  I'm 5'9"", and it's not terrible but would be more comfortable to push if the handles were a couple inches higher.  All in all, I would say this is an excellent value!",4
"Dreambaby Extra Wide Car Window Shade, Black, 2 Pack",This works with our Denali and with our jeep.  It stays in place and blocks the sun well.  I would like two more.,5
Bright Starts Kashmir Ingenuity Smart and Quiet Swing,"I bought this for my fourth child. I have owned everything from the Zen swing to the self propelled and nothing compares with this model.  Easily put together, in minutes, the fabric seemed a bit thin when I first touched it but I found it allowed my child to not overheat in the swing when all bundled up, so what at first seemed a tad 'cheap' turned out to be very good.  I have had this product for 9 months now and have NO complaints... nothing has broken or malfunctioned, it is still in perfect working order and it still has the first set of batteries I put in it!! SHOCKER! I love it !! Folding it is easy which I did often , easy to clean and transport, son loved it.. wish this was around for the other 3!! those big huge clunkly swings although 'sturdy' took up way too much room and were hell to take anywhere.. this was a breeze!",5

We have the 20&#34; Eebee doll, the bathtime (tub toy) Eebee, all the Eebee DVDs, the Eebee iphone/ipad app, & the last thing we needed was this Shape-Fits Eebee. We were so excited to snag the last one this March. We've been looking for quite a while.All of the Eebee products are VERY, VERY well made. & insanely adorable. This toy is amazing. It's very easy to see why it won all the awards it has (:I definitely recommend it to any mommy or daddy with a baby or toddler.",5
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 3 Pack Graduates Kiddy Cutlery Set, Colors May Vary","Bought this for our 22 month old granddaughter and she is learning to use the fork, the knife will come much later.

"Baby Girl Pink Initial Sip N' Munch, Letter G","the cup is cute but its not for small baby hands and wasnt designed with the same sturdiness as other baby cups.  the whole thing comes apart when dropped.cute but only past a certain age.  in all honesty, i think it'd be better marketed to bigger kids--maybe like elementary school age--and not even toddlers.  buying this for a baby is not a good idea.  my daughter is 13 months old, by the way.",3
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","These gates (I bought 3) are the best I've ever used.  They are very simple to install, function well, although they don't always lock behind me, and they look great.  The style fits perfectly in our home and we've gotten many compliments on them.  Now we feel we have the function  and security we need without making our house look like daycare!  Love them!",5

Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,I didnt think i would really need one of these pilklows considering that my belly was so small at 5 months. But I got tired of the sleepless nights due to lack of support. Since making this purchase I am able to sleep more comfortably (especially since the belly has grown a bit). the only drawback is that every time I want to roll over i have to wake up and adjust the pillow.,5
Maclaren Triumph Stroller - Color: Scarlet,"It is lightweight, easy to carry and seems very quality, additionally you can drive it with single hand.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,We got these gates when our son started walking at 9 months. Our house has a floor plan where you can walk in basically a circle through all the downstairs rooms. We needed to keep him in the living room so we bought 2 gates to take care of 2 doorways. It is a pressure mounted gate and very easy to install. I put up both gates in less than half an hour.They are very sturdy and will adjust to the width of the doorways. We did not know that our doorways were different sizes until we put these in. Our son can't budge the gates even though he trieds and the step to open it is great. I am way too short for any of the gates you have to step over.These are pretty portable too. We take they too my mom's when our son stay there on weekends. I would buy these again in a second. I believe they will last past our next child too.,5
"Slingezee Baby Sling Black, Regular","My infant looved the moby but I wasn't able to continue breastfeeding her and walking around with her comfortably after her 3rd month.  So, I bought an upright carrier (Beco Gemini) which works great but still doesn't cover/hold the baby the way the Moby did.She was really sick last night and the upright carrier just won't do for soothing her at 3am.  The Moby has been in the basement since every time I've tried it the baby just can't seem to get comfortable anymore and it's really not conducive to a quiet 3am soothing since I have to take my time to wrap it and inert her.My baby is still sick with the flu that's been going around this season and just can't seem to be consoled.  I sent my husband to the local store to buy a Maya wrap but it was sold out.  They had a single Slingeeze left.  I told him to bring it home b/c it's worth trying for the baby's comfort.Oh my goodness was that the right call!  It was hand in glove.  I slipped her right in, adjusted the top 'rail' and breastfed her then and there.  After which, she fell asleep  right away for 2 1/2 hours! Wow!! She hasn't fallen asleep in a carrier since the I last used the Moby 7 months ago.This is great and I'm so glad that we decided to try it out.The railing is a perfect 'pillow' for her head.  I tried my friend's sling wrap and I couldn't quite get it right but I was desperate (no sleep last night) and wanted to buy one anyway.  Thankfully, the Slingezee was available and is  just about foolproof (for me) in terms of finagling with excess cloth b/c it's just a pull on the 'tail(?)'.  Either way, it's made all set up and ready to go!May it be as good for you too!",5
Disney Pooh Musical Mobile Delightful Day,i loved this product its awesoe... the butterflys dont open like the picture shows but im working on them its still amazing! and matches the crib bedding perfect!,5
"Westwood Design Meadowdale Crib,Chestnut Brown","We purchased this crib 4 years ago from a Burlington coat factory. My husband and I decided to purchase this crib because it was much sturdier than anything else at the store, the design is beautiful, and it was given good reviews in the baby bargains book. It was also priced well for a convertible at less than $500.When we got it home we were pleasently suprised at how easy it was to put together and have contiued to love it when having to adjust the mattress depth at how simple it is. We have been using it now as a toddler bed for about 1.5 years with a universal wooden rail purchased from Babies r'us. Also the finish on this crib is great. Even after moving to a new home it has no knicks or scratches on it. I do have a Cocoon 1000 series crib for our other daugter and have been disappointed in the ability of the stain to withstand scratching. The Cocoon crib has also been more difficult to adjust the height settings without dismantling the whole crib.Be aware though when you go to purchase the convertible rails that they will take about 4 months to get. We purchased ours shortly after the birth of our daughter for fear that they would discontinue the product and we would not be able to get them at all. YOU WILL NEED TO PLAN AHEAD.We have not yet attached the adult conversion rails to the bed yet so I cannot make comments to the height.This is the only crib made in the Hart brand which is actually created by Westwood company. I would most certainly purchase another crib or furniture from the Westwood company and wish that we would have purchased one for our second child instead of a Cocoon crib. We did look extensively but at that time did not care for any of their other designs. Many of the company's other designs are very modern and not as detailed as the Meadowdale. Hopefully they will have more cribs in the future.",5
"JJ Cole Car Seat Cover, Khaki","Our little bundle of joy was only a couple months old when the cold weather started hitting and I needed something to help keep her warm. This works SO much better than blankets and couldn't be easier!! I stretched it over our Graco carseat in about 30 seconds and was ready to go. I've never had a problem with the zipper... has never snagged or been loud. The baby used to wake up very easily but as long as I did it slowly I could unzip it without stirring her at all. When she was little I could put the flap over her while going in and out which was really nice. Once she got to be about 4-5 months old though she would just push it off. Even so, it's still great because it provides warmth to the rest of her body and I can just drap a blanket over top when going in and out of places. I will say it does keep her nice and toasty so it definitely does it's job but this is also why I would unzip it when we got home so she wouldn't get too warm. I thought it was a great price, it's super easy to use, and keeps the baby warm which is what really matters! I think that by about 9 months this will start to get too small to zip all the way for most babies but I don't think they usually need it as much :)",5
Kushies 5 Pack Reusable Ultra Diapers for Infants,"These diapers are a lot of trouble when it comes laundry time. They have to be fastened inside out in order to really get them clean, it takes forever to get them dry at least an hour maybe more, and when they are dry you have to work them back into shape before using them again.  They are the least expensive AIO diaper, but I would definitely recommend paying more for a better diaper.",2
Lamaze Tug &amp; Play Activity Knot Take Along Toy,"I own the: moose, captain calamari, cube, giraffe, fish, porcupine. My firstborn was obsessed with the Lamaze toys. My secondborn child liked some parts of the Lamaze toys, but wasn't as capitated as the firstborn.So, I bought this Knot toy. The secondborn really likes it. Each item is easy for him to grasp, mouth, or teethe on. The teething and grasping ability  of the toy for an infant is really important to me because I'm slowly realizing that if my baby can't hold it, then he can't teethe on it or play with it (duh). This toy allows him to grab easily and bring it to his mouth.I highly recommend the Knot, Moose, Cpt Calamari.",5
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free High-Heat Resistant Classic Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology, 3-Pack","My first baby wouldn't take any bottle, ever.  It was breast feeding only or nothing.  So I wanted to try these with my second child (newborn) and am thrilled to report that he took the Born Free bottle.The bottle is easy to put together, with the active flow piece inserted into the bottle the cap and nipple are twisted on.  There was no leaking and I didn't notice any air getting into his mouth while he ate.I liked that the bottle was lightweight plastic that is BPA free.  I steamed them clean and as happy with the result.The package came with three bottles in it, which is perfect for me - I don't need any more than that.  They have bottle covers for traveling with the bottles, but I haven't used them yet.",5
Imse Vimse Water Shoes,"We have gotten a lot of miles out of these water shoes. I purchased size 12-18 months when my daughter was 14 months old and they were slightly big for her, but functional. She wore them for beach vacations during the winter and now almost every day during the summer. We keep them in our stroller and use them at playgrounds with water features and at pools and beaches. She can run in the the water and play on the equipment easily with these water shoes on. I plan to order the next size up for her.",5
"Edushape 4&quot; Sensory Balls, Set of 4, Solid","Besides the fact that the sensory balls arrived about 1/4 full of air (and that's being generous...3 out of four looked like someone spit inside them while manually blowing them up! The outside wasn't dirty, just the inside had a disgusting film on them. Waste of money, waste of time to return...ended up buying what I needed at BuyBuy Baby the next day for a better price. Don't buy from this vendor, they clearly don't care about product quality...any idiot would have noticed the beyond damaged merchandise when it was shipped. Normally I would file a complaint and go through the process to ship back and return...but being 37 weeks pregnant I don't have the time or energy to deal with it and chalk it up to getting screwed over and being disgusted. Least I could do is warn other parents...don't waste your time and money, buy somewhere else.",1

Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"My 7 week old son is a regurgitator and throws up if he's put flat on his back too soon after eating and/or without a very good burp. That said, he is congested quite frequently. Both of us hate the aspirator bulb as I can't tell if it's working so I just keep at it. Maybe it's a gross mom thing, but I LOVE being able to SEE what's coming out of his nose so I know whether or not &#34;I got it&#34; lol...I think this is by far the best little known baby product I've purchased. I use it at least once a day and when I use it with saline drops, I'm able to clean his nose in under 30 seconds...with the aspirator bulb it takes me that long to keep him from moving his head. He cries, but stops immediately when his nose is clear! It's a must-have for any nursery. I'm getting a 2nd for my diaper bag!!!",5
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium","My son loves SwaddleMe products! He's a little more than a month old and he's been using them for 3-4 weeks now. I bought this for him because it was going to be cooler where we live. It's not too heavy but keeps him nice and warm. SwaddleMe is soft and cozy. All of the SwaddleMe Products help him sleep easier and I will admit that they've 100% helped me and my husband sleep at night. Once he's in his ""baby straight jacket"" he sleeps at least 4 hours a night, sometimes up to 6! So easy to use too! There is a video a person made on youtube if you have no idea how to put it on baby. Great investment!",5
Dragonfly Mobile Decoration for Baby Nursery Ceiling Wall Room Decorations Outdoor Home Decorations,"I ordered this mobile to hang over my daughter's changing table. When it arrived, the dragonflies were much bigger than I thought they were. (I didn't really review the product details before ordering. I just went by the pictures but realize now that none of them really had other objects next to the mobile to give it some scale.)But I hung it anyway and now really love it. I was worried that being so big it would draw too much focus to that part of the room but they're so light and airy they add a nice touch without dominating the changing station. And my daughter loves staring up at them.Glad I got them and glad they were bigger than I expected.",5
"Tadpoles 0-6 Months Embroidered Sleep Sack, Monkey ABCs","I love this sleep sack it is soooooo soft and cuddly and the embroidery is an extra special touch. However, I'm worried to put and infant in this as the head opening could fit a whole entire baby through it. Same goes for the arm holes~it's just really really big more so for an older child I would think. Picture doesn't show it but the zipper actually starts up by the right armpit hole and zips all the way down and around making for easy quick diaper changes.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I think most of the people overrated Sophie. My son shows no interest in this teetering at all. He actually likes to grab it and bang it. And the price is wayyyyyyyy too expensive. i wont recommend it.,3
Cloud b Sleep Sheep On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds,"We are HUGE fans of the Sleep Sheep and recommend it and buy it as a baby gift often.  We like the selection of sounds and the ability to control the volume and select from two different run-times.  The velcro strap and size make it handy to take with you on car trips or to use when away from home.  When we wanted to wean our kids off of white noise, we lowered the volume each day a little more until they just didn't need it anymore.  But, we've had quality issues with all three that we've had.  Bought the first one on amazon for the first baby.  It worked well with daily use for a year then just crapped out.  I probably wouldn't have considered that a problem b/c it did get A LOT of use and we easily got our money's worth.  It wasn't used as a toy and although we did travel with it, it didn't really get beat up.  Bought a second one from Toys R Us for the second baby a few years later and that one stopped working at 10 minutes every time, no matter what length of time it was set for.  Returned it to the store and the replacement always stops at 20 minutes even when set for the longer time.  Kept it anyway b/c it's just hard to keep getting back to a store with a newborn and we needed it and it worked well enough to make do.I definitely still recommend this if your baby is a white noise kind of kiddo, but make sure you check the return policy from the vendor just in case.",4

"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink","I purchased this product based on an article I saw in a Parenting magazine saying it was the only thermal jar to pass some test for keeping food warm at a safe temperature for 5 hrs.  BULL!  After 2 hrs, you can expect food that was piping hot when placed in the thermos to be lukewarm, at best.  It's nice to have in terms of storage (doesn't leak), but it surely doesn't keep food all that warm.  At least not mac n cheese.  Maybe soup will stay warmer.  Haven't tried that yet.  I give it a 3.",3
"Boon Animal Bag Stuffed Animal Storage, Blue Raspberry","My boys have had this storage pod for years now and love it.

"Nurtria Regular Neck Bottles with Organizer, Blue, 6-Count","Why is it so hard to find a Bottle Caddy? This one is so cute! My 8-month old nephew loves his Medela bottles, so I really only needed the caddy. It's a little tight but it does the trick. I can pack all of his bottles for daycare/babysitter/long trip. It's so compact and fits neatly in the fridge or a cooler. Highly recommended!",5
Disney Cars Bath Tub Mat,"I wanted a fun bath tub mat for my daughter so I got her this. I love the look of it and it does its job. I only have two minor complaints. First, it is not as big as I was expecting it to be. It is a little short for our standard size tub and not quite wide enough either. It's not a huge deal b/c she is supervised but still cause for concern. My other issue with this is that you have to pull it up after every bath/shower b/c water does get underneath it and if you don't let it air out, it can get mildewy etc. Probably best for an older child who doesn't need quite so much supervision and a patient parent who doesn't mind putting it down before every use. And pulling it back up.",3

Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"The foam was in brand new condition but the tape that is ""suppose to"" fasten it to any surface is a waste of money. After having it on our coffee table (which is glass) for only a week, the tape lost it's tackiness and the foam started falling off. I had to secure the foam to the table with packaging tape, which now looks even worse than the foam alone. When shopping for this product, please choose a different brand.",2

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Rainforest","I bought this for when we visit the grandparents or friends' homes. It works great, keeps him entertained for a short while and works as a makeshift high chair. I originally thought I would use this in restaurants as well, but it's a little bulky to tote around with everything else like diaper bag, etc. even when you fold it up. I'd rather just stick a cover on the restaurant high chair and call it a day.",5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"We have two other monitors but we left them behind when we were visiting New York. So, we thought this was sort of mid range in price and it's Sony so it's probably good. We were wrong. It works but only a few feet outside the door of our kids room. Every time you pass the monitor it makes a loud static noise. We've tried to change the frequency but it didn't help. It's not attractive either. We're surprised Sony makes it. Spend 10 to 20 bucks more on something better.",2

Sesame Street Adjustable Juice Box Holder,"I just received this SS juice box holder a few weeks ago and already wonder what I ever did without it.  Wait, I remember, I changed a lot of juice soaked/stained shirts.  The inner compartment lifts out for easy placement of your juice box or bag - it accommodates either.  I've tried both short and tall juice boxes and they all work fine, the inner compartment raises and lowers to fit all boxes that I've used with no squishing.  The back of the holder has a place for you to put your child's name (i.e. This box belongs to) and it's dishwasher safe; a must in my busy house.  The housing is strong and solid, and the handles make it so easy for my 24 month old to carry around, drink out of, etc.  It is a little on the bulky side, but well worth the space that it takes up in my diaper bag.  I'll be ordering more for gifts soon!",5
"phil&amp;teds Lobster Highchair, Red","We originally purchased the Inglesina Fast Chair but I was frustrated with the fact that it had no tray and there was a gap between the chair and table. After having multiple gel mats flung to the floor and food shoved into the gap and onto the floor I purchased the lobster chair. I have used it for three days (we use it in lieu of a stand alone high chair) and am satisfied with how easily it attached and the tray. No more dents in my table from slammed bottles and no more flying mats. Hooray! Several people complained how easily the tray slides out. I have not found this to be a problem. In the future if little one decides shoving it forward is fun I will slip a piece of non-slip matting under the tray. The bucket seat is a little deep in order to accompany kids of all sizes. My little one is on the small size so I folded a towel and put it in the seat to boost him up a bit. Eventually I will not need the towel. Over all I am satisfied with this chair. It packs up compactly, is easier and less bulky than the Inglesina, has a tray and sits little one closer to the table. Win, win.",5
Biddy Belly,"I brought the Biddy Buddy for my three month old and it worked. My infant went from not crying everytime we did tummy to rolling over herself and staying on her stomach with a smile. If anything i would say upgrade the little dangling toy objects, they are cheaply made but its also a plus bc i just replace the cheap side toys with my own toy selection. All and all a great developmental toy for my bundle of joy.",4
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"We previously used a video monitor system that claimed to have ""no interference"" however, living in a heavily populated area with tons of electronic devices you can say we had some issues; Snaps, crackles and pops every night and nonstop at that. This could not last as out sleep was suffering.Doing a little research we happened upon this item. The DACT filtering really works and works well. All you get is the noise of your wee one. In fact, with the sensitivity settings, you can even set it so you only get it when the little one is at a sound level you want to hear! These means I don't have to hear the general non stop chatter that ours does just before he completely crashes. Instead I have ours set so that I'll hear him just before he gets worked up. What this means is more sleep for me! And, in fact, more sleep for him as I'm not trying to wake him up prematurely.The other great benefit is that the device acts as a two way radio. This is great as if my spouse is feeding the little master, we can still converse from the other room (and vice versa on that). This is amazingly handy - and a great feature. It is advertised as a way to sooth your child and while I'm not sure about that (that's not really my style) I can say its a great way to talk without yelling to one another.Overall setup was a breeze. Thankfully these are both plug and battery operated. The general quality feels like a good piece of plastic. It should easily last a few years. And it can take a fall.Did I mention that it's whisper quiet! If you are looking for a quiet baby monitor and you have a ton of electronic devices around, this is the monitor to get. Bar None.",5
"GroVia Cloth Wipes, 12 count","We have been using the GroVia line of diapers since our daughter was born two months ago.  We had found some wipes at a local shop that we love, but they where home made and did not have information on where to buy more.  After looking around on the internet, we decided to go with these wipes and I think we made the right choice.The wipes are the size of our house wash cloths.  They do seem to be made of a material that needs to be washed a handful of times to get maximum absorbency if you use water to wet the cloths before use.  (This is normal on most cotton diaper products.)  The wipes are very soft on one side and a little more scratchy on the other which is handy for the messier changes.I think that whenever we need to buy more wipes, this will be the brand we go with.",5
Lambs &amp; Ivy Dream Teddy Wallpaper Border 8''x30'',"As a  first time user of borders & wallpaper, this is not a one person task.  Instuctions OK, but because they don't tell you it is best to get a second person following the instructions maybe difficult.  When the border is wet for the ten second and applied to the wall, it is too loose and has a tendency to slide.  Because the border expands when wet, you want to do one complete section.  This does not work for a loner.  It's best to just get help.",4

"Re-Play 3 Count Bowls, Pink, Green, Orange","Really, these bowls are awesome.  They are thick and heavy.  The size and shape is great for toddlers.  I love that they're made from recycled materials.  The ONLY negative things I have to say is that I wish they could go in the microwave and I wish they could go on the bottom row of the dishwasher.  However, I knew both those negatives before I bought them and I wouldn't take back the decision.  Good buy.  Worth it.  Go for it.",4
"Delta Children's Products Silverton Sleigh 4 in 1 Crib, Dark Cherry","If you organize the parts before you start, it's not too tough to assemble. I had the biggest challenge installing the mattress support, but was tight on space.

"ERGObaby Wrap, Eucalyptus","Babywearing is a HUGE interest of mine (I am a VBE of a local babywearing group), so I jumped at the chance to try out ERGObaby's new wrap.  I started my wrapping days with a stretchy wrap, and I've tried a wide variety of wraps with my three children.  Unlike other popular stretchy wraps, the ERGObaby wrap WILL work with a heavier baby, and even on your back.  More on that later.The ERGObaby comes in a few color choices, and includes a pocket.  As for most baby carrier ""pockets"" I've tried, you can't really stuff a bunch of things inside, or anything especially bulky or poky, but it's a nice little add on for small things.  It also helps you collapse the ERGObaby wrap when it's not being worn.  I really liked the color of the Eucalyptus and Pepper wraps and found them both a good gender neutral color.  Inside is an instruction manual with one type of front carry.  I appreciate that ERGObaby doesn't intimidate the newer babywearer that might pick one of these up with lots of instructions.  Their webpage has a few more instructions, and, like I mentioned above, unlike other popular stretchy wraps, since the ERGObaby wrap is a *hybrid*, it is safe for back carries*.  I personally liked the double hammock (DH) carry.I tried the wrap out with my 5 year old and my friend's 6 month old daughter.  It was okay with my daughter (she's very leggy even if she's not very heavy), but it definitely worked well for my friend's daughter.  The nice thing about the hybrid wrap is that it's stretchy without being too stretchy or saggy.  My friend, anxious to try out the wrap, used it on her 4 year old son in a DH and really enjoyed the way it wrapped.  She even borrowed the wrap and used it for hours with her youngest, and she said that even with a sloppy pocket wrap cross carry, it was comfortable the whole time.It is a bit more expensive than some other stretchy wraps, but it's worth every penny.  Most stretchy wraps sag too much when your baby gets bigger, but the ERGObaby wrap doesn't!  It's also cheaper than most woven wraps, and can do many of the carries that woven wraps offer.  It is definitely a great baby shower present!  I wish the wraps came in other colors and patterns, but it's a very small complaint for such a great carrier.  The other small complaint some might have is that the fabric isn't going to be especially breathable (though it's definitely better than some other carriers), though no multi-layer carrier is going to really be cool when you're wrapping it around yourself and a warm baby.  The other huge drawback for some is that wraps have a large learning curve and the amount of fabric can be intimidating to some, though it's usually an obstacle that can be overcome with practice.*Please be cautious when learning how to back wrap.  I personally recommend attending a local babywearing group if you can, but if you can't, there are great videos online to help teach you how to back wrap.  You might want to practice over a bed or a soft couch and/or with a spotter to help ensure your child's safety, or practice with a stuffed animal or pillow.  Unless an experienced wrapper, I would not recommend back wrapping with a newborn.",5

Just one note on the ""Uptown Stripe"" print - the edges are brown (I'd thought they were black).",5
Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,"This was great to transition my daughter to sleeping without waking up scared all the time, it was light enough that it comforted her until she went to sleep and stayed lit long enough to make her feel secure. The bad part was that it quit working after 6 months but I will say it was well worth it to get the extra sleep!",4

"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","I first bought these when I again had to replace the 12 pacifiers that had gone missing. My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors likeGumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Packand Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green) for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures, like this oneWubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Cutsie Caterpillar.  TheWubbaNub Tabby Kittenis my daughter's favorite. I have noticed that it is aslightly smaller than the others but she still grabs that one if given the option.  (And we all know that little babies have big personalities.) The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear.  Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump.  They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket.  I have bought many for my friends.  When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",5
"No-Spill Cup w/ Soft Spout &amp; Handles, Neutral Colors",I bought 2 Nuby sippy cups hoping that they would work and at least not leak. The fact that it was easy to suck the drink out was the only reason it got any stars at all. The lid and ring do not fit properly. The silicon nipple part gaps up under the ring and eventually pops out causing leakage. Pretty pointless if you ask me. I am very disappointed in this product as I had high hopes for it.,2
"Graco ComfortSport Convertible Car Seat, Zara","We purchased the Graco ComfortSport at Target in Sept of 2010 as an emergency replacement for our previous carseat after an accident. (We actually got the Creighton model.) I have 3 major concerns about the safety of this seat:1) The shoulder straps do not tighten evenly. After looking at the back of the seat I realized this is due to the design of the set yoke; most seats have two individual hooks for the shoulder belts, tightened by a single pull strap. The ComfortSport overlaps the two shoulder straps under a single hook and one strap will always be a little looser than the other. This also crates the potential for the overlapping strap to slip out of the hook, as it is barely held in place by the hook.2) The chest plate is easy to unbuckle, even for young children. I looked up advice on how to solve this issue on Graco's website- apparently many parents were having the same issues and Graco's response was that parents should just explain to their children why they need to keep the belt on. After pulling over 10+ times on a two-hour trip because my 2 year old didn't understand my explaining on why this belt was intended to keep him safe, I settled on buying self-adhesive Ace wrap to wrap around the buckle so he couldn't mess with it.3) The tightening plate on our model broke after only 11 months of use. I was tightening the strap, as usuall, and the single screw the holds the plate in place pulled out and flew somewhere in the car. If this had happened during an accident, the shoulder straps would have been loosened about 2 inches and greatly reduced the protection of the seat.I had contaceted Graco regauding my concerns about the seat, and asking for a refund. They sent me a letter stating that if I had problems with their product, I should ship it to them at MY expense and they would replace the seat with another one of the same model- no refund. Needless to say I just went out and bought a different, better rated seat for my son.",2
Changing Table Pad - size: 17x34,"I really liked this pad.  The one that came with the changing table ripped just by getting my very short, non manicured, figure nails caught on the pad while picking the baby up.  This quilted version has been far more resilient to tears and looks prettier too.  Well worth the money.",5
Xpress Trainer Pro-All In One-Real Simple Potty Training Round/Standard Family Toilet Seat,"I purchased this seat for my two year old daughter, because she insisted on dumping the little one all by herself. I'm sure you can imagine the mess involved! Now with the help of a step stool she uses the ""big girl potty"" all by herself. I love it. The easy removal feature is great as well, it makes cleaning a breeze! I only gave it 4 stars because if she didn't sit back far enough she peed on the floor. It took her about a week to figure this out! It's a great seat! Well worth every penney!",4
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub,"This is the best baby tub ever! I've been using this for my son since he was a few weeks old. It comes with an insert to help keep your baby upright and in place. You can decide how much you want your little one submerged in the water simply by how much you fill the tub. There is also a built in drain for you to let out water without having to take your baby out. My son loves to lay on his back and kick his legs freely in the water - He's almost 3 months now and is still using the insert, but as soon as he can sit up on his own, I'll take the insert out. I love the cute little whale cup it comes with - its perfect for rinsing his hair.Bath time has become my son's favorite because of this little tub! I plan on using this until he grows out of it. The quality and price just can't be beat. And the convenience of not having to clean my tub everytime I want to bathe my son is great! This little tub is perfect and I highly recommend it!",5
"Maison Chic Jersey Blankie, Dog","I started using this ""lovey"" with my daughter when she turned 4 months old (she is now 8 months).  She had horrible sleep initiation issues and was not one to take a pacifier, so at the suggestion of the book, ""The No Cry Sleep Solution,"" a lovey became one of the tools I used in my bag of tricks for getting my little one to sleep.  She immediately took to her bunny and has used it for every nap and bedtime since.  Because she sucks on the arms to fall asleep, I have to wash her lovies quite often (she has two identical ones- they get alternated based on which one is cleaner).  Despite many washing and runs through the dryer, they have held up.  I just ordered two more though since I don't know how many (almost) daily washing they can take without eventually falling apart and I don't want to be stuck without her lovey!I choose this one over the more plush ones I found because it seemed like less of a suffocation risk.  That's not to say that early on I didn't frequently remove it from her face as she fell asleep with it.  Now that she's older, she doesn't put it over her head anymore and if she does, she easily removes it herself.",5

Long-Range Vibrating Baby Monitor,"We have had this monitor for almost three years now.  We used it for about 1 1/2 years and then put it away until our third child came along.  The monitor doesn't hold its charge, and we cannot hear anything unless the volume dial is turned up high.  It also emits crackling and static when the dial is touched.  We probably will have to buy another monitor because it drives me crazy every time I try to adjust it.",2
Cybex Aton Infant Car Seat (2013) - Heavenly Blue,Best car seat this is our 5th Cybex wouldn't buy any other brand! Plus I love all the colors.  People always stop and ask me where I purchased it.  It is really unique looking and one of the lightest and well made on the market.  Mine fits into my bugaboo stroller with the maxi cosi stroller adapter.  It's a nice combo it sits up really high unlike most strollers and since my husband and I are tall it's a back saver.,5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue",I loved the idea behind this but you really only want to use this when they are small and the size small was still to big for my son to be swaddled tightly enough to create the comfort he needed. He was 7lb6oz (which isn't even that small). They should really make a preemie size or make the small a little smaller.,3

Safety 1st 900 Mhz Sight And Sound Nursery Monitor System,"We have this monitor and I could not live without it. I cant imagine not being able to see my daughter at night if I hear her making noise. The camera works great and the picture is clear. I have noticed that if I move the camera to certain areas of the crib the reception will suffer so you have to get the camera in just the right spot. The handheld unit works great throughout the house (3600sqft)although it doesnt work if I go out in the driveway, I bought a cheap $20 one that takes care of that. This product has worked great for us!",4

"Dream On Me Ashton 4 in 1 Convertible Crib, Cherry","After my first born, I was trying to buy something a little more affordable the second time around when I came across this crib. Not only is it at a decent price, it also is very beautiful, and easy to assemble. Although, the pieces were not marked, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how to put this crib together. The picture diagram is pretty self explanatory. The cherry color crib was right on mark when it came to color and its wood is very beautiful and has a very clean form. When purchasing the crib, I decided to also buy the mattress and waterproof mattress cover recommended by Amazon which I got all at a great price and everything fit perfectly together. I received 2 of the 3 packages on the same day and the last package a week later, but always before the original shipping date. I was very satisfied with my crib choice and can't wait to use it for my baby!",4

At first they were a little small so I wrapped a blanket in the seat to keep them snug and put a pillow in the base so their feet had something to rest on.

That and the clear roller were their favorites.Easy to put togetherDurable PlasticThe toys are removeable for easy cleaning/washing and some can be switched around.The seat cover was secure but easy enough to removed to wash.Seat spins easliy.Easy height adjustmentThe only things I noticed:Rocks without the foot pegs. Didn't come with. I used a rolled up towel to stabilize it. I guess I could have called the manufacturer to get them like others have.Hard to wipe clean with all the toys attached. Luckily the toys easily detach to resolve this but would have like it better if I could give a quick wipe down without having to dismantle it.Big footprint.

Vulli Chan Pie Gnon Natural Rubber Teether - Blue Chan,"I bought this for my son after we lost Sophie since he's less expensive. My son enjoys teething on him but seems to have liked Sophie better. It's still great that this is made from natural rubber and food-based paint and don't have to worry about him chewing on it. It's really cute, too.",4
Evenflo Comfort Select Manual Breast Pump,"My old Avent Isis that my sister loaned to me broke, so I went out looking for a replacement.  I selected this Evenflo pump, because it seemed to look the most like the Isis.  Apparently, all pumps are NOT created equal.  When I used to pump with the Isis, my milk came out so easily, quickly, and with no discomfort.  With this one, after about 20 minutes I had only one ounce out of each, my hand was so tired, and I was sore.  Didn't seem to matter which setting I had it on, or whether I had the horn insert in or not.  It also recommended hand expressing to begin with, before I began pumping...but didn't really think that was practical, since most of the time I will be using this in public bathrooms, while my little one is at home with Dad.  I went online and spent the extra $ to order a new Avent Isis.",2
Guidecraft Tan Storage Bins (Set of 5),"I was a little disappointed at the tiny size of these baskets.They're not suitable for bookshelf, big plush toys and so on.So I use them for storing baby's clothes in a dresser.It works better as divisions for separating clothes, socks.",4
"Sunshine Kids Radian80Sl Convertible Car Seat, Shadow","We love our Radian carseats!  We bought this one for our son, after getting one for our daughter and falling in love with it.  They are narrow and we can sit them side by side in the car so that when he fusses (8 months), she will hold his hand for us, give him his paci back, and sing him songs.  Such a lifesaver!!",5
Avent Easy Breast Milk Containers - Set of 4,"the easy bresast milk cointainer are really helpfull, I'm in love because it preserves the milk really well. milk directly to the bottle!",5
Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper,"This fits our table well, it's a little loose around the sides, but very secure in the corners. It has saved our little girl from getting a few head bumps and she can't take it all off like she could with just corner protectors so I would recommend it.",4
Sweet Jojo Designs Baby and Kids Clothes Laundry Hamper - Pink and Brown Modern Polka Dots,"I ordered this hamper with the hopes that it would somewhat go with my Pottery Barn nursery set, and was pleasantly surprised.(The Sophie set- polka dots) Its not an exact match, but it does the trick! These hampers aren't the most sturdy, but they definitely get the job done, and I would order from them again!.",4
"Pickles Nummy Animal Snuggly Banky, Pink Bunny, 16 X 16&quot;",I am so glad I found this because my son & daughter each have their own and carry them all over the place. Unfortunately my son lost his so I was so happy when I found one that matched his & I found this one to match my daughter's just in case she accidentally misplaces hers.,5
Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer,"This is a great purchase from an experienced mom!  I have used many potty seats in the past, but this one just makes sense.  It is so easy to clean and move on and off.  We have an elongated seat that none of the cheaper seat covers would fit. I started my daughter on the big potty (my little experiment) and she is doing great with this seat!  Highly recommend this seat for both boys and girls!Mom from AZ",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I bought this for us to be able to hear my daughter when we went outside for a smoke break. It worked at first, but when we moved her to her own room it stopped working. Not going to buy this monitor again.",1
"Summer Infant Character Change Pad Cover, Butterfly Ladybug",This was a great purchase!  It fits the changing pad perfectly.  It is so soft and it washes great.  I just bought another one!,5
Earlyears Roll n Swirl Ball Ramp,"Bought this for a one year old and her three year old sister LOVED it! I am hoping the younger one will show interest in it one day. For now, the big sister is having a ball with it!",5
"ERGObaby Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Natural",This insert worked perfectly for my first baby and we used it almost daily for walks or even to be close while doing chores around the house. It washes and dries well - holds it s shape. The only complaint I have is that I could never figure out how to make the adjustable closure stay synched after I snapped it in place.,5

Parents Units Super Stopper for Windows and Doors,"I really wanted this to work. Five minutes after I put these on the window my 10 month old climbed up on our ground level window sills and pulled them right off. I left two on a high window for a couple of days until my mother (who didn't realize they were there) opened the window right up with very little resistance, leaving the stoppers in place. We're still trying to find a solution that doesn't involve bars.",1
"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch",This monitor works seamlessly right out of the box. Great viewing angles and visuals are clear in both daylight and at night. I have no complaints thus far.- M. Salzman,5
"American Baby Company Organic Embroidered Receiving Blanket, Mocha","I'm so surprised that someone thought this blanket was rough. How is that possible? The fabric is super soft - almost buttery! I love how it's stretchy and drapes so well. It just hangs down and stays where you put it. The sewn on teddy bear is not scratchy at all. The blanket is on the small side, a good size for swaddling a newborn. Now that my little one is older, I keep it in the diaper bag as an all purpose blanket, cover, etc. Because the fabric is so stretchy and drapes so well, it stays compact in the diaper bag. Highly recommended (unless you don't buy items from China).",5
"Britax B-Agile Fashion Stroller Kit, Cowmooflage","great product, makes  the stroller more comfy and breaks the solid color of the b agile stroller. easy to take off and wash, no re threading needed.",5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll",Completely happy with the product. It keeps baby busy. Easy to attach it to the stroller and carseat. I even attached it to playmat.I would recommended it.,5
Tot Lok Deluxe Set PLUS One Spare Magnetic Key,our cabinets are a little thicker than normal so you have to really hit the spot to get these to open but we've gotten used to it.  I also added a rare earth magent to the end of it from a hard drive I took apart.  The stronger magnet makes it much easier to use.I love the design in that my kids can't get in.  That is the main point but we also have to be able to get in so that's why I went with 4 stars rather than 5.,4
"The First Years Indigo Stroller, Red","The Indigo stroller is lovely to look at, and everywhere I took it it got a lot of attention. Its features are great: it has a high, Euro-style seat, and the reversible seat is a terrific concept, and hard to find at a reasonable price. However, I sent the stroller back after one month of use. The wheels began to squeak on our first walk. No amount of grease would stop the squeaking, and it became so loud it drew stares from across the street. Then, after three weeks of use, the front wheels began to lock up so severely that the stroller would suddenly come to a stop and pitch forward. The seam on the parent console, which is made of cloth, ripped, rendering it useless and ugly. The Indigo collapses in two parts; the seat must be detached from the unit in order to fold it down, making it hard to collapse swiftly, and bulky in the car. The other flaw in the Indigo is its low head clearance. My average-height two-year-old bumped his head on the the canopy. I was willing to overlook this drawback because I planned to use the stroller more for my infant, but the wheels were a deal-breaker.",1
"NUK Toddler Tooth and Gum Cleanser, 1.4 Ounce, (Colors May Vary)","Our 18 month old mimics his older brother and brushes his teeth alongside him, and this brush is the perfect shape and size for his little hands!",5
"RayShade&reg; UV Protective Stroller Shade Improves Sun Protection for Strollers, Joggers and Prams Black","This shade work great on my jogger stroller, keeps my son well shaded, it covers almost double what the stroller shade did. I didn't give it a 5 star because it doesn't work with umbrella strollers, the straps are spaced to far apart and you can't get it tight enough. Also it says you can fold it into itself like a pocket, but doesn't give instructions and neither my husband or I could figure out how to do it.",4
Nuby 2-Pack 8 oz No Spill Cup with Super Spout (Color may vary),"I wish I could give this zero stars. The handles get in the way so it's hard to screw the lid on. The threads on the lid and base almost never line up properly, making it leak constantly. I get my hands all covered in apple juice just trying to get the thing set so my toddler can drink.",1
Fisher-Price: Link-a-doos Open-Top Take-Along Swing,"My son screamed whenever we put him in the swing from birth to 2-3 months.  Now at 4 months, he will tolerate it, but only for short periods of time.  Some friends lent us their full size Graco swing and he loves that one!My biggest complaint is that the seat isn't supportive and too reclined.  My son is much happier in the molded plastic seat with padding so he can sit up straight and see what's going on.  Also, the mechanism that makes it swing gets knocked off easily when the swing is moved from place to place and it will just stop swinging.We're all much happier with the full size swing.",2
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Freeflow Pacifier, 6-18 Months,  Colors and Designs May Vary, 2-Count",Very cute! Gender neutral and easy to locate in the dark - as opposed to the clear ones. This is baby's favorite pacifier.,5
"JL Childress 6 Bottle Cooler, Black",It didn't fit 6 bottles. I went on a trip and it only fit 3 bottles and they were tall and skinny. It also didn't keep my stuff cold. I wouldn't buy it again.,3

"My Brest Friend Twins Plus Deluxe Nursing Pillow, Green, 0-12 Months","I bought this based on the reviews and have tried to use it multiple times in the 4+ months I've been feeding twins.  I'm not tiny (size 12), but can't get it tight enough so there ends up being a large gap in front.  I can't get it to sit high enough so I end up hunched over.  I also can't figure out the ""back support"".  It is awful in every situation.  Doesn't even double as something else I can use for them.The Twin Z nursing pillow is better (still not perfect - had to add snaps on latch system because buckles don't get it tight enough, have to use pillow under because it isn't tall enough, and it is getting flatter).  But it is muli-purpose and more comfortable.Wish I'd spent the money I spent on this on something else.",2
"babyletto Madison Swivel Glider, Mocha","I bought this because I never put my feet up, even when nursing, and I didn't want one of the traditional gliders for my daughter's room.  This is much more stylish looking, and I can use it in other parts of the house since it actually looks nice.  I love that it can swivel all around.  We read books in it too.  I use a small pillow at the base of my back to make it a little more comfortable.",5
KinderGlo Owl Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light,My daughtER loves this night light. It's the perfect size and gives off just the right amount of light from her room. I didn't give it a 5 for 2 reasons 1:the charger is temperamental. The night light has to be sitting just right on it for it to charge. 2: you can not have it on the charger and have it on all night long. As soon as you put it on the charger it triggers the 30 min timer. It does stay on all night without staying on the charger tho so this isn't a big deal to me.,4
"Keekaroo Height Right Kids High Chair, Natural","Attention: This chair is not what is listed in the description (6 months and up). There are two Keekaroo chairs sold by Amazon that are exactly the same except this one doesn't come with a tray and you cannot buy the tray separately. I was quickly price shopping and didn't realize that this chair does not come with the tray. Because the tray is not sold separately, I need to ship the whole box back and exchange for the chair with the tray to make it useful for a 6 month old.The chair is really nice though, which is why I'll go through the hassle of the exchange. It's solid and very well made. It is the 'right height' to scoot up to the dining room table once your child id old enough to sit at the table without a tray. If you're looking for a high chair to put in the kitchen however, and feed your baby while standing up, this isn't the right chair for you because it won't be tall enough.",4
"Ultimate Silicone Teething Feeder - Safe for your Infant - Allow Baby to Self Feed Fresh or Frozen Fruit and Other Food While Massaging His or Her Gums - Soothe the Pain of Teething - Easy to Clean Silicone Sac- Money Back Guarantee, Large, Light Blue/Dark Blue",This is the best design out there.

Jolly Jumper Snuggle Cover for Soft Baby Carriers - Black,I highly recommend this item. I use it with the Ergo carrier. I love how easy it is to slip on over my head. It covers her well. Perfect for rain or snow. Love that I don't always have to put her in a bulky snowsuit.,5
"Dream On Me Karley Bassinet, Pink",Because it's everything that I wanted for her it keep her worm it can keep the bus away and it so adorable.I just love it it's so cute and pretty thank so much.,5
"Britax Monarch Booster Car Seat, Royal Racer","We really like this carseat.  I kept my daughter in a 5 point harness as long as I could, but was finally ready for the transition.  I like the fact it can be one unit or just the bottom.  She really likes the side head rests- she had them on her older Britax carseat as well.  Like many of the other posts have said-  I agree the cupholders are useless.  It's to bad they couldn't come up with a more clever design for the cupholders or even add a personal reading light.  Many other carseats offer more of these ""extras"", but I can't give up the safety of the Britax.  I do wish, that it would have come with the Latch system though.  I really like the security of knowing that the seat isn't going anywhere.",4
Boon Flair Harness/Buckle,"This is a great buckle for your child especially if he's a big boy. Either way, its a lot better than any standard one.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",Works as advertised.  Probably not best choice if you will be putting up and taking down often but still not difficult. Walk through cate is good idea and latch is secure.,4
'Medela 21mm Personalfit Breastshield 2-pack (Non-retail Packaging),"I bought these to use with my Medela pump when the standard size that is included didn't work well for me. If you have large breasts, don't think that you need a larger size. I have DD breasts, and going down in size is the only way I could pump effectively.",5
"Safety 1st Travel Ease Deluxe Playard, Marina",I got this one for the pattern bc I plan on having another one and it goes both ways.  The changing table part of it is a bit difficult bc it kinda leans or tilts sideways but I never used it anyways so it didn't bother me but if u plan on using it just be aware of that. It's useable and u will get used tout but it does tilt a bit,5
"The First Years Soft Grip Trainer Seat, Blue",i have owned other potty seats... and training toilets...tjis one is one piece molded plastic...easy to clean  and store...it does the job great of makingthe big potty fit a little child...great buy,5
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"My little one has never been interested in tummy time.  I purchased this in hopes of making it a little more exciting for him and it worked!  He loves looking at himself in the mirror or listening to the crinkle of the leaves or wings when his hands move over them.  I know he's not meaning to just yet, but he's been able to move himself around and has been able to enjoy all the sections of this gym.I would highly recommend it for babies who are less than happy with tummy time!",5
"My Brest Friend Angled Feeding Pillow, Green","This works so well. Way better than any traditional pillow shape. It cuts down on spit up, and help with easier burping. I also don't feel so hunched over As I did with traditional pillows. The cover is very soft. I would say it's almost too soft because my baby has a tendency to slide down it.",5
"PBnJ baby Paci Holder, Big Pink/Purple Dots",My husband loves this things. They do get the job done. However i get tired of them getting tangled with things.... I guess it is a matter of preference :),3
Dreambaby Cable Lock,"I am a kid-proofing pro, as I have an autistic 17 year old boy in the house.  Problem is, typical kid-proofing pieces are all plastic and he can just rip those babies off.  My refrigerator is a constant problem, and I searched a long time.  Bicycle cable locks are way too long, and although I found a keyed padlock with a hasp just long enough to go over the french door handles, I was terrified of losing the key.  This combo cable is adjustable and strong, and no key to lose.  I can change the combination if ever I need to as well!",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Premium Nurser Bottle, 4 Ounce (Colors and packaging may vary)","We really like these bottles. Our daughter was having major gas issues and these bottles have helped. You can warm them. I press out the air and then put in a cup of hot water to warm. Or, I put the bottle in the microwave (no cap, just the bottle and liner) for about 15-20 seconds and it works great. The system is not perfect (have to buy liners, not a lot of room if you are making 4 oz of formula if you are mixing in the bottle) but it's still very good. One less thing to wash is a plus too.",4
Safety 1st Sleepy Baby Nail Clipper,"Not only is the light on these clippers a life saver, they clip better than any others I've tried.  My twins scratch themselves up if I don't keep on top of their nails and this has helped me do so more than anything else I have tried.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I'm not sure about this one.  In concept, it's a fabulous idea.  I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.  I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.  The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.  In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.  My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor...I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.  If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.",3
"Soft Gear My Booster Seat, Mint","We bought this for my just-turned 3 year old and every mealtime we have to kick her siblings (5 and 7) out of it. It's very comfortable and wipes clean. We have wooden chairs with a bit of contour to them. I kneel in the booster to get a tight seal...you don't have to, it will still stay put when they're climbing in and out, but it's really secure if you do. It's easy to throw in the car to take to grandma's and no straps to deal with or get food on! Wish we had this years ago.",5
Chicco Cortina Stroller Explorer,"I bought this stroller for $129.00 and receieved it today. It was pretty easy to put together. This is my 4th stroller in 14 months (yes I am very picky) and this one by far is the best! I have owned a Britax Forerunner stroller, Fisher-Price Infant to Toddler stroller and an Inglesina Espresso Stroller and now a Chicco Cortina!Pros:Large Storage BasketChild trayParent TrayEasy to open and close/foldWindow that you can actually see your child through!Well-made and designedSmooth rideBig but not too wide or bulkyComfortable/padded seatStands by itself when in folded positionAnd many extra little featuresCons:HeavyNot very compactManual does not state how to use the multi-position canopy to were is moves completely forward as pictured and stated on boxGreat buy, the very best by far!!!",5

Hard Rock Cloth Diaper &amp; Laundry Detergent - Motley Clean,Jus did not get our diapers clean. They always felt like there was a lot of residue left over. Not for us I like our diapers clean.,1
"Kushies 6 Pack Wash Cloth Set, White","These are very small!  I know I'm washing a baby, but these are so small they are hard to hold onto.  They also curl up when you wash them making them difficult to fold. Material is fine, but these are shoved in the back of the drawer & not used.",2
"Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman, White/Beige","I wasn't willing to spend a lot of money on a glider.  This glider is perfect for me.  It was packaged well. The directions were easy and it only took my husband about 15-20 mins to put together.  I purchased the beige cushions with the white frame.  The color was exactly what I expected it to be. The glider will go well in my nursery.  I should also mention that it glides smoothly.  Some reviewers have complained about the smallish size, but with my feet on the ottoman it isn't noticable (I'm 5'6). The back cushion is quite comfortable. I am happy with my purchase.",4
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Animal Pacifier, 0-6 Months, Style and Color May Vary, 2-Pack",I only buy the event brand pacifiers because that is the only kind my son likes. Great product at a great price!,5
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"I absolutely love my Baby Bjorn.  I have used it with my two babies and I cannot reccommend this item highly enough.  I have used the Baby Bjorn more hours than my 3 strollers combined.It is a little difficult to get the hang of the straps at first but once everything is adjusted correctly, it is very simple.  Both of my babies were in the carrier by 4 weeks in a rear facing set up.  They both loved being so close to me and I loved having my hands free to cook or walk.I turned them both around to face forward around 3 months but would sometimes turn them back around once they fell asleep.My first baby outgrew the carrier around 9 months because he was too heavy and too long but I still use it with my second baby who just turned a year.After three years of use, the carrier functions perfectly but the black color has faded and it looks a little beat up.  I have washed the front cushion part many times due to teething and spit up.  It washes very well.I hope you and your babies enjoy your Baby Bjorn as much as we did!",5
Pretty Pony Horse Toddler Bedding 5 pc set by Sweet Jojo Designs,"My little horse lover loves this bedding. I am picky about liking stuff that is cotton and this set has a great cotton feel, soft and comfy.  The stitching is well done and having the horses made out of different material makes them really stand out. (they are quilted on not painted.)  The pillow, bottom sheet and top sheet are all 3 pink with pink gingham trim on the pillow and top sheet.  My only complaint is the top sheet is a little small, while it will tuck in it won't stay tucked in on both sides when my little one is in bed.  If your kid likes a bed with one tucked side this should work great, but for my daughter who likes to sleep in a double tucked bed we have had to rely on tucking the comforter to make it like she likes it.",5
"Kolcraft Contours Options Tandem Stroller, Ruby",I am very happy with this stroller.. It fits easily in the back of my trunk.. I bought an additional car seat attachment since the stroller just comes with one.  I always just put the babies in the carseats and put them into the attachments on the stroller and we're good to go!  It has a LOT of room at the bottom.  Enough to store the diaper bag and my purse (and bags if you are shopping)!! I keep my keys and phone in between the cup holders (bottle holders).  I would highly recommend. Just remember to light the handle bars UP before trying to close the stroller.,5
Safe-Plate Outlet Cover - 25pk - Almond,These covers were too thick for my outlets.  When installed the progs on plug were not able to get far enough into the outlet to get power.,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Small, Circle Bear","We tried many different types of swaddle blankets (e.g. the Miracle Blanket, etc.) and the Kiddopotamus was the only one that worked right.The Miracle Blanket definitely kept our baby swaddled, but it literally took 2 of us to get it on her correctly, and it was such an ordeal that she was very upset by the time we were finished.  In contrast, the Kiddopotamus is extremely easy to work with and wraps your baby up very quickly.My only word of advice is to buy the cotton knit instead of the flannel.  We thought that the cotton knit would stretch more than the flannel (and indeed it does), but we thought this would make the cotton knit less effective (as in the baby would be able to get out more easily); however, what we found is that the stretchiness allows you to wrap it more tightly and effectively than the cotton flannel.Also out of 3 flannel ones we bought, 2 tore holes in them very promptly.  And even though the cotton knit was used probably 10 times more often than the flannel, it never tore a hole.",5
"Baby Jogger 2011 City Mini Single Stroller, Black/Black","My husband and I love this stroller.We purchased the infant car seat converter, and have used this stroller from day one.  Once the converter was installed, it was easy to transfer the carrier from the car to the stroller and back again.Now that baby is 7 months old, we strap her in without the infant seat.  It is easy to strap her in and she sits comfortably.  The full recline is great; she has napped in there easily on long trips, especially because we can also move the large canopy to almost completely cover her while she's in there.As a small-framed woman, it is also easy for me to remove and set up the stroller.  The one strap fold is genius!  This is like a light BOB, but an extra-souped up umbrella stroller at the same time.  We don't foresee needing another stroller for a long time.The only cons are that the storage is lacking (and inaccessible when baby is in full recline) and that it doesn't come with any ""extras"" (cup holder, etc.).  We have done fine without them so far, but will probably need to splurge on them soon (when we take baby on trips to theme parks, the zoo, etc.).Caveat: this is our first baby and the only stroller we've purchased, but for first-time, inexperienced parents, it has been a lifesaver.",5
"Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey","Comfy and doesn't get pee everywhere! After going thru quite a few potty seats, this is my favorite one! It's a pretty color, super comfy for your LO and it stays clean! Only wish it had a hook for the toilet tank.",5
"Dena Happi Tree Hamper, Pink","This Hamper turned out to be very nice, it seems well made/sturdy and holds a lot...enough for more than a week of infant clothes.",5
Sassy Clarified Fascination Station Suction Toy,"The suction cup completely fails.  Does not work at all. Received this item as a gift, would have given it 1 star but when I hold it in my hand my son likes playing with it.  It's just completely useless unless I'm holding it because if he holds it he will end up wacking himself in the mouth with it.  Fix the suction cup and it would be an AMAZING toy.",2
"Bumbleride Travel Bag for Indie, Black",We just finished our sixth flight with this bag and it has always protected our Indie Bumbleride and the bag still looks like new.  We've only checked it at the ticket counter so I imagine it takes a beating.  I find it easy to put in and out of the bag and have never had a problem with it fitting in the bag.  I watched a how-to video online and practiced at home the first time.It would be good to have more labeling that the bag contains a stroller but I do it myself using paper tape/marker.  The price is a bit steep but it's worth the investment so you don't have to replace your stroller.,4
"Baby Starters Plush Snuggle Buddy, Blue Monkey",For me it doesn't worth $10.00. At Walmart it should be less than $5.00 including taxes. True that it is pink and soft but clearly not worth giving 5 stars.,2
green sprouts by i play. Sprout Ware Infant Spoon - Boy - 10 pk,It is small as it should be for little babies that are eating solids for the first time. My baby is really happy with these spoons.,5
"Kid'Sleep Classic, Blue","My daughter was waking up earlier and earlier in the morning and would not go back to sleep.  My wife and I tried everything to get her to stay quite until everybody else in the family woke up but to no avail.  We thought we would try this clock as a last ditch effort and to our amazement after about a week our daughter """"got it"""" and would be quite until the cow would """"wake up"""".  This has definitely been a huge blessing for us and we highly recommend it.",5
"Burlington Baby Moses Basket with Liner, White",This bassinet was exactly what I needed. I wanted a bassinet that was larger in size since my babies tend to be large when they are born and the smaller bassinets are too small in just a few weeks. This bassinet is very spacious and easy to move around your home. I love it!!!,5
"Kids Line Dena Happi Tree Velour Changing Pad Cover, Pink",We bought this net because my daughter has several stuffed animals that she isn't willing to part with but she hardly ever plays with them. I got so tired of picking them up everyday so I finally found this product! It is really big and durable and holds all of her animals (around 20-30) some of them being a little heavier as well (electronic toys). Does exactly what I wanted it to do and doesnt sag or fall down at all!,5
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"We were given a very nice Graco car seat and base for our new baby, so we didn't want to register for an entire new travel system, but we liked the idea of the convenience for those occasions when we do need a stroller.The stroller frame was very easy to assemble. I'm petite, and getting it in and out of the car is very easy for me, though it does take two hands to fold and unfold. The car seat attaches securely and it feels sturdy. My only major complaint is that the ride is very rough on asphalt, so it isn't good for walking with my baby in the neighborhood for exercise.This product meets our needs and was a good buy.",4
"Stork Craft Hoop Glider, Cherry/Beige","When the glider arrived, we found out that one hole on the back frame, through which the armrest is fastens to the back frame, was missing.Then, we ordered a replacement.When the replacement came, both of the two upper horizontal bars of the base were broken.I am done with it. very disappointed.",1
Loopy Baby Rattle Holder - Pink &amp; Brown Damask,"I was very disapointed with the item, when we first got it, it was great, my daughter lost her first sophie so this was great till about two weeks later when the stitching came apart and now it can't be used any longer...",1
Jeep Wrangler Twin Sport All-Weather Umbrella Stroller,"We have three children, ages 2 mos to 3 years, and we use this stroller with all three. The seats fold down flat enough that, with use of the seat belt and a head support, our infant does just fine in it. Our 2 year and 3 year old love it because they can sit side by side and talk, share snacks, etc. The only problem we have had with it is that, in 18 mos worth of serious wear and tear (i.e. a dozen plane trips, two vacations, and weekly use at the zoo), the clip that holds it together when folded has gotten warped and so sometimes pops off. The cure? We wrap a luggage strap around it when flying- the rest of the time it is no big deal.We actually have a double jogging stroller (which cost 3x as much) that, while we loved it for about 2 mos), we haven't used since our second child was 3 mos old. It is big and bulky, and it much more difficult to maneuver. The Jeep double umbrella stroller has been great.",5
"Bumkins Waterproof Starterbib, Blue Fizz","I bought this thinking it was a Superbib.  We have 2 Superbibs and love them.  This product popped up when I searched for ""superbib"" and the picture looks like my Superbib.  But it's not.  If you are looking for a superbib, do not buy this product.  I am giving it 5 stars however, because Bumkin bibs are awesome and my gripe is with the labelling of this product.",5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,My little one loves to play with this. It is smaller than I expected but it was perfect for her little hands and she loved the noise that makes when the sides click-clack together.,5
"Safety 1st Clic It Universal Infant Car Seat Carrier,  Black/Silver",Can you use this with a toddler convertible car seat?? I need a travel system but was wondering if I can purchase this and use it with a toddler car seat,5
The Original Tummy Tub Baby Bath - Clear,"As a new grandmother, but a well experienced mom, baby sitter and licensed day care provider, this is the best baby tub I've used.  Bought one for m'new grand baby... and keep it handy, because he loves it!  Follow directions: tepid water, not to exceed the clearly marked water line, and hold up the little tyke's chinny-chin-chin!  And voila!  Your baby will love it!  The serene look on our wee one's face told the story.  Just before we popped him in, he was howling... when he found himself in the water, he smiled!  Must be reminiscent of being in the womb!  I'm keeping this tub for the next baby... after that, I'll use it for a flower pot!  Won't his college friends love to hear the story!?",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,I tried to use this while pregnant but for me it was too thick and firm.  However it did make a great tool for propping up our newborn's mattress because he needs to sleep elevated due to reflux.,2
"Dream On Me Full Size 2 in 1 Folding Stationary Side Crib, Espresso","Unless you just have to have a folding crib, don't buy from this company.  The product is just ok once assembled but the instructions are less than adequate.  They're printed on the bottom of the crib, not in a booklet with pictures as you would expect.  In addition, the original order came with the plastic sealed container of screws, nuts, bolts, washers, etc. torn open and some pieces missing.  When I requested replacements, I received a 5&#34; x 7&#34; cardboard container stuffed with miscellaneous parts.  I finally broke down and bought the washers I needed.Assembly was an expected pain but once you figure out the pattern, it goes relatively smoothly.  I did split a piece of one rail because all the screws were one size instead of 2 different sizes listed on the parts list and I wound up using the larger screw.  All in all, not worth the money.",2
Bella B Stretch Mark Prevention Stick,"The scent is nice. However, it is greasy and sticky and stays that way all day. I do not like how it makes my skin feel on the outside, but I am sure it's doing good things for it. I wouldn't let any clothes come into contact with it that I care about. There's not much of the product so I'll probably use it until it's gone (I give it 2 months max) and then try something new.",3
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","I bought 2 of the Britax Frontier seats for my 5 yr old daugher & my 6 1/2 yr old son and they are by far the best seats I've had so far.  They were pretty easy to install if your car has the latches & the tether hooks.  I installed them myself without any help from my husband and had both of them done in about 45 minutes.  Once installed, they are very secured.  I love the harness of these carseats because they do give a lot of slack when you need it and the buckle that sits on the seat can be adjusted accordingly to my kids height and size.  All the carseats I've had, the harness straps are designed in such a way that they are hard to buckle and there is never enough slack so my kids feel tight and uncomfortable.  I did a lot of research before I decided on Britax.  And I am very happy with my decision because of the ease of use and the safety features of this carseat.  My kids love the seats and they said they are very comfortable.  And the harness straps are easy to buckle and get in and out of so no more struggling to get them strapped down anymore.",5
Clippasafe Natural Wooden Playpen with Mat,"My neice just had a new baby and she and husband loves this item for her. Thank you very much amazon, and Hello baby",5
,"I looked for ages to find a solution for sectioning off our basement .... this arrived and fit the bill perfectly. It was easy to configure and install - we have fixed it at either end.I was initially disappointed with the taupe colour (a light grey) - white would have been better - but it is not offensive and actually doesn't annoy me as I thought it might.It is rigid enough for our 11 month old to pull up on without a problem, the gate is easy to operate with one hand which is important when carrying an infant.The only reason it doesn't score a 5* rating is that it doesn't lock in position completely which would have made it 100%.  It is possible to move it slightly when it is in position but that's not a really great issue for us so far.We did decide to purchase a Regalo 4 in 1 gate for the family room fireplace as it comes with the 8 panels we need without the need to purchase an extension set, however that is going straight back (I have reviewed that separately) and we have just ordered the Superyard with extension set - it is well worth the additional cost based on its appearance, quality and gate latch and I will happily live with the taupe colour!",4
Hygeia EnJoye EPS Breast Pump with External Power Supply,"i received this pump through the wic program. This electric pump is great. I've been using it for 3months now. My favorite part about the Hygeia pump is you can record your baby's hungry cry on it. Just hold the record button down next to ur baby and let go when your finished press play. The cry help stimulate me to produce more milk in order to pump more milk out. i also like the speed setting that the Hygeia Enjoye has as well, for those rush days at work. And if you do not have a power source it comes with its own battery pack to go wireless. Its light and easy to carry around but very big for a pump. The Hygeia pump can also be use as a single pump as well. Overall I will recommend this product to anyone.",5
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow","I bought this for baby's stroller bassinet, in which she also sleeps at night. We cut it down to perfectly match the shape of the oval mattress, which it protected perfectly from the occasional mid-sleep diaper explosion. So happy with this purchase that we bought it in a bigger size to protect the crib.",5
Combi Dakota Booster Car Seat Pattern: Jade,"I don't think this seat is as good as the reviews I've read.  It's fine, just not spectacularly comfortable, etc.  My daughter is 4 1/2 years old, 40 inches tall and just at the 33 pound requirement for this seat.  (most are 40 min. required) We needed a new booster as she has grown too tall for the old carseat.  This one has probably a little more padding than a Graco cheaper one, but not as much as I would have liked.  Also, I wished I had bought a full size seat as my daughter ends up all hunched over when sleeping on a long car trip.  But my daughter claims to love it (probably because she can unbuckle -not buckle- her own seat now and says she's a big girl!",4
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White",Fits the Pack 'N Play perfectly and is more like a real crib mattress than the rock hard pad that comes with it.  I bought one for both of my Pack 'N Plays because they were too hard and I could never get the fold seam to lay flat.,5

"Summer Infant SwaddleMe Adjustable Infant Wrap, 3-Pack, Mom &amp; Baby",I'm awful at swaddling and never got the hang of a tight swaddle. This definitely made bed time quicker and kept him asleep much better.,5
"Baby Trend Nursery Center Playard, Safari Kingdom",This definitely looks better in person. My little one love looking at the mobile and the diaper holder in the front is convenient. Was well worth the money.,5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"We purchased this monitor unit with an add-on camera for both my kids' rooms. They were very inexpensive but well-worth the money. They are clear in sound and picture. When I had questions about syncing the unit to the cameras, the customer service for the product was unbelievably helpful. I would definitely buy another camera for the 3rd baby's room when he/she arrives.",5
"Momo Baby Skid-proof Silicone Placemat, Blue","I was very disappointed with this place mat.  The bottom side leaves a gross film on my table, and the place mat is difficult to clean.",1
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","I sure have been happy with this product. I understand that it doesn't work well in winter months but it still worked better and is alot less frustrating than all the other junk we wasted money on during the summer months in Wisconsin. I wish they were a bit larger though but so many windows are different and i get it. I am planning on buying another set soon. Thank You britex for the free with car seat purchase and you win, im buying another set!  five stars at this point",4
Summer Infant Sure And Secure Extra Tall Top Of The Stairs Gate With Alarm,"We purchased this gate for the top of a wide staircase- liked that it was wider than most gates and would fit securely. My husband is very handy and it still took 1 1/2 hours (and much swearing) to put it in. Now that it's in, we find that it is taking both hands and a foot to get it open- probably because it is so wide, but it is hard to use! The screws were cheap, the wall mounts are plastic, and the latch is too difficult to open with one hand (as advertised on the box!!). I wish I had read all the reviews before I purchased it- now my husband is removing the gate so that we can take another trip back to Babies R Us! Save yourself a trip and don't buy this stinker.",1
Sesame Street Baby Extra Soft Fleece Blanket,I got this for my granddaughter and she loves sleeping with it. IT's very colorful and so very soft. I recommend for any new born baby or toddler.,5
"Sassy 2 Count Stroller/Car Seat Toy, Chime Birds",My baby loves this. It's cute and it's sound is just lovely. It's easily taken from car seat to jungle gym and etc.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is simply the best slip-over potty seat out there.  The adjusting dial underneath allows it to fit snugly over oblong or round toilet seats, so there's no slipping around on the potty.  I recommend this especially for boys because it doesn't require a special flip-up piece in the front.  Also, the hole is a little bigger than the cheaper models, so I would recommend this for average-sized 3+ kids.  My son is over 5 now, and he still has to use this, so it defintely will last a long time as far as age of the child and sturdiness of the product.  It cleans up easily, too.",5
"C.R. Gibson Bound Keepsake Memory Book of Baby's First 5 Years, Lulu",This book looks very nice and it made a great gift for my new granddaughter that was born today 7-3-2013.,5
"Baby Jogger City Select Single Stroller, Onyx","I loved this pram from the moment I received it. It is so light, non bulky for in the back of the car and is so easy to get around with.  I also purchased a 2nd seat for when my next one comes along.  I used my Safe n sound Unity capsule on this pram and it was brilliant.  I've had so many great comments where ever I go with it.",5

"Badger Basket Baby Changing Table with Hamper and Basket, Espresso","I really like this changing table.  It is a great value for the price and the quality of the product.  It was missing a shelf and a screw from the box, but we sent in a request and it was shipped to us within 3 days.",4
"Kids Line Carry All Printed Diaper Bag, Lime Ginko",I have to say when I ordered this I was rather afraid. I was pleasantly surprised I will say it is MUCH bigger then I thought it would be but now that my little guy is eating solids and we have to pack food its perfect the only draw back I have found with this bag is that the inside pockets don't have good enough elastic in them and tend not to contain the diapers/changing pad causing a slight jumble in the bottom of the bag if I don't pack it JUST so....but this bag MORE then makes up for thatpro's-the straps *not the detachable one* but the two handles are STILL long enough to sling over my shoulder when needed-the stroller straps/cart straps are easy and fast and make fitting everything & a baby in a shopping cart a LOT easier-I abuse it horribly and it STILL looks very clean-All the pockets are good size and shapes for bottles diapers ect.-the top can zip closed which is nice if its raining but I rarely remember to but it hasn't tipped and dumped on me once...even when my lil' guy pushes it over or uses it to pull himself up on it doesn't spill!,4
Summer Infant 4-Sided Changing Pad,"When I was expecting (Dec of '09), I looked all over for a changing pad that had four sides on it.  Most stores only carried the kind that had two and I wanted one with four so my baby would be secured from all sides.  I found this one here on Amazon, and loved the fact that this is made out of Peva vinyl (not the PVC which is harmful).  I've had it now for over 16 months and I love it.  It's very cushy and comfortable for my little one, and at 16 months she still likes to lay on it.  I always keep a changing pad cover on it, so that if there's a mess I can just remove the cover and throw it in the wash.  There have been a few instances when there wasn't a cover on it and my daughter made a mess on the vinyl, and I just wiped it clean with a wipe.  About those changing pad covers...most of them will fit with no problem.  You just pull up on the corners a bit so it's not stretched across the middle of the pad.  I highly recommend this changing pad, you will be happy with it!",5
"Ameda CustomFit Breast Flanges, XL/XXL","I ordered these and was in for a BIG surprise.  I didn't realize that they were size L/XL until I opened the box.  Unless you have very large breast, you won't want this product.  I use the Ameda standard size (25 mm) and the Medium size (28.5 mm) works too.  If you have size A-B breasts either of the standard or medium sizes will work.  If your breasts are larger, than perhaps this is the product for you.Overall, I feel that the listing should have the size in the title.",3
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,"great latches! I use them for all kinds of baby proofing. Perfect for toilet. I have not yet tried to remove them, they seem very secure.",5
"FuzziBunz Nursing Pads, White, 6 Pack","These pads are very soft and comfortable to wear, especially if you have sore nipples. I definitely recommend for nursing mothers.",5
"Britax Parkway SGL Belt-Positioning Booster Seat, Cub Pink","Much lighter weight than I had expected; installed well - if you watch the videos, then the ""floppy seat"" is not an issue.  You just need to click it in place.  My 4.7 year-old fits very comfortably and broke it in on a 6 hour road trip (in more ways than one....the seat covers have already been removed (easily) and washed).  Loving the cup holders - never knew how much I loved them until we had one without them.  Lots of nice padding, love the safety features and the latch system.  The seatbelt has no hang problems as others noted - works like a charm.  Now, proof is in the pudding....I hope we never have to prove it.  So far, so good, and yes, the fabric cleaned well.",5
"South Shore Angel Changing Table, Espresso",Great durable item for a great price :)Alot of assembly but well worth it. Love the finish of the wood color,5
"Bummis Super Whisper Wrap, White, 30 Pounds","These are great basics for any cloth diaper stash.  The leg gussets are comfortable (looking, I admit, I haven't worn them myself!) and they keep the wetness inside.  It's nice to be able to use them a time or two before washing. The print is cute but in the future I'd probably save a buck or two and just go for white since I nearly never have baby in just a diaper and she doesn't care what it looks like.  Maybe for older babies it would be an issue.",5
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink",I've had this product for about a month now and it's perfect for washing my 2-year daughter's hands.  She can balance herself better on the stool because she doesn't have to lean over as much.,5
"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red","I purchased this stroller to use for my four month old and on the first trip out, he banged his head on the side bar and got a huge bump on his head. I had to bring him to the pediatrician to ensure that he was not really injured.  I would not recommend this stroller for any child under at least 8 months old.",1
Tenergy T-1199BE Universal NiMH Battery Charger,"This is a good charger and works well. It is not a rapid charger if that is what you are looking for, but this charger unit really does a great job. Set it and forget it. I love that it shuts itself off.",4
"FunBites Shaped Food Cutter Set, Green/Pink","I've been using these on pancakes, waffles, cheese and toast mostly for my 1 year old. It's a quick and fun little cutter. The square are my favorite but the older kids like the hearts because it has a few different shapes on it. The only time I had problems with this or thought it was messy was when I was using it wrong. It's not a press! If you try to press the food through using both parts, it's a mess but that's not how it's used. Just use the one piece (with the handles) to cut it and then the second piece to loosen any pieces if you need.",5
"Carter's Wall Decals, Monkey Rockstar","I love elephants and these decals fit the bill!  They are cute, easy to apply, and made of thick plastic.",5
Estone Cute Crocodile Baby Infant Bath Tub Thermometer Water Temperature Tester Toy,"I should have listened to my other half when he said we didn't really need this. It was so cheap though and adorable. The temp gauge is strip of that heat reactive material, like when I was a kid in the 80's they had these you could hold on your childs forehead to take his temperature. It's also only in Celsius, which I realize the rest of world uses, but not here in the States. The delivery took forever, which is always a shock since I'm so used to Amazon Prime. (Wasn't avail) In any event this thing is cute sitting around gathering dust. Another impulse buy I might have passed on.",3
"Joovy Nook Highchair, White Leatherette","We love this high chair. Bought one for our home because of a recommendation by my cousin (who has two for her twins) and liked it so much we bought another for our other house! Easy to clean, simple to use, folds up nicely with a convenient carrying handle, lightweight yet very sturdy. I would recommend this high chair to anyone. My only ""complaint"" is that I wish it had an adjustable setting that you could lean the seat back. I probably would have only used that feature when my baby was younger but it would have been a nice added feature although I really don't miss it. My 9 month old uses this seat every day!As for the other reviews complaining of the gap, I have never ever had a problem with this. Of course there is a gap, but there is a 5 pt harness and a bar between the legs so your baby is secure and -breaking news- your baby is going to find a way to get messy no matter what, whether or not there is a gap! :) also, the tray is super simple to open, even with one hand.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"this is a great toy!! the material is really great, is very easy to squeeze and teething friendly (it seems to be great to bite on) and it also is really pretty.!!",5
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips spill Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Red/Green","they do not leak at all! Which is amazing! My daughter likes them a lot too. Are a bit big to fit in cup holders, but not a big deal since they never leak.",5
Smart Mom Teething Bling Donut Shaped Pendant Necklace (Bronze),"My daughter seemed to know as soon as I put this necklace on that it was for her too.  It went right in her mouth (which my other jewelry never does) and she started chomping away.  She always gets excited when I put it on.  So I would wear it even if it was silly looking, but as an added bonus, I think it's a cute piece of jewelry.  Just my style.  And apparently, my baby's.  Love it!",5
"Graco Pack 'n Play Changing Pad Cover, Cream",They are convenient for the diaper bag.  Easy to wash and very water proof.  Nice value for the money I spent.,5
"Kids Preferred The World of Eric Carle Toy, Mr. Seahorse","Mr Seahorse is one of our favorite board books, so I couldn't help but buy the toy. My son loves it so far. It's crinkly, has a bell inside and makes bubble noises when you squeeze the tail. There's lots of different textures for him to chew on, and the baby seahorse comes out of the pouch but is attached by a short cord so it won't get lost. Though there appears to be 3 babies in the photo, our toy only came with one. Otherwise everything is great.",5
"Kushies 6 Pack Wash Cloth Set, White",I got these along with the Spasilk 10 Pack one that's also popular and they are exactly the same except for the colors. Each of them is thinner than a slice of cheese and its hard to grip when ur scrubbing normally. I bought them for my face and I wish they were a little rougher because they don't get all the oil and makeup off my face as nicely as I would like them too. They are also really hard to grip because they stretch and are super small. I have only washed them once so far and they are already starting to roll in on the ends.,3
*SAFETY CLASP &amp; SAFETY KNOTTED* Bouncy Baby Boutique(TM) - Certified Authentic Baltic Amber Teething Necklace - N32 Raw Multicolor,If I could give this 0 stars I would! I received this necklace in the mail and it felt like plastic! I did 3 tests to check the authenticity of this necklace. It failed each one. Amber floats in water. It sank. Amber smells like sap when hot. It smelt like plastic. Amber glows with a black light. It didn't. I even took it our local jeweler to check the authenticity. They said it wasn't Amber! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,1
GroVia 100% Organic Cotton Cloth Wipes - 12 Pack,"I recommend the Lion Heart Wipe warmer, it's wonderful and the wipes that come with it are sooooo much better.  I have ordered more of those after WASTING money on two 12-packs of these.  Don't waste your money!!!",1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,This seat was exactly what I was looking for. My son is really tall to the seats with bars across the legs just don't work for him. Now he wants to sit no where else! It is a rubbery material to so it's comfortable for him and not easy to tear up or break. It also has little grips on the bottom that help it stay on the chair.,5
"Simple Wishes D Lite Hands Free Breastpump Bra, Soft Pink, Large to Plus Size","I am very happy I decided to buy this - I am using it with the Medela pump and it works perfectly.  I also wanted to comment that the item I received had clasps in the back as it is pictured, I know some people were receiving another bra that tied in the back, that was not the case for me.  it fits very securely, and I feel like the adjustable back works great!  I am a 38 DD right now and the bra supports enough for what it is supposed to do.  I would recommend!",5

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","My husband is tall and can easily keep this on for longer activities. I did better in 20-30 min increments of time, especially as our son got older. We are now planning to use this with our second baby and excited to bring it out again.  Super easy to use and works well for the first six to eight months (depending on size and weight of baby).  This is definitely a purchase that should be added to any baby shopping list.  And there are lots of things you never know if you will use, but this was one we got our money's worth!  One note, we had a small to average size baby.  My sister's baby is twice his size and I can see how a larger / above average baby would get less use of this.",5
"Graco SimpleSwitch Highchair and Booster, Pasadena","Was looking for a comfy high chair for my chubby legged little guy. I refuse to purchase anything wooden (too slippery and hard for a baby's bottom) and with only a &#34;crotch strap&#34; (those just look painful) so this was perfect! The tray slides in multiple positions, the chair reclines nicely, plenty of &#34;chubby legged&#34; room under the tray and the owl pattern is simply adorable!! Also the tray is quite large which my little guy loves b/c it holds ALL his toys. :) He loves his high chair which in turn, makes us love it!",5
"Baby Jogger City Mini Single Stroller, Teal/Gray","I love the city mini brand.  This stroller is absolutely the best stroller out there.  I've worked at a baby store for several years now and I have to say, we all love the city mini brand. Really what wins this over is it's strap folding system.  This one step folding strap is easy for anyone.  I recommend it for new moms and grandparents because it is so light and easy to fold.  DO NOT be fooled by the other brands that have an 'easy' fold strap to them, many of those cheaper ones may look the same (aka Graco's easy folds) but they are no where near the ease of the City Mini's.I understand some people are upset that there is no cup holder or tray, but honestly you can buy a generic brand for $5 (usually they are bigger too). Most of the time, those strollers that come with all those accessories included are awful.  Those strollers with 3 or more cup holders are just trying to get you to overlook it's weak frame or terrible folding system. And yes, this stroller is expensive, but it is so worth it.The material this stroller is made to last you a long time and it's easy to clean, so you don't have to worry about that color looking gross a couple of months down the line.  The reason it's called a &#34;jogger&#34; stroller is because it's a &#34;jogging&#34; style (3 wheels), I would not recommend this stroller for real athletes.  The basket is pretty small, the reason is because it needs to be slim for the folding mechanism to work smoothly.Seriously, I have seen a lot of strollers (both high and low end ones) and the City Mini is still my favorite.",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,This was a gift to my daughter for my second Grandson and she is extremely pleased with the low level of noise it can pick up and the distance the monitors can be from each other.SHE LOVES IT!,5
"Badger Basket Modern Changing Table with 3 Baskets and Hamper, White","Overall this seems to be a good product.  I just built it a few days ago, and it was relatively easy to do since all the parts were labeled with stickers that matched the instruction manual.  There were no dings or scratches and the color was a solid white.The one drawback is that the pre-drilled holes that are meant to be for the vertical pole separating the drawers from the laundry basket were drilled to far to the left......when I screwed in the floors for the shelves, the torque of securing them pulled the vertical pole to the right and cracked one of them.  I did not notice until I heard the cracking sound since I was using an electric screwdriver.  So now I have to leave the shelves not all the way screwed in to allow a little gap between the vertical support and the shelf.  It does not look horrible, but it is something of a design flaw.Other slightly weird thing is that the baskets are not white....they are a slight grey.  It is mostly due to the fact that they are a thin material and being thin, it is hard to be a really clean white.  Once again, it does not look horrible, but it is something of a letdown when compared to the images shown on Amazon.",3

"NUK/Gerber Seal N Go Disposible Liner, 50-Count",Great bags! I've tried several different brands and these are by far the best I've found. Only one out of 200+ has leaked. The plastic feels thicker than any of the others I've tried and they are easy to label. I will continue to use these for the duration of my pumping:),5
MyLine Baby PlayMat-Yellow-Extra Thick,"First time write a review, as I truly this playmat is good:))  worth the money.But, I have never use others",5
"MAM Training Toothbrush, Blue, 6 Plus Months","I have a 21 months old son. I started cleaning his teeth when he is about 1 yr old. First I started w/ those NUK infant set (paste+finger toothbrush) I almost got my fingers bit off a few times. Plus the bristles on the finger toothbrush (TB) were falling off and I once found a piece stuck in my son's teeth. Time to move on. As more teeth poping out, we switched to real TB (still kid's version thou) NUK toddler set .The drawback is the head of the TB is too big so my son didn't like it and he tends to bite on it hard (i am just glad it's not my finger) and it would also cause reflux. So everytime I brush him, it's like a battle....until my wife got this MAM one. It got way smaller head and longer handle so it's easier for me to handle. It's good quality too. If you buy it, you won't regret it.Now, how to brush the teeth. I tried all kinds of positions and the best is this: I lay my son's head on the toilet seat cover which is covered by soft toilet seat cover. Then I lay his lower half of the body on my lap while I sit on a stool next to him. So now he is lying there and I am over him like a dentist over a patient. I can see all his teeth and can brush him this way more easily. If you have been struggling with brushing your kids' teeth, you may want to give it a try. The key is both of you are in relaxed position and you are over his/her mouth. Good luckBut do buy this brush. It's worth the $.",5
Britax Frontier Booster Car Seat,"My son is large for a 2 year old so this seat was perfect.  he loves the arm rest and the cup holder.  we had originally purchased the recardo 5 point harness seat but found it snug fit for our son, even though the seat was good up to 80 pounds.  we would recommend the frontier.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I got this for my grandbaby because I only have a stall shower at my house.  This tub works very well set in the stall shower for an infant.  It would work fine in tub also I think.  Very sturdy - very nice and as baby gets bigger you turn it around.  Once they are really standing - it is not so good.  I then got the Stokke Flexi Bath Folding Baby Bath - and that works really well - she is now two and it still works well.,5
"JJ Cole Mode Diaper Tote Bag, Cocoa Tree","I love this diaper bag. It has great space, many pockets, and so cute. But, it didn't come with care instructions and anything wet will leave a water mark. Not the best thing when it comes to a baby diaper bag.",4
"Baby Einstein Rattle and Teethe, Caterpillar, Colors May Vary","Got as a gift for my nephew who is in beginning state of teething.

The very first time time he held it, he refused to give it up!! SO GLAD I GOT THIS!!!!",5
"Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx",I really like this seat. It's easy to put my baby in and out of it. My baby looks super comfortable in it! It's a bit bulky but most convertible car seats are and if its for my baby's safety I'll deal with it.,5
Boppy Changing Pad Liners 3-Pack - White,"These liners are made of good quality and are very durable even after washing.  With my 2 month old, I have had to put these liners in the wash a couple of times, and it still amazes me how they remain their shape.  I am very happy with this product and will purchase again. :)",5

Cosco Scenera Convertible Seat - Rising Tide,"I found this seat on consumer reports.  It rated high on safety, and it was cheap.  It got low marks for ease of use due to the buckle system.Since then, I've purchased 5 of these bad boys.  I really dont like flying with a car seat.  Like a bike helmet, they can be damaged and lose effectiveness.  I've sent them to:  Grandma1, Grandpa2, grandma and grandpa3.  The other two we use at home, one for our car and one for the Nanny.This was all over about 7 months.  The first three had the buckles that got the knock by consumer reports.  The last two were these.  They have an updated buckle that is much better (really, the old was easy, and for $40 couldnt be beat) in terms of getting set.  That said, it basically saves you 5 seconds when buckling the kid in...max.  So...non issue.Anyway, 5 of these at $40-$50 and we are at about $220-$250.  Thats less than alot of these car seats I see people buying, and I havent paid for a single one to get checked on a plane, or (and this is the great part) had to lug one through an airport!",4
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,I normally used my electric medela pump but if I'm going to a friend's house for a few hours I didn't want to take my electric pump with me.  This was handy and if there was a blackout I wouldn't have to worry about being in pain from not being able to pump.,5

"Boba Classic Baby Carrier, Dusk","Not sure what happened to our previous review, but it apparently didn't show up unless it hooked up with another product by accident.  This carrier is simply outstanding.  It was gotten for our daughter's use, and she has used other ""back packs"" for her children before.  But this one is superior to anything she's had in the past.  They use it for hiking and general out-and-about activities, and her 18 month old loves being in it.  Recently he was sick and very fussy, and she could not get any work done around the house.  She put him in this carrier, and within minutes he fell peacefully asleep, allowing her to get the needed housework done with him comfortably sleeping on her back - a win-win situation!  She cannot say enough about this product, and even said she'd gladly have paid retail price for it if she'd had to buy it for herself.",5

"Graco SmartSeat All-in-One Car Seat, Jemma","If you are looking for a long lasting car seat for your little one, then this is it! A bit on the pricier side to the middle class single parent, BUT safety is definitely NOT a question with this car seat. I do find it a little difficult to strap my child in wearing a winter coat while using the extra padding in the RF position. The straps can only be adjusted so much with regards to the height requirement detailed in the instructions. Just knowing that this seat grows with my child and protects virtually EVERYWHERE, is SO wonderful and exciting! AWESOME product! HIGHLY recommended.",5

Eddie Bauer Infant Car Seat tan,"In answer to Lisa, about where to find.  We have only been able to find the double stroller in this pattern.  I've scoured the web for any indication there is a single and have yet to locate it.  My husband loved this pattern and I figured if he finally got excited about something I should let him pick.  If you find a single let me know.  Otherwise the double one should be in your local babierus store.",4
"Art 4 Kids &quot;Potter Floppy Hat&quot; Mounted Art Print, 16&quot;x20&quot;","I had a framed needlepoint clown hanging in my granddaughter's bedroom at my house that I had made for my son 30 years ago.  However, she (2 years old ) was not fond of it and I had to take it down.This was the repalcement and she loves it!  She's happy, I'm happy.",4
New Pink Minky Dot Chenille Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,It was more than I expected for the price. Everyone likes it and compliments that its perfect for a newborn baby girl. Sweet looking and very soft comforter blanket. I can arrange it WI th any pink/white nursery decor.,5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Crib 'N Go Projector Soother,"I rather like this. It's not a miracle worker, but I do feel like it's something soothing and familiar that we can use nightly and take along on vacations and trips to grandma's house.  My only complaints are that I wish it had a remote, and I wish it played longer than 12 minutes.",4
,"Good for any hipster kids you know who are about to have kids.  Be aware though, the nipple is the now-classic Gerber nipple which none of my kids have ever liked.  The edges are a little sharp.  Overall though, the price is good and the pacifier is absolutely adorable.",4
"Nuby 2 Pack Insulated No Spill Straw Cup, 9 Ounce, Colors May Vary","This bottle is good in that it does not leak, BUT my toddler has bitten through and ingested someone of the straw. Also, I did not realize until I received the package that this product does not say it is BPA free. I will not be purchasing again and have to throw out the product after a single use due to the straw damage.",1
Clay Hanging Keepsake Kit (Makes 2 Plaques),"This worked perfectly for what I wanted to do.  I was skeptical after reading so many negative reviews but it made awesome handprints of my 3 year old son and 7 month old daughter. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the """"rolling pin"""" was usesless and the circle cutter was small for the size I needed for my son.",4
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size.  My son is at the top end of the size large weight range, but this item will still fit him for many months.  Instead, look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination.  My tall son is growing out of size 18-24 month clothing, but the size large sleepsack (size 12-18 months) will fit him for many more months.",5

"Foundations Lullaby Adult Glider Rocker, Natural",The chair itself is great but not so much the cushions.  The cushions are ill fitting.  The seat cushion is not deep enough and leaves a 4-5 inch gap between it and the back cushion.  The arm cushions are too short and cannot be snapped where indicated.  I will buy replacement cushions that are larger.,3
"Trend Lab Patchwork Elephant Stuffed Toy, Sherbet","This is the cutest little elephant.  Not plushy and soft but more like the old fashioned stuffed animals.  Bigger than I expected it would be, but so cute.",5
"The First Years Gumdrop Newborn Pacifiers, Pink/Purple, 5-Count","I got these because they look like a improved avent pacifier that my baby already loves.  Unfortunately my baby does not like these at all, but thats just her preference.  The nipple is identical to the avent, and base curves nicely with the contour of her face which would presumably help her keep it in her mouth easier.My only complaint is; to achieve the curve the base was molded with a rigid plastic piece inside of it.  My 2-month old likes to drop the pacifiers as she falls asleep and it usually ends up under her body somewhere, so I'll only let her sleep with the soft avents.",3
Crib &amp; Toddler Poly/Cotton Sheets - Color Light Blue - Flat,"I like that these sheets are fitted on the bottom, but flat at the top edge.  It is a nice fit on our toddler bed.  However, the material is not very soft.  It is rough and scratchy, even after several washes.",3
Magic Bumpers Portable Child Safety Bed Guard Rail 48 Inch - Set of Two,"So far, the bumpers have been working well. My child is able to climb over then when awake (to get up or go to the bathroom at night), and they are high enough at night so that my child does not fall out of bed.",5

The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"I have used this since my daughter was born, from her bassinet to her crib. She has been sleeping all night since she was 8 weeks old. She is now 15 months old and I still use it to put her to sleep and comfort her if she should wake up. It now sits on her dresser and I just use it from there.(she liked to mess with it too much as she got older). I have taken it with me on road trips and the sounds comfort her as if she was at home. I love this product and if I had to pick 5 of my favorites, it would be on top!Yeah, it eats batteries, I have to replace mine about every 3-4 weeks. But so what, she sleeps well and and goes to sleep on her own. And so what if the sounds are not perfect clarity, they work great as &quot;white noise&quot;. I have even put it on a few extra times to put myself to sleep listening through the baby monitor. :)",5
"Playtex TrainingTime Soft Spout Cup, 6 Ounce, 2 Pack, Color May Vary","These are great sippy cups in terms of delivering the liquid inside without fear of spillage.  My rommate and I recently purchased these to enjoy our liquor without dealing with the all too common problem of getting hammered and waking up the following day to discover a carpet saturated with Johnny Walker Black Label.  Not only has this problem been solved, but we also found great flow when actually drinking.  The only two problems with this model of sippy cup is the design does not allow for access to the last half an inch without cap removal and the cup does not refill itself.  The latter issue directly impacts end-of-night festivities in the event that no one is sober enough to execute booze refill operating procedures.  Despite these fairly minor drawbacks, these sippy cups are an all-around good buy, particularly due to the musical qualities, whose benefits can be reaped by removing the cap and sucking through it, generating quite a hilarious sound (particuarly while intoxicated).",3
Cloud B Twilight Ladybug - Pink,"My daughter, age 5, wanted one of the dream lights. I had seen these way before the Dream lights even came out & knew this would be a much better product. Not to mention that almost everywhere I checked for reviews on the Dream lights they were rated poorly. Cloud B & their products have very good ratings & now I know why. Very cute, light can be changed to 4 different colors, there is an off switch, and there are actual constellations projected on the ceiling. Love this product! would recommend to anyone, with or with out kids!",5

"Sunshine Kids Stow 'N Go Car Seatback Organizer, Black","Great back seat organizer,several handy pockets, mesh pocket material to see what's it's holding, large and roomy to cover and protect the whole back of the chair. The only thing that does not work out is the velcro top strap, made for a extra large/ wide headrest with wide metal posts, mine are narrow so the velcro straps run out of area to over lap and the top of the organizer sags down.",4

I do not have any other experience with baby tubs other than this one and i love love love it! the only thing i would want different is a draining hole on both sides instead of one side, but that is very minimal",5
"Dexbaby Nursery Organizer, White","i was skeptical that this product would be useful, but it's currently the most loved and used item in the house, given we're changing out newborn about 15x a day! it's bigger than i expected, but holds a ton of diapers, wipes, burp cloths, washcloths, you name it. we hung it on the wall next to our changing station and haven't had any issues with it yet. i would definitely recommend this product to anyone, especially if you have limited space. of all the products out there, i don't think there's anything comparable for the value. good luck!",5

"NUK Learner Cup BPA Free Silicone Spout, Single Pack, Colors May Vary","This sippy cup is great!  We have tried numerous brands/types and this is the one my 10 month old son finally drank out of.  The silicon spout is far better than the latex in terms of leakage, although the latex is a bit softer.  The double handles are great and don't make the cup too bulky like some other brands.  Note that colors may vary.  I purchased two and got one pink and one blue.  This doesn't bother me, but I am not particular about gender specific colors.",5
"RaZbaby RaZ-Pak Formula and Snack Container, Transparent Blue",I liked the idea If you have to go out for about an hour and just need to bring one bottle that you could use one of these containers for formula. However the tops don't screw on very easily and it's really quite annoying. Also when They are separated i don't like that you can't stack them because the tops are curved. Anyone that has a baby knows How much baby crap there is so having the ability to stack these would be a SpaceSaver!!,3
"Aden by aden + anais 3 Pack Muslin Little Bib, Life's A Hoot",As a mom of a chubby baby that has a neck you never see lol these were too small for my son when he was inky four months old. I kept them only cause I was too lazy to send back.,3
Munchkin Fresh Feeding Set,"I have spoons that are sharper than the blade on this thing. The only thing that worked in it is a banana, and I'm pretty sure I can manage that on my own.We used to have one that looked just like this when my siblings were babies, and it was great. We could grind up pretty much anything with it (chicken, steak, etc...) to share family meals. NO-CAN-DO with this model....Get what you pay for I guess.",1
Chicco Polly Highchair Woodstock,We bought this highchair when my daughter turned 5 months.  The assembly was easy and I found the perfect height in seconds.  Although it's not a very colorful chair I can't complain because my daughter loves it.I like how I don't have to unhook and rehook the entire 5-pt harness when getting my daughter in & out of this chair.  I can simply slip her arms through the shoulder belts and she stays secure after I easily clip in the middle buckles.The removable tray barely fits into our small dishwasher so I usually handwash it. We leave it opened since we use it every night and the wheels roll very smoothly.I paid $99.95 for this chair.  It's a great deal for such a wonderful chair.,5

"Inglesina 2010 Fast Table Chair, Ecru","Ordered this chair in ""Fiamma,"" (red) received ""Marina"" (dark blue)...and doublechecked my original order to be sure I had ordered Fiamma.  I actually prefer the Marina and didn't order it originally because it was a higher price, so all worked out in my favor.  However if you are set on a certain color, be prepared to communicate with Amazon!  First time I've ever received an incorrect product after many orders with them.As for the chair quality-we already have one that is 3 years old and has seen hard use.  It is still holding up great but we now have 2 kids and our oldest daughter has proven too wiggly for regular dining chairs.  My sister had one that is now over 10 years old and has been through 4+ kids!Chair itself is excellent quality, comfortable and easy to use.  The only flaws are fabric and the twist-on legs:  First, the fabric isn't easily wipeable.  The cover is fairly easy to remove but still takes effort-however it's very sturdy and holds up in a washer and dryer on regular cycles.  I wash it every couple of weeks though it should be done every few days with our 10 month old.  A soapy rag does the trick in between the big washings.  I haven't heard of any other chair that is as sturdy as Inglesina.  Second: the twist-on part of the legs (the black underpart you see in the pictures) is not as easy to grip as their prior design, which was easier to twist on and off a table.  However the pro of the newer design is that a kid can't get under the highchair and loosen it as my kid would happily do if she got the chance!Overall-4 stars.  A great value for the quality you receive with this product.",4
Baby Einstein 2-in-1 Safari Adventure Gym and Tunnel,It is a great toy! It is big and colorful and good quality. The baby loves it! The mesh of the tunnel is great.,5
"Cardinal Gates Stairway Special Gate, Black","This gate is terrific! It's the only one I could find that can go across top of stairs at an angle, which we needed. Beautifully designed. Installation and use are smooth, just as they should be. I ran up against a situation: First, be aware there is a difference between this model, made for top of stairs (Stairway Special Gate Model SS30), and another one (Auto-Lock Gate Model MG15)Cardinal Gates Auto-Lock Gate, White. At the time of this writing they were the same price on Amazon, though Stairway Special is supposed to cost more (see Cardinal website). The instructions were great BUT in my package, at least, there was one set in French and one in English, and the English ones were for the wrong model. If you can't read French you can type instructions into Google Translate. Be sure to translate everything though, because it's important to install correctly, especially at top of stairs.",5
"Leachco Podster Sling-Style Infant Seat Lounger, Sage Pin Dot","We learned of these when our two little guys started daycare.  I immediately knew we had to have them as both boys seemed so happy and content when sitting in them.  In addition to our bouncy seats, these are a great option for a nice, comfy (safe) place for them to sit somewhat propped up, which is especially helpful after they've just eaten and we don't want to lay them down flat right away.  The boys both love them....and so we!",5

Cheeky Monkey Pac Back,"I had high hopes for the Cheeky Monkey Pac Back. I knew that it would help getting through the airport by making one less thing that I would have to carry. I did not realize how much of a difference it would make. I got several looks walking though the airport from other parents that were carrying their car seats by hand.This item is worth every penny, is well made and fulfills every promise in its description. Loading and removing the car seat from the Pac Back is quick and simple. I am very happy with the purchase.",5
"Bumkins Flushable Diaper Liner, Neutral, 100 Pack","Such a great product for those who are grossed out or annoyed at having to deal with the contents of cloth diapers.  We use one in every diaper, and when we change it, all we have to do is flush it away!  This is a great price for 100 liners!",5
"Kiddopotamus Rayshade UV Protective Double Stroller Shade for Twin Strollers &amp; Joggers, Navy","Love the Sunshade.  For the most part works well, except if you are running in rather windy conditions, then, it just flies back and does not cover the kids so well.  I really use my double jog stroller for jogging and am happy to have the sunshade, the kids like it too.  The only other frustration is if you have a small child who is rather reclined in the stroller and the sun is close to setting, you may not get good coverage to keep the sun out of eyes unless you pull the shade completely over the stroller . . . then the older child isn't too happy because he/she can''t see out!",4

NUK Mash &amp; Serve Bowl,It works OK as a masher.  I'm not sure that it accomplishes more than what you could do with just a fork though.  I ended up not using it very much.,3
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"After a couple months of daily use I do like this booster but wish it wiped clean easier. I still think that the price was reasonable and the color is cheerful. I also like that it is lightweight making it easy to move from the main dining table out to the patio and back depending on the weather. Our daughter enjoys carrying it all by herself. So far it has been sturdy and no complaints about her comfort when sitting on it. However the trade off is that it takes a bit more to clean than I had initially assumed. A quick wipe with a damp paper towel was what I had in mind but that really does not get the job done. The spongy material always seems to cling to at least a few crumbs and the texture in seat, while good for preventing her from slipping out, also holds on to spill residue. That quick wipe with a paper towel is ok if the meal was not too messy or I am in a rush but after a messy meal I know I will need to give it a scrub with soap and water in the kitchen sink. I admit this could be a matter of my choice of cleaning solutions. I am reluctant to spray it with anything too harsh as I don't like to use them around the kids too much and am also not sure how that spongy material would hold up to stronger stuff.",3

"Summer Infant 2 Pack Microfleece Swaddleme, Blue","We swaddled my daughter for almost 4 months, until she got too long for these sleepers. We used a super swaddle which consisted of a receiving blanket tucked under her arms and then the swaddle me over that. That kept her snug and secure and warm all night long. She was not able to wake herself up either! If she did not have the super swaddle, she could easily escape the swaddleme. 4 months of heavy usage did leave a little ripping at the seams of the velro so watch for that. Happy Sleeping!",5

Safety 1st Bath Toy Bag,"If you think this thing will stick to the bathtub wall and stay there, forget it.  Maybe if it's empty, but that's no good.  And toys were forever getting tangled in it making my toddler mad.  Try something else.",2
"Tree by Kerri Lee Owl Clock, Pink","Love it. Very cute, handcrafted and original. Loved it out of the box. Always a good sign that it is a keeper",4
"Playtex TrainingTime Soft Spout Cup, 6 Ounce, 2 Pack, Color May Vary",Nothing special about these sippy cups very functional not a bad investment you may find some cheaper no real complaints,3
"green sprouts 0-6 Months Waterproof Absorbent Terry Print Bib, Girl, 5 Pack","I have a baby with reflux so she spits up A LOT! I bought a pack of these before I had her, and now that I get to use them I loved them so much I ordered another pack.  They are really soft and do a pretty good job of keeping her dry.  They are very absorbent given the amount of spit up she has after every feeding.",5
"Bright Starts Baby's Deluxe Play Place, Pink","I bought this mat for my daughter, not born yet, but I know that she will love it. I love the bright colors and the musical bird. I love the versatility as she grows. It was also very easy to wash and assemble. I definitely recommend this product!!!!!!",5
"Wee Gallery Wall Graphics, Jungle","The look is great, but the size is much smaller than I thought it would be. There is one large turtle  and the rest of the images are pretty small. It would have been nice to have all the turtles, sea horses and sting rays be the same size. Also the coral doesn't look as big as the picture. And the description is wrong. It says that there are two more turtles than what is actually in the package. There are no two six inch turtles in my package. I'm currently trying to get that resolved with the seller.Overall, it's still cute, but you'd almost have to buy two sets to make a standard size room look dynamic. Currently, I have it on just one wall which has the window on it. If I spread it out over all the walls in the room, it would look a little lack luster. My walls are painted a fun shade of blue and the comforter for my son's twin bed is the sea scape comforter from Ikea. Looks great together with these wall decals.",3
Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,"We had purchased the older model of the Mobi tykelight and it lasted for well over 2 years before it stopped charging well.  Our son LOVED it.  We ordered this newer model as well as a second one for our second child.  This is  complete junk.  I'm not sure why they changed the design but the charger is definitely not the quality of the older model.  For the part of this night light that is never handled by the kids,it has basically fallen apart on both charger bases.  Plus, as others stated, wiggle it a bit and the light flashes between the red and green lights so you can't tell if it's actually charging our not.  We usually find out that night when we pull it off the base and see that it's dim.  It seems as if it doesn't really make a good connection or maybe it's just not charging anymore.  Too hard to tell.  The old model had a base similar to the Oxo tooli lights.  Our night lights are already headed for the trash. As I stated, we're really disappointed since the older one was a great product.  We're looking for a replacement and I'm thinking we're going to try the Oxo tooli since that base looks like the Old model of Tykelight.  I know for sure I'm not throwing my money away on this again.  Another thing that I didn't like about this model versus the old is this is much brighter.  I preferred the dimmer light.  Way to bright to be in bed with the kids!  Oh, and I called customer service and it took them over a week to respond back to me.",1
"Prince Lionheart Medical Grade Silicone Bottles 3-Pack, 4oz","I'm absolutely not happy because the pack was supposed to have 3 bottles with different colour (white, gray & orange) But comes with 3 white bottle.I've bought 4 sets of these packs before from different retail all good, don't know why this one is all white!!!!",2
SheetWorld Fitted Pack N Play (Graco Square Playard) Sheet - Solid Sage Jersey Knit - Made In USA,"Great sheets at a great price! Great company also! Love them! They are super soft, wash up great, and they stay put! Highly recommend!",5
"Baby Trend Expedition Double Jogging Stroller, Skylar","I love this stroller!  It is the same stroller that One Step Ahead sells.  I was very bummed because One Step Ahead finally had it on sale for $220 and a free-shipping promotion.  We live in Hawaii and soon found that the promotion did not extend to us, of course- $189 to ship the stroller to Hawaii!!!  Well, went to Amazon.com, and was shocked to see that the stroller was cheaper at $189 and FREE Shipping (even to Hawaii).  I received it in two days!!!  Hawaii people love AMAZON.com!Okay, stroller benefits:  light, great for tall people, nice rubber handles that won't eventually start peeling off.  LOVE the adjustable canopy, we live in Hawaii and the sun is always out in some direction. No problems with our wheels, front wheel locks for running.  Very nice cup holder with two cups holders and a tray with a lid that shuts closed.  The basket underneath is seperated into two but it is still very large and can hold lots of stuff. VERY easy to put together!  It took me about 20 mins with a 2 year old jumping around me, probably could do it in about 10 mins.  Only need to put in about 7 screws total for the cup holder and the foot rest- everything else pops into place effortlessly. I also like that the seats are slightly wider than some of the other strollers so the kids are not so squishy.Cons:  The straps that hold your kids in place are thin and not padded and comfy like some of the more expensive strollers, but you can always buy padding for it.",5
"Graco Ipo Stroller, Spitfire","We like our Graco IPO for its compactness and simplicity in opening and stowing it away. The stroler also has bigger cargo room to allow you to bring more items.There is only one thing, it is not as lightweight as we expected. We compare it to our Graco travel system that we have, and I think they weight about the same.",4
Graco Prenatal Listener,"I've read the negative reviews for this product and the ""Danger"" warnings. I don't agree with them at all! Here's my 2-cents:I bought this product and saw the warning to ""wash your hands after using"" this device because of it being made from materials that ""may cause cancer or birth defects"".  That is a ""legal"" warning they must put on the box to protect the company. I've seen similar on other plastic products that I've used before quite safely. It sounds WAY more dire than it should, but doesn't everything when lawyers get involved? LOL  It does NOT mean that the moment you turn on this glorified stethoscope and place it on your tummy, it's going to somehow cause your unborn child to suddenly develop complications. It's a LISTENING device, which is no different than a stethoscope or those ear bud sound amplifiers you stick in your ear...within close proxity to your brain. There's no ""gamma rays"" or radiation or radio waves being broadcast into your womb. But if you're concerned, simply wash your hands and don't stick your fingers in your mouth before you do. Seriously, that's all you need do.The reality is this device is a very basic, battery-powered stethoscope recommended for use only during 3rd trimester because that's when the baby is big enough to make the kind of noise this device can pick up. It does work and is safe, but it's not a hospital-grade ultrasound. No gel required, but that means that you shouldn't expect what you will hear with this device to be of the same caliber as what you hear while at the OB/Gyn's office.I'm in my third trimester (27th week at the moment) and use this ""prenatal listener"" at home and while at work in an office setting. If the little one is sleeping, I don't hear much at all. But if the baby is very active, the pops and thumps are quite clear. Also, on rarer occasions I have heard the faint swoosh-swoosh-swoosh of his heart beat. It's rare because I must have the device positioned in just the right spot and the baby has to be turned just right for it to be clear.The thing I like most about this device is that with the two sets of ear buds, it has given my husband and I many chances to bond while listening to the soft sounds (thuds, thumps, and pops) our baby makes. It's not quite as beautiful as that moment when you first hear your child cry after delivery, but it's still worth treasuring the time together. And, yes, it was also quite funny to watch it bounce on my tummy when our little boy became a practicing gymnast in there! LOLLastly, I only paid $25 for this product, so anything above that (to me) would price gouging.",5
"Tadpoles Playmat Set, Modern/Multi",I got this mat for my 8 month old daughter because we have hardwood floors and it is amazing! It's so cute and easy to put together and also easy to take apart. I like it because I can wipe up spills and run a hand held vacuum over it and it's clean. They're easy to wash which is a plus. I am also surprised at how comfortable it is to sit on. A great mat!,5
Levana Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery and Talk to Baby Intercom,"the first thing is about the monitor quality is poor and the second thing is about the battery for it,I don't know should I use the recharger battery or normal battery.It doesn't say anything about that",3
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce",Very pleased with the product. No funny smell yet.  My daughter sometimes drops the bottle but no leaks yet. Using for more than a month now. Easy to clean.,5
Riley's Roses Pink and Sage Green Shabby Chic Floral Baby Girl Flower Bedding 9pc Crib Set by Sweet Jojo Designs,"Do not let the picture fool you.  This was the worst quality bedding I have ever seen!  As for the """"soft muted tones"""" forget it.  It looks like someone played color outside the lines and the pinks are not pink they are florescent.  One look even through the package and you can see how cheap the material is.  There is nothing soft about it.  The bumper would be completely useless if you are looking for it to stay up.  I would not let me worst enemy let alone my child sleep on this.  It is amazing what they can do with photography these days.  And as far as the return policy forget that to.  This company expects you to foot the bill to return it and they really do not care that they are selling low rate bedding.",1
"Gerber First Essential Silicone BPA Free Nipples, Medium Flow, 6 Pack","I don't know why but whenever I use these on my regular bottles sometimes they leak from the bottom of the nipple :/ Not very pleased, I usually really like Gerber products.",1
Cuisinart BFM-1000 Baby Food Maker and Bottle Warmer,"I knew I wanted to make my own baby food, so I got a mortar and pestle type contraption figuring I'd just steam the food and mush it up myself.  Well, I don't know if you've ever tried to mush up green beans like that, but it doesn't work.  So I threw them into my big Cuisinart and that didn't really get them fine enough either.  So now I had a pot, a steamer basket, a mortar and pestle and my Cuisinart all in the dishwasher just because I wanted to make some baby food -- not to mention this whole ordeal was going on an hour at this point.  I started to research specialized baby food makers and they all seemed terrible until I came across this one.  I will admit it, I was totally dubious about the need for something just to make baby food, but I found a good open box deal on Amazon's Warehouse site and went for it.  Well, I would buy this thing again at full price in a heartbeat.  You chop up some fruits or veggies, pour a little water in the back of the machine, hit steam and just go about your business.  It turns off when it's done.  Then, when you get a minute, just turn the dial to puree and it blends to a nice, smooth texture.  I've done yams, green beans, peaches, plums, peas, carrots, apples, and more in this thing and it has handled them all.  My baby gobbles up all the food I've made with this.  It holds about 4 cups when stuffed to the gills (and I do stuff it -- I've got a hungry baby!) so you can make batches to freeze.  And, the best part -- when you're done, just air it out and pop the bowl, lid and blades in the dishwasher.  So easy!  I recommend buying this right when your baby is starting solids so you get the most use out of it.  Truth be told, though -- I might take it to work once she's off baby food and use it to steam myself up a quick lunch!",5
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"This bed rail is easy to set up, is tall enough to keep my toddler from rolling out of her new ""big girl bed,"" and makes changing the sheets a breeze because of how easily it folds down flat.  However, we are using it on a really high antique bed (our bed-skirt is 18 inches).  Love it!",5
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","My daughter is 2 and half months, she loves looking at it, however the only problem is that the music it plays is not quiet loud. Even when we put it to the highest setting it is quiet low. Other than that great product to help encourage babies to play in the crib.",3
"Britax Roundabout 50 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I have a Roundabout in one car and this Roundabout 50 in the other car. I bought the Roundabout before the 50 came out, but I wish I had waited so I could have bought 2 of these. The 50 has 3 positions for the bottom belt. My son is in the 90th percentile, so having the option to move the belt a little forward is important. The belt on the Roundabout always leaves a mark on his leg, but it doesn't on the 50. If you're deciding between the two, pay a little extra for the 50!",5
"Peace of Mind Two 900 Mhz Baby Receivers, Monitor","Awful!!  I registered for this monitor and received it as a gift and after using it for about 3 months replaced it.  This monitor will scream out with static out of nowhere and scare you half to death while also waking up the baby 2 rooms away!!  The static is THAT loud!!!  Not to mention I don't really need to hear what my neighbors are talking about on the phone!  Worried me that others would hear what all we were saying!!  We picked that one because it had 2 receivers, however we replaced it with the Sony Baby Call monitor, MUCH MUCH better!!!!!!  Save yourself the hassle and go with Sony.",1
"Playtex Disney Playhouse Insulator Cup, 9 Ounce, Colors and Styles May Vary","We love these cups! It keeps the drinks cool and really is spill proof.  My daughter loves Mickey, so she is thrilled with the cup as well.",5

Evenflo Comfort Select Milk Storage Bottles,Bought these for milk storage after pumping from my Medela Pump in Style.  They work great; I only wish I would have bought more!,5
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,My son's mucus still bothers him.  The nose sucker didn't get the DEEP stuff like I thought it was.  Just as effective as a bulb.,1
"OXO Tot 4-Piece Feeding Set, Green","I LOVE the fact that the bowl has an air-tight lid and it's pretty deep so it's great for cereal. That being said, it has definitely started scratching and staining. I guess I should have know better then to served tomato sauce in it! My son never really made use of the plate. I think mostly because the detachable ring that is meant to make it easier to scoop food always comes off. Plus it's kind of annoying not to be able to cut food in the same plate you are serving it in, since it scratches so easily. But that's just me.The fork is awesome and has proven to be one of the easiest for my son to use. It's not sharp at all so I'm never nervous of him getting jabbed in the mouth. The spoon is pretty shallow and was great when he was younger (around 1 year) but isn't practical anymore.I plan to buy a few more forks if they are available to purchase separately.",3
Best BIB for Baby - Soft Bib (Pink-Elephant),"Great 5-Star Product but An Obvious knock-off of the Original McPolo's BabySoft BibThis brave seller doesn't seem to care if he is violating any copyrights or infringing on any trademark and patent protections. He is not even weary about offering a knock-off product of the highly acclaimed McPolo's BabySoft Bib, a quality product at Amazon most parents are aware of. Not only that, he just casually &#34;drives through all the red lights&#34; so to speak and &#34;borrows&#34; their product images puts on his own logo and calls them his own! Sorry it is what it is, this is stealing under broad daylight! More to that, the language he uses to describe the product is also just too obvious a copy from the originator's version, as if he does not have any imagination, enthusiasm or beliefs pushing his knock-off product, but just wants sales, sales and more sales. One more thing that I cannot swallow, and it is the final nail to the coffin: He even brave enough to &#34;borrows&#34; McPolo's customers' product reviews next door on Amazon, word-for-word and fabricates the entire customer reviews entries!! I give him a 5-star for his guts!! But I cannot stomach and condone blatant business misconduct in such a way under Amazon's nose. I wonder why they don't take actions against this seller, to be honest. Sorry, I will not buy this product at any price. Fair competition is ok, but this is just too much, too much in-your-face, unethical and it is totally un-American.",1
"Boon Glo Nightlight with Portable Balls,White",It's smaller than it looks like on line. And the balls are made of a cheap plastic. Still pretty neat.,3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I received a really nice gift pack of Avent bottles at one of my baby showers.  The quality of the bottles is great, but they don't work for everyone.  The leaked horribly.  When I say leak, the milk didn't come pouring out of the rim or anything, but the nipples are an odd shape that can be difficult for some infants to master, causing the milk to run all over their face and clothes.  My husband got so frustrated with the amount of milk running down our 2 month old's face that the threw most of the in the trash.  I gave the remaining bottles to a friend who is having the same problems with her 3 month old.  I wouldn't waste the money on these - the Evenflo Ultra's are better",2
Boken Every Day Diaper Bag in Black,"We got this as our 2nd bag to use for traveling and going to the beach & park with, as our &#34;nice&#34; diaper bag we had kept getting dirty and sandy and was a complete pain to keep cleaning.  We were happy to find this bag as advertised - unisex, extremely lightweight and easy to clean with a baby wipe!  I especially love the convertible straps.  I use the tote straps mostly, but love having the backpack option when things get hectic!  The backpack straps aren't the most padded, but haven't been uncomfortable even when wearing it that way for a couple hours, and that's a trade I'm willing to make with it being convertible and light! My husband likes the long messenger strap.  He hated carrying our other bag like a tote (not to mention it looked like a purse!).There are 3 handy zip pockets for small/personal items and I love the big mesh pocket on the side for my big water bottle or coffee thermos and the flap pocket on the other side is perfect for my son's sippy cup.",5
"Britax Parkway SGL Belt-Positioning Booster Seat, Cub Pink","This booster seat will last a very long time. If you are researching alternatives, don't waste your time. This is the best booster seat at this price.",5
Infant Bucket Seat Liner Color: Pink,"The ""Cool Mee"" doesn't seem to keep my daughter that cool. Her back is still a little damp when I get her out of the carseat. I bought it for those sticky, 90 degree days we had in the summer. I always have to adjust the liner in the carseat as it tends to move around and not stay in place.The only thing that this product has done for us is wash really nice and make her carseat look more girly.",2
Blue Shark Funny Cool Cute Baby Bibs - Best for Use with Girl or Boy Infants and Babies - Waterproof Washable Silicone Plastic-Your Baby Will Love These Silly Animal Face Bibs-Silicone Baby Bib with Crumb Catcher,"Great bib overall, cute and fun design. It cleans very easily, never smells, dishwasher safe too. Easily rolls up for travel. I like how the bottom lip sticks out enough to catch the crumbs better than other pouch bibs. I have owned several of these. My only complaint is that the neck loop, though adjustable to two sizes, is still a bit too big for smaller (younger) babies. The kids' collars still get messy (but their laps stay clean!). When I serve messy food like spaghetti, I put an over-the-head towel bib on first to protect the kids' collar and shoulders, then this bib over the top to catch everything else. If it was just a bit wider and sat up higher on the child (smaller neck loop or maybe a third hole adjustment?), it would be perfect! I still love these though and have given several as gifts as well as use them for my own kids.",4
"Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake Wall Frame, White",I loved this keepsake frame kit.  The first one I received as a present was not usable b/c the clay that came with it was already hard and not pliable.  I had to exchange it for another kit.  There should be some sort of date on the box to check for product freshness.,4
Animals Alphabet Baby Nursery Peel &amp; Stick Wall Art Sticker Decals for Boys and Girls,"Very cute decals. Some letters are curling at the edges so I'm not sure how long they will last.  I might try using a little glue.  My 3 yr old loves to list off the animals.  However, it took my husband a little time researching to figure out the animal for letter I is an Ibex.  Overall these are very cute.",4
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","It works.It's a baby carrier.My baby was comfortable, I was comfortable.Only used a few times, probably should have used it more.Waste of money, don't buy it.",5
"Bummis Tots Bots Easy Fit Diaper, Starburst, 8-35 Pounds",I have found that the Bummis Tots Easy Fits are the only diaper I can use on my Heavy Sleeper (12 hours) that will not leak.  The PUL is thick and I have never had any wicking or wetness come through on her bedtime clothing.  I wash the one I own every night and reuse it.  I have the mushroom magic diaper print which is oh so cute on her little bum.,5
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Burpy Bib, Butterfly Patch",These are the only burpees I use as they absorb so much spit up very quickly and they are super soft. They are nice and big so they cover a lot of your shoulder. The snaps to convert it into a bib are farther apart so his neck can grow into it as a bib. I will be using this for a long time to come.,5
Graco Lovin' Hug Open Top Swing in Clara,I have 8 children ranging from 24yrs -4 weeks. I have had the old hand crank swings right down the line. I am so happy with this product. It has everything I have ever wished for in a swing. I love that it plugs in the laying position is great for a young baby the mobile does not get in the way. Also the swing was not hard to put together according to my husband. I would buy this item again.,5
"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","These are the best bottles. When I used to brestfeed my baby and  he would get a lot of gas, it has never happened with these bottles. No air bubbles gets in and had not probles with the transition from breast to bottle. Read the instructions and you will not have problems with leaks. It takes more time to clean them, but they are worth it.",5
Ecobubs Wool-Blend Diapers From New Zealand - Ruby/Cream Medium 11-25lbs,"We have tried a lot of different diapers over the past 3+ years and Ecobubs are definitely some of the best out there!  They are super absorbent and, in our experience, virtually leak-proof.  They have a very comfy fleece inside and a wool outside (not scratchy wool...nice and fluffy wool).  In between those layers is a waterproof material that keeps liquids where they belong!  Ecobubs are also very durable and last wash after wash.Did I mention they are ridiculously cute too?",5
Piyo Piyo Yellow Baby Nail Scissors,Just what my daughter-in-law needed to trim those teeny little nails of my new granddaughter!  I will purchase another for my daughter now.,5
"Evenflo Tribute Sport Convertible Car Seat, Willa",The car seat is good. I was kinda disappointed.i ordered 2 one pink and one red for my twins. (Boy and girl) I ordered these cause I wanted ones with drink holders. My son's had one and my daughters didn't. The speed was good it didn't take to long to receive them.,2
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black",This is the best sun-shade on the market! Super easy to put up and it hasn't come off yet! It's also not tacky like some that you see.My only complaint is that it has some creases from where it had been folded up previously.,5
Billy Bob Baby T-Rex Pacifier,My nephew loves his new pacifier.  He looks so cute with it on.  It's super funny and gets a lot of compliments.,5

"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado","This is our second Planet Wise pail liner. The first has been through over 300 hot, extended washes, numerous dry cycles on ""high"" (we try to air dry it, but that isn't always possible"", months of international travel in suitcases, tropical rural settings, etc. It made it through our first child (2 years of exclusive cloth diapering) and 9 months of the second. It still works, but has developed little cracks in the coating, and I figured better to replace it before it starts to leak. I can highly recommend this bag, especially with the generic ""cloth diaper"" pail with hinged lid. No smell, no mess, no trash, and cheap.",5
"Safety 1st Prograde Toilet Lock, White and Silver - 1 Pack",Very difficult to install. I do not recommend. There are better products for protection. I did not like. Not all used. very bad purchase.,1
"Bummis Bio-Soft Liner, Small","These liners make cloth diapering so much easier. My daughter is 6 months old, and we've been cloth diapering for about 3 months now. These liners are pretty good about catching the poo and saving me from having to spray for 10 minutes to get the solids off. They flush easily for us, but we do live in a newer place. I usually throw it in the toilet, and let it sit (as per the directions) until we either have another to add or we use the toilet ourselves, but I have just flushed them straight down with no issue.These are also amazing for rash ointment, since most will cause water to repel if it gets onto the diaper.",4

2 Fenzer Rechargeable Baby Monitor Batteries for Graco 2791 2795,"After 18 months, our baby monitors wouldn't last through the night. Now that we've replaced the original batteries with these, they make it through the night and longer.",5
Travel Potty Chair,"This little potty is a great idea. It takes up very little space. I kind of hate sending those bags to the landfill, but it's better than going in a nasty crab-crawling public bathroom, where your 3 year old is trying to put their hands on the gross seat to keep from falling in, and then asking questions about the condom machine.I wish the back was covered in the folded position, but I guess that would add weight to it.Excellent item.A woman with a skinny butt can use it, too, but I wouldn't know personally about that. :)",5
Philips AVENT Express Food and Bottle Warmer,"We got this to warm my sons bottles while I am at work. We didn't like it at all. It took 4 tries to warm the refrigerated bottle to lukewarm, which he didn't like. There seems to be no point to the setting 1, so why have it on there at all? We also didn't like the idea that it had no automatic off, since I have a 3 year old at home, I can't always run to the warmer immediately when it's done. It also needed an audible alert to a warm bottle. Again, I don't have time to babysit it. We returned it immediately, and I am looking for the old style avent warmer, which worked perfectly, I don't know why they ever changed it.",1
Gerber Flexi-head Bottle Brush and Nipple Cleaner,Excelent Brush for Gerber Bottles. Clean the hole bottle in 1 round. The bottom clean the nipples very good but you need to take out and put it inside out,5

"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",Purchased this gate since my dogs like to jump over my current one. I love it since it has a door on it.Pros:  MetalEasy to useDoor lock is a slide and lift so dogs cannot unlock itCons: annoying to set up 4 little nobs that you have to place just right against the wall so you can actually close the gate,5
Kids Line Willow Organic 4-Piece Crib Set,I saw this bedding originally at burlington coat factory but it much more expensive.  I fell in love with it there and went on amazon and was overjoyed to find it on here for a much more affordable price!  The colors are just great and true to the picture.  They are calming and can be used for either a boy or a girl!  The quality of the product was great.  Our crib is set up with the bedding and awaiting our new arrival...I can't wait to add more from this set to her room :),5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Blue Sky Cradle 'n Swing,"Very nice swing. Our baby loved being rocked both ways. I loved the volume control for the music, and the comfort of the padding. Very sturdy base and we love that it plugged into the wall, and didn't just run on batteries. Would buy it again! Loved it!",4

Two weeks before our baby's arrival as I was hand washing (yes, hand washing as none of the material comes off to put in the washer machine) I finally put in the batteries to the night light, music etc and to my surprise none of the electronics work. Will not be returning due to not enough time before our little one arrives. Word to the wise check the electronics as soon as possible. Not too happy that I will not be able to take advantage of these features.",3
Munchkin Cleaning Brush Set,These are a must have for cleaning out those kid cups and all the small parts related to children's drinkware.  An all-in-one size tool will not work for many as it is not long enough to get where it needs to go.,5

BRICA Stretch-to-Fit Window Sun Shade,"It's really not bad. It does what they say= stretches here and there. The problem is, however, that it looks kind of clumsy. Might be my fault for being so picky. I don't like the stretchy sides as much as I thought that I would.",3
"Peg Perego Convertible Infant to Toddler Car Seat, Black","this was our first carseat so money wasn't an object. it is of excellent quality, safety, style & comfort. i don't recommendit for small cars but fits perfectly in our SUV & we love the chic style. i highly recommend it!",5
"Chicco 360 Hook on High Chair, Midori","UPDATE 12/3/12: After four months of daily use and two months of weekly dish washing, the metal components have started to rust. This product is great for traveling to Nana's house, but it just does not make the grade as full-time baby gear. I have downgraded my rating on this item from 4 stars to 2 stars. We have finally had enough of this highchair and chose the Antilop from IKEA as our replacement.ORIGINAL REVIEW 9/19/12: We have been pleased with the Chicco 360 Degree Rotating Hook On Chair, with the exception of keeping it clean. The chair easily and securely attaches to the table without taking up any floor space. The compact size of the clip-on chair is convenient for our small dinette, going out to eat, or traveling. The rimmed tray keeps our son's food within easy reach, except for what he drops on the floor. I can spin him around to face the kitchen and he enjoys watching me cook. But since this seat has both stationary and moveable components, bits of food get stuck between the two. We have to take it completely apart every week to keep it clean.For picture and more details, I wrote about our experience with the Chicco rotating high chair on the blog ""How to Feed a Henry"".",2

Chewy Tubes Knobby Super Chew Red,"I didn't buy this for my little teething toddler but she quickly stole it from her sister and wouldn't give it back for the whole week she was teething.  The child I bought it for unfortunately won't chew on it.  I was hoping since she has been chewing on her own fingers that this would be a good replacement but I'm guessing she doesn't like the bumps (she has sensory issues).  She has also stopped chewing on her P and Q so I'm not sure what to think.  I still like all three products for chewing though.  The P and Q can squeak a little which was a good motivation for my child but she just doesn't like chewing in general, especially food.  I was hoping to get her to chew on this instead of her finger and them start dipping it in food to get her used to the idea of chewing on food.  Oh well.  It is a good size so it may be a bit big for an infant chew toy but like I said, my toddler loved it.  Very easy to wash and seems indestructible for a child.",5
"Adiri BPA Free Natural Nurser Ultimate Bottle Stage 2 Blue, Med Flow (3-6 months)",most different type of bottle i have come across and i have bought many.  i had two children who would not take a bottle and this is the closest i have seen to the breast.  my daughter did take it better then any other I have tried.,4

"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","First of all this bassinette is a pain to get through standard doorways and ours is a relatively new house. You have to angle it going through a doorway. Also its rocking legs get in the way. It's hard not to stumble on them. The changing table is a pain to use. You have to remove the bed to get to it. The bed is not secured by anything. Don't raise the frame to the highest setting or it will tip over if the wheels are not locked in place. The ""mattress"" is very thin and needs extra padding if you want your baby to be comfy in it. We had to add lots of extra padding in ours in order not to feel the hard split board in the bottom. You can't find extra mattress covers that will work unless you get rid of that terrible belt that is part of the pad. We got rid of that in ours. The music/vibrator/light did not work at first so we kept fiddling with the battery pack and eventually got it working but that took longer than the actual assemble of the bassinette. Also the hood would not stay propped up on its own either.We saw many at Babies-r-Us, where we bought it, that the boxes looked like they were previously opened. We bought one that had no signs of tampering. Thankfully all the parts were there but we should have realised why there so many previously opened boxes.It may look nice but ""don't judge something by how it looks"".Avoid buying this thing. We've seen better bassinettes out there after seeing this thing's faults. Too bad its too late to return this awful bassinette.",1
"Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, Green/Blue","Much better than a high chair.  The tray has several different positions, so it can be set up very close to the child, meaning less food in the lap.  It also doesn't have little cracks or creases that are hard to clean.  It's rounded & smooth, so it's easy to wipe off.  The one thing I wish it had is a cup holder--it's easy for drinks to get knocked down from the tray.",4
Joovy Dry and Snug Rain/Wind Shield Cover,"I live in a big city and use my Joovy Caboose every day.  With this wind/rain shield, it is a year-round stroller.  The shield is thick - it will not crack or tear, and the rain just pools on top, never leaking through.  We've used it in the rain many times, and the kids have never gotten wet, except for in a really heavy downpour when their shoes get wet.  Unfortunately, there is no way to help this, since understandably it cannot cover all the way down, as it would then cover the wheels.  The shield does not cover the organizer, and so things in that may get wet in the rain.  I also use the shield in cold weather, and it does great to keep the kids warm.  It's like a little greenhouse inside, so be careful that the kids don't get too hot if they are bundled warmly.One of the best features of the shield is that there is a zipper about 6 inches long on the side of the front where you can pass things through to the front child.  This is great for handing snacks or a water bottle through without taking the shield off or reaching up underneath it.  There are also little holes for air vents on each side.  It attaches with 3 squares of velcro on each side in the back and with strips of velcro by the front tires (I don't attach the front unless it is really windy out).  The back child can just undo one side and come out of the stroller easily without taking the whole thing off.One con is that it is very difficult to hear the kids through the shield, so pay extra attention that they are not in there yelling and you just aren't hearing it!Overall, this is a wonderful product.  This makes it very feasible to use the Joovy Caboose year-round and still have the kids be comfortable.",5

Kiddyloo Toilet Seat Reducer (Blue/Green) - Toddler Potty Training Seat,"The overall idea is a great one but the seat is SO small that when my son sits on it his boy parts stock right over the edge, he is a small three yeR old and I figured that maybe some of the reviewers had larger children but i am really disappointed because this seat is pretty much useless unless I want to clean urine off the floors and walls (no thank you) this seat may work for a girl but definitely not for boys :(",2
"Dream On Me 3&quot; Extra Firm Portable Crib Mattress, White",Just what I wanted,5
UppaBaby Mesa Carseat (Jake),"I waited a while to write this review because I wanted to give this car seat a chance before passing judgment. I have officially been using it for 10 wks now and here is what I think.... I bought this car seat because of its safety features, simplicity of use, and sleek appearance. Some of the PROs with this seat are the look and ease to install and the ease of adjusting the straps but the CONs out weigh the PROS. Some of my cons with this seat are the sunshade does not provide enough coverage and has trouble staying open, it stains when it gets wet (you can wash it which I did however it is a pain), The &#34;one hand release&#34; from the stroller is not really &#34;one handed&#34; because the button is so difficult to push down ( and I am 5'11'' 170 lbs I am not weak...). My daughter was 7lbs when we brought her home from the hospital and this seat was not comfortable for her at all no matter how we adjusted it. Now that she is 11lbs she fits much better and is more comfortable. The advertised spots to place the buckles that are supposed to keep them from getting hot and hold them out of the way are useless at this size because the straps are shorter and don't reach the slots. I see how once she is bigger and we have to let out the harness they will fit but they don't work right now.All of that I could live with the WORST part is (PLEASE READ!!!) I recently put the seat on the base in my car and for whatever reason I decided to rock the seat side to side to make sure it was clipped into the base and to my surprise it WASNT! Only one  side of the seat was latching into the base. So I pulled the seat out (took baby out) and turned it over. One of the silver latches that hook into the base was stuck up in the seat and wouldn't come out! I called Uppababy right away and the customer service was good They stated they would send me another seat. However it is 7 days later and no seat yet. Although they were helpful they are not quick.Overall, if I would have able to &#34;test drive&#34; this seat before buying I probably would not have spent the money.",2
"UPPAbaby G-Luxe Stroller, Jake/Black","I've had this stroller for a couple of months now, and I love it. I truly think that moving from the full sized stroller that went with my infant travel system to the GLuxe has improved my quality of life! I wish I had done it sooner. My very tall, 30-lb 19-month old son is quite comfortable in it and looks like he will continue to be for some time. My only size concern is the waist straps-we don't have much room to enlarge them, so it may not be the best choice of stroller for a more rotund child. The operation of opening and closing the stroller only took a little practice to master, and now I find it very smooth and easy to operate. I love how light it is. The carry strap was an important feature for me. Recently, i was in a mall with my son and the elevator was broken. I was able to take him out of the stroller, fold it, put it on my shoulder with the strap, and carry it and him down the escalator with no trouble. The standing while folded feature is also great. Some people have complained that it's not terribly sturdy in this position. For my purposes, I think its fine. I'm able to fold it and stand it next to my table at a restaurant and have it be out of the way but in sight. (I don't want to leave a nearly $200 stroller hanging out in the lobby...) Folded, it takes up very little room in my little trunk, so i can actually store things other than the stroller in there for the first time in more than a year and a half. (old stroller took up the entire trunk) The sun shade is nice and generously sized, and the basket underneath is convenient for small shopping bags or folded coats. Don't plan on stowing large bags down there, but it's handy for small things. The stroller handles like a dream. It's extremely smooth to operate, and you can easily steer it one-handed. My 6'4 husband is comfortable pushing it. My son loves pushing it around, too.  :) Before purchasing, I did weeks of research, read tons of reviews, and vacillated between this and the Maclaren Triumph. I probably would have been happy with the Maclaren, too, but now that i have the GLuxe I think I made a great decision.",5

"Thinkbaby Trainer Cup, Orange, 9 Ounce",I rarely write reviews on Amazon unless the product is truly something. My son hates sippy cups.

"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Five stars for the price and ease of installation. With a baby in the house now, and 2 pets, we needed a solution to block off the hall to keep the baby from getting to the back of the house and out of the pets food dishes. This gate extends to fit the width of the hallway and secures with pressure against the walls without damaging the paint. No screws needed for my application, but it does come with cups and screws if needed to secure to a surface (top of staircase etc) where very secure mounting is required.",5
"Natursutten BPA-Free Natural Rubber Pacifier, Orthodontic, 0-6 Months","Loved the idea of all natural rubber but my son hated this orthodontic paci.

"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","Amazing!  Don't know how I went so long without this!  This stroller, while not the ""trendiest"" looking (I'm talking to you Bugaboo and Quinny), is amazing.  Definitely made for use and build to last.  I've just picked up jogging again now that my son is about to turn two.  I hesitated buying this at first, thinking that you had to be a hard-core runner to really make use of this.  But after getting this, and seeing how easy it is to fold and use, i wish I would have bought this sooner  The ride is incredible. The redesigned seat interior is great, easy to clean.  Incredibly easy to fold down and open.  Also even though it's big (and I have the SE, which has the bigger tires unlike the CE which is a bit smaller), the wheels come off with two quick latch pops.  Much easier to get in and out of the trunk of my car.The canopy is super, great shade, huge and retractable to two positions.  Love the large peek a boo window and that you can create an airvent in the back by opening the back panel.Color is plum and gray, true to what is pictured on amazon's site, very muted and understated.My son loves riding in it. One of the redesigns with 2011 models and up is the infinite recline, which allows you to recline the seat in any angle instead of the previous two positions.  I like this feature but we don't really use it because my son is old enough now to want to sit up and stay awake all the time during stroller rides (instead of napping).Only negative I have seen so far is that the seat doesn't sit as ""upright"" as I might like- straight up is still inclined and that is taking a little getting used to for my son.I have not purchased the handlebar console or the snack tray adapters or anything.  Haven't really needed it since the basket is so huge and can hold everything for me, even my diaper bag.Amazon definitely had the best price on this as well.",5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","This is a great idea but they don't stick to the toilet. As soon as I sit my daughter on the seat, the cover pulls off. It's easier (and cheaper) just to put toilet paper on the seat.",1

SO glad I never got rid of this gem (have passed on some potty seats in the past), and I will hang onto it for grand kids....small, compact folded up, easy to use in a vehicle or small space if necessary.. Easy to take along... Super!",5
Prince Lionheart Compact Seatsaver,"Must have buy for parents with car seats.  When my son was first born, I didn't know anything about seat savers and I had his car seat directly on my seats.  When I pulled everything out to clean in a few months, I noticed deep lines in the seats where the leather was stretched.  I immediately bought this seatsaver and I am happy with my purchase.  I think it might actually save my seats when/if I ever get these car seats out of my car! I have one now for my son's booster seat and my daughters car seat.",5
Graco Nasal Clear Nasal Aspirator,"This product is fantastic! It is not super duper strong, but from all that I've learned that is a very good thing. I worked in a Children's Hospital and had to have extensive training for the really strong, super duper suction there. I found this aspirator to be wonderful as long as it was used with sufficient saline. If my daughter's nose was too dry, nothing would happen. We have used this on many a night during her nasty colds. I cannot imagine how we would have survived without it. I've tried the bulb aspirators and they just don't cut it. Plus, after a few tries, my daughter wouldn't let me near her with the bulb. I recommended it to all of my friends who are having babies. One tidbit of advice, though...don't lose the rubber ring in the head! They don't sell replacements and once it's gone, it doesn't suck at all. Just take extra care when washing because it falls out easily.",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I was concerned when I first removed it from the box that it wasn't going to fit when I just held it up to myself (my breasts are set widely apart), but when I actually tried it on, it fits just fine.

"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","I have a very active toddler and lever handles on all my doors - not a great combination.  I love this door lock because it is so fast to attach and remove from the door, it is easily height adjustable, it is easy for all my other kids to open and close, and so far it seems to be holding up to my toddler's strength.  I even packed it for a recent vacation - just in case I needed to keep the baby out of a room.  I wish I had bought two of these!",5
"Lollacup Infant And Toddler Straw Cup, 2 Pack - Blue/Black",The weight straw is great and attaching the handles via the bottom is fantastic. Easy to clean. Cute. When my daughter first started using it I loved it. Now she's into throwing it when she's done. After one throw it's now difficult (I'd say impossible but sometimes I can do it) thread it properly but as soon as she tosses it I have to take the top off and re-screw it on. If I don't it leaks. So if I haven't noticed she's dropped it or thrown it then I have a mess on my hands. She can't pull the straw out so try try again. It also doesn't like until then so that's nice for travel and before use.,3
"Sassy Grow Up Cup , Blue/Green, 7 Ounce, 2-Count","I tried these cups for my 18 month old boys who usually drink from straw sippy cups, but are lately obsessed with drinking out of a regular cup like big boys.  These cups were impossible to drink from as you have to actually suck on the rim of the cup.  We ended up using them as regular cups without the lid, which doesn't help prevent any spills.",2
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"I am in love with this blanket. It's so cute. Great quality.very nice size. Everything that I wanted! I was looking at different blankets, read a lot of review, and I am so happy that I picked this one. I got one in blue color with round circles. Just beauty. Very comfortable to care on.  Doesn't take a lot of space in a back of my car. I would recommend it to anybody. Thank you for the great product. .",5
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Activity Gym,"we purchased this item at the beginning of January. we washed all the pieces that could be washed prior to use with no issue. the colors are attractive to our 4 month old without being over stimulating or offensive to our home decor. she loves the little owl best, but all the little animals are fun and well constructed. the tummy time pillow is firm enough and fits perfectly. the mat itself has just enough going on, with crinkle leaves and squeaker flowers. the hang tabs are sewn tough as we're always moving everything around. we are very pleased with the mat and so is baby! I would add only a few optional rings for reach and maybe Velcro to help keep it closed when not in use.",5

"Baby Jogger 2011 City Mini Double Stroller, Black/Black","I had a Chicco Cortina for a year and a half, and just bought this stroller. I was lucky to find a used one on Craigslist for $200. It was worth every penny and more. Now that I have it, I can honestly say it is worth twice the price. I may not have fully appreciated it if I hadn't lugged around that huge beast of a stroller for so long. This one is lightweight and easily fits into the trunk of a sedan-- eg an Audi A4, or a Volvo sedan. Both have notoriously tight trunks, and this stroller fits easily into either, with room for a diaper bag and even a few bags of groceries. It folds down to a height of about 10"" tall, for real! It is a simple and quick, one move maneuver to get it folded down flat. You just yank on the straps in the middle and pull up. It doesn't require a lot of strength because this stroller is so light compared to other tandems. To open it, I can use just one hand and lift up on the handle bar-- while holding a 31lb toddler in the other! The weight limitation is 50 lbs per child, so we will grow into this one for quite some time. I hope it will be the last double stroller we will need. I took my kids to the San Diego Zoo the other day, by myself, using this stroller, and it was a breeze. (Big, huge, hilly zoo with lots of trekking for me, and kids getting in and out of the stroller, then having to pack up the car at the end of the day while tired!) Finally, the quality is really exceptional, which also justifies the higher price. There is nothing flimsy about this stroller. My one and only complaint is that the bottom basket is small and it's really hard to get things in and out of there while the kids are sitting in their seats. But, there are several other storage pockets for keeping things like diapers, sippies, wipes and snacks handy and contained.I love love love love this stroller.",5

"Safety 1st Summit Car Seat, Victorian Lace","Love this carseat, the colors are just right, not too bright and not too dark. If a spill happens its not noticeable. My daughter is a little over two and she fits perfect in it.... Prenty of room to grow. My 4year old fits perfect in it also. I Love the recline on this seat, I leave it in that position as we are in the car a lot and my daughter passes out in her seat and her head doesn't flop forward. The padding is very nice, its soooo soft. The armrest are nice too. the only thing I don't like is the cup holder is too low, and when the seat is reclined my daughters sippy cup tips right out.... Great carseat overall. would deffently recommend and buy again.",5

Medela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump with On the Go Tote,"This product is certainly not an adequate pump for working moms that need a realistic supply at home.  Maybe for someone who just wants to have an occasional backup option, but not for regular use.  After failing with the pump in style, my wife and I just rented a Medela Symphony pump and what a difference!  The symphony is soooo much better, and the cost of renting it for 5 months is equal to the purchase price of the pump in style.I give this product one star because we paid almost $300 and it is a crappy pump.  Way overpriced.  If you are going to be a working mom then just rent the symphony and save yourself from what we went through.UPDATE - I called Medela customer service and got them to let me mail the pump to them to exchange it for a brand new pump with seals on it.  I figure I will sell the new one and make my money back towards the rental of a second symphony.  That way the wife can have one pump at home and one at work.",1

I was a litle worried that it might not be well paint and look kind of cheap, it doesnt at all.  It looks like a painting with a growth chart on the edge. It would enhance any nursery, I am so happy with it. I am going to hang it on the wall and then take it down when we want to measure her.  It is adorable!",5

"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Galaxy Grey",I bought this to carry our daughter in instead of using the stroller. I even got the waist extention sine the reviews said that men may need it since the belt was small.  Well we tried it and it is really had for one person to put a baby in. Also we had a hard time fitting her in it and once she was on my husbands back he hated it.  I think it's a great idea but either we need to work on how to use it or it just isn't for us. Also it's kinda pricey for all our problems.,3
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","After being a tried and true Britax user for my first two children, I did a TON of research when it came to baby #3 and am SO happy with my Radian RXT. First, I was most impressed when installing the Radian RXT in my car {2008 Honda Accord}. I was able, for the first time, to use the latch system which I know is the safest way to install a carseat. I have installed other seats that also use latch but this was so much easier with everything already included and attached right to the carseat. I also found it really easy to ""un-latch"" when I decided to move the carseat from one side to the other in the backseat. The seat itself looks sharp. I love how it grows with my son (he's a pretty tall little guy). He loves his new seat, and actually feel asleep the very first time we put him in it, so it's got to be pretty comfortable, too! He also loves the cupholder! Having a sedan, sometimes there are three people (usually kids) in the backseat. The Radian RXT is much narrower and lower than our old Britax as well (no more bonking his head when getting him buckled in). It just feels like a safer seat - so much stronger than previous seats we've had. When I was showing it off to a firefighter-friend of ours (to double-check my installation) he also commented on the safety of the carseat. I also really like the weight limits for this carseat. I wish I would've had it when my son was under a year, so he could've remained backward-facing for so much longer, which is now recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. This will be the last carseat/booster that I will use with my son and I could not be more pleased, I just wish I would've had it a lot sooner so I could've used it from the time he was much smaller.",5
"Simple Wishes D Lite Hands Free Breastpump Bra, Soft Pink, Large to Plus Size",Waited until the baby was 9 weeks old to order this & I don't know why!  Its awesome!  Im a size that I thought could go with either S-XL or L-plus. I ordered the S-XL first but the cut outs were too close together so I had to return it. Ordered the L-Plus and it's perfect. It's so adjustable they I can make it tight enough. Only wish it came with a zip in panel like my coworkers did.,5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I was larger breasted before I had my first son. Unfortunately, getting up to a size 42L after his delivery, I was doubtful that I would be able to find any nursing bras or pumping bras that would fit.  I was especially skeptical that this product could cover the broad range of sizes it listed (L-XXL).  I decided to chance it because I thought I was going back to work and running out of time to find anything.  When I received it, I was pleasantly surprised that even without the extra zipper extender, it fit! Honestly, because I did not end up going back to work, I do not use it a lot. But when I do, I find it comfortable and able to do the job. However, I do wear it over my supportive nursing bra.",5

"Bumkins Waterproof Zippered Wet Bag, Blue Cat","I have a 3 week old baby boy, so I'm very new to cloth diapering. We've been using this wet bag since we got home from the hospital. It's the one we use for nighttime diaper changes and I really couldn't be more pleased with it.It holds a good amount of little diapers and prefolds. It washes nicely and even air drys super fast. I'm not too crazy about the print, but I can live with it.I couldn't be happier with this wetbag. I definitely recommend it.Update:After about 9 months of use the zipper broke and I had to cut the bag to get the diapers out. On top of that it started leaking after my son started solids and I had to put sprayed diapers in it. So it didn't hold up to lots of water. It worked well for the EBF stage, but I would recommend just getting a better wet bag.",2

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","My girl was very antsy sitting in the restaurant wooden chairs, and it seemed to be because she was sitting on hard wood, with a hard wooden back.  (actually, she was too small for the back to fit, so it was like stadium, backless seating for her).  This thing is great!  I've ordered a second one for Grandma's house.  It is small enough to take on the go, it is easy to use and clena, and she stays still in it for a LOT longer.... making restaurant meals much more pleasant for everyone around.",5

"Britax Decathlon Convertible Car Seat, Tiffany","I love this car seat. It was easy to get my toddler into while rear facing and also now that he's forward facing. He's very comfortable in it and easily falls asleep on long car rides. I trust the Britax brand and feel safe driving around with my son in a Britax. I will be buying this same car seat for my second born once he out grows his infant car seat. I'm thankful for the adjustable crotch strap, an important feature for boys!",5
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"We have gone through 12 different types of sippy cups, 3 straw types and this is the only one she will use.  There's no negative suction to suck food back through the straw.  She didn't have to bite the straw to make drink come out.  It just worked perfectly from the start.  I love the straw (great cleaner comes with the spare straw set).  We are so happy to finally find a cup that works.",5

"Graco Backless TurboBooster Seat, Galaxy","Don't get me wrong...Graco makes great seats. And this one is REALLY not that bad especially in terms of costs.  And we shouldn't buy these things for cost-savings.BUT, there are some things that should be revisited here.1) Safety-wisea. The tether that holds the shoulder belt seems dangerous.  For one thing, other manufacturers who make similar style seats, don't have this feature.  Sure, it's optional to use but it is suggested by the manufacturer.  The problem is, the shoulder belt must ""locked"" which means you'll have to pull out the shoulder belt portion all the way out until it ""ratches"" tight.  This, of course, will annoy your older child.  If you don't ratchet tight the belt, then the shoulder tether strap impedes the functionality of the shoulder belt ""locking"" correctly in the event of sudden braking.  Typically, what happens when there is sudden braking, shoulder belt portion locks when there is a ""tug"".  But when the shoulder belt is adjusted so that it snugs the shoulder more, there is a potential (and possible life-threatening) slack created here.  In other words, [1] it's the child's shoulder, [2] tether, then [3] shoulder retractor.  The adult setup is shoulder to retractor.  See the math here?b. The tether should be breakaway.c. If the tether is not used then the recommended minimum height should be raised so that seat belt portion for the shoulder does rest on the shoulder.  If not then, the child be placed into the 5-pt harness.d. All seats of this type should have latch capability.  When the seat belt is not firmly engaged, the child tends to slip between the back of the booster and the vehicle's rear seat.  If the child is not firmly secured in the belt (aka the shoulder belt is not locked) then they will squirm around in their seat which pushes out the booster from underneath the child.e. The sides of the seat should be ""winged"" upward so as to keep the child from ""straddling"" their legs over the sides of the seat.  Regular car seats are this way.  Realizing there are some children who have thicker thighs, for the sake of safety, comfort comes in second.  Can you imagine your child whose legs are straddling the booster seat on the receiving end of a ""T-bone"" car accident and his/her legs pinned between the door and the seat?? Yikes.2) Comfort-wisea. Not enough padding on the seat.  Again, padding is minimized for the sake of cost.  Yet, mom's and dad's can sit comfortably in memory foam leather (or cloth) seats.  Remember, a comfy child makes for them to be less squirmy.b. The optional backrest slot at the back of the booster seat keeps jabbing on the bottom of my child.  If there is not option to buy the back rest for this sit then why not make another model that doesn't have this slot?  Again, more padding.c. The arm rests are nice for the child (again for their comfort, I guess) but they also make it harder for my child to buckle themselves (at no matter of the arm rest height they are installed.)  Graco still doesn't seem to recognize that not all seat belt connectors are at the same height.  Some are recessed. And some are being interfered with by the arm rests.On the positive end, it is cheap for all the features you get.  At some point, however, you have to ask is the cost-savings worth it at the safety of my child.  Remember, the basic essentials are made to meet NTSA (and others) standards.  But additional safety features are made to protect and comfort your child.",3
"Friendly Toys, Little Playzone with Electronic Sound and Lights","If you have a home which i not 100% baby safe then this playzone is a life saver.  Compared to other fences, this playzone has Light weight but thicker panels with suction cups at the base which makes it almost impossible for the baby / toddler to move or push around making this playzone safer than others.It has Electronic sound + lights which keeps my little one entertained and of course you can leave favorite toys inside which keeps the baby busy while you do whatever needs to be done at home.  I highly recommend to get 2 extra panels which will make it a sufficient size for most homes and baby will also have enough space to move around.",5
"Neat Solutions Baby Einstein Biodegradable Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemat , 30-Count",Son loves Baby Einstein and when we go out to dinner this is a great addition. It sticks down on all 4 sides so he cannot lift the sides up. The only bad thing is that when it sticks to the table and you remove it when  you are leaving it can leave a residue and possible damage to nice tables.,4

"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","I ordered the Jasmine Giraffe first and since my daughter loved it so much I ordered the Ella Bella Elephant as well. I think these are such cute little comfort objects for a baby! My daughter is six months old and was starting to have a harder time going to sleep so we thought a comfort object might help bedtime go a little more smoothly. She absolutely loves her wubbanubs! She plays with them, cuddles with them, uses the attached pacifier (which surprised me because she rejected a couple other pacifiers we had tried) and holds one while she sleeps. She also figured out how to use it really quickly and will pick it up and put the pacifier in her mouth on her own. I also love the size, perfect for little baby hands to grasp, not too heavy for the pacifier, and doesn't add bulk to the diaper bag for on the go. This has been one of our most worthwhile baby buys!",5
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"If I had written this review right after getting this product, I'd be ecstatic: My daughter loved, it, you can take it everywhere, it has a lid and doesn't leak.Less than 2 1/2 months later, my daughter still loves it, and you can take it everywhere...but you'll leave a trial of water and have an empty cup when you arrive.We've soaked our carpet more times than I can count now -- through a leak that is impossible to identify.  It seems that the seal between the lid and the cup has 'worn out' - but I can't put the cap on tight enough.  I've taken it off, and put it back on - nothing.It just leaks.  And this is our 2nd one.  (We thought the first was just faulty.  Nope.  The brand is.)We won't be buying this brand again.",1
"Tadpoles Ultra-Soft Plush Baby Blanket, Light Blue",Great blanket. We love it and perfect size for our daughter. Great service. Hard to find good quality blanket and this one is good quality.,5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,"I buy a fair amount of the ""baby gear"" at consignment shops because it's all used for such a short amount of time, I hate to spend all that money for a few months of use. BUT, when it came to the highchair I got picky. I wanted a high chair that-did not look so very ""baby""ish-I could actually clean-didn't take up too much space-had a tray I could set down flat on the counter or table-has an easily removable coverThis high chair has all of these things and more! The fabric and straps truly are easy to clean. Even if you miss some food and find a little spot of dried baby food at the next feeding, it wipes right off! Plus, it is simple to take the cover off and throw it in the washing machine (some high chairs have the pad attached with SCREWS! Yes, terrible, but true). I also love how easy it is to adjust the straps. I knew I wanted a high chair that had a flat-bottomed tray, and now that I have it I am so glad I had the foresight to get one like that! I don't know where I would put the tray while I'm getting my son in and out of the chair if I couldn't just set it down on the table or counter.Some people think the footprint of this high chair is large, but I don't find it to be too big. It's as big as it needs to be for stability, but I think 4 legs would stick out wider.Some people are finding this high chair to be on the small side. My baby is on the very small side and he has plenty of room. I can't speak for big babies and how they would fit, as I have never seen one in my high chair. What I have observed is that most products seems to fit either big babies or small babies, but not both. Perhaps this is one of those small baby items. I have some things that my baby doesn't fit well in because he's small and they seem geared for large babies. I wish this high chair worked for everyone because I think it is perfect.",5
Carters 5 Piece Diaper Bag Set - Black &amp; Sage,"I really like the style of the bags and the value of getting all of the pieces, but there are no pockets inside of either diaper bags so it ends up just being a big mess of items and impossible to find things when you need them!",2
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.

"Munchkin Mighty Grip Trainer Cup 2-Pack, 8 oz, Colors Vary",I'm not crazy about this sippy cup.  I had to stop using it because it leaked so bad.  I checked everything to make sure it was properly seated and it was.  I only had experience with one so there is a possibility that I got a bad one.,3
"Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green","I love my new ""grass"".  I can finally get up in the morning to DRY bottles - the grass allows the water to drip away and holds all the little pieces in place.  You can fit a surprising amount of things on this, especially if you hang things off the edge (which is possible due to the cool blades of grass).  Wish it were a little bigger, but it's nice not to sacrifice too much countertop space.",5
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black",This isn't the best drink holder because it swings and isn't very sturdy. I guess it works considering the other choices out there. I have the Britax Be Agile and it would be nice if they had a hard plastic one that would attach. It's okay,3
Britax Back Seat Mirror,It is clear and a great size as long as you aren't moving....once you start moving the vibration makes it impossible to see your baby.  The adjustable arm is the cause of the lack of stability.  We have others that just attach to the headrest without swivel ability that do not have this,3
Sassy Ring O' Links 2 Pack,Great purchase! The colors are very bright and the baby enjoys holding on to it and feeling all the different textures.Highly recommend this product.,5

"Baby K'tan Breeze Baby Carrier, White, Large","Let me just start by saying that I never review anything, but I love this carrier so much I had to share my experience. Even if it doesn't work for you at first, it doesn't hurt to hold onto it because as your baby grows you can use other positions that may work for you better.I read a lot of the reviews here on Amazon on many of the carriers and went with this one because I preferred something that I wouldn't have to wrap around my body 100 times.  Also since it's summer now I thought the mesh would be perfect. I was right! The fabric is light so it's not overbearingly hot. (I haven't used it in the heat of summer yet, maybe the hottest temp was 80F.) It's soft and comfortable to wear.  And it's very easy to put on, if you go to the website they have some videos that help make it a little more clear.I'm pretty petite, about 5'3"" and 125 lbs after having my baby girl.  So I went with the XS size.  My little girl was born at 6lbs 7 oz, however I started using this when she was about 7.5 lbs. I was a little wary because she was under the 8 lb limit but I had to do something because she wanted to be held all the time.  The Baby K'tan was a lifesaver.  I could actually get stuff done.  Only caveat was that since she was still small sometimes I kept having to adjust the back loop because I felt her head wasn't high enough on my chest, and she would slide down. She couldn't fall out but things just felt a little loose. This was while she was in the Newborn Kangaroo hold. I would sometimes need to use an arm as an extra support as well. But having only one arm free is still better than having none! The fabric would stretch out after a few uses, but I would just throw it in the wash and dryer as others have stated. There was about one week when I actually felt she fit perfectly in the kangaroo hold, and I didn't have to support her much, but she outgrew that and things got a little tight.Fast forward to my daughter at 8 weeks old.  Haven't weighed her yet but she must be about 10 lbs.  I started putting her in the Hug Position and it is so much better! I feel totally confident in leaving both of my arms free to do things.  Like walking to the grocery store and coming home with both bags in both hands.As for the little one, she loves it.  She could be screaming while I put her in, but once she is in there snuggled up close to my chest she calms down and usually goes to sleep in 5 minutes.  She's taken 2 hour naps in this thing! I can't wait until she gets bigger and I can start trying some of the other positions.",5

"Munchkin Sesame Street Toddler Fork and Spoon, Elmo",My kids love this set. I ended up having to buy 2. It is sturdy and easy for little hands to use.,5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count",My 2 year old is moving up the potty training ladder and it helps to have these on hand when out in public. I like the fact that there are adhesives to prevent the topper from moving around.I think having a 10 pack is a good thing to help travel light.,4
Disney Toy Story LED Light-Up Decorative Pillow,This is NOT what I thought I was getting.  The LED part is a tiny little light.

"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","I bought this for my 6 month old grandson.  I liked the idea that it had a tray and activities attached,  It can also be used without the tray as a seat.  His chubby little legs fit in the openings with no problem unlike the bumbo seat.  He loves the toys that are attached and is safely belted in when placed on the floor.",5

"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Quarter Moon",I have two of these lights and both are junk.  The first was purchased in 10/2012 and that one lasted until 3/2013.  I ordered a new one and that one didn't work right out of the box.  I have emailed the company so I will wait and see what they do about it.  If they don't offer to replace them I will seek out a different brand of light as this one simply doesn't hold up.  BTW my children were not rough with the light and it wasn't left on except for during the night.  Under normal use I feel the product should last longer than 5 months.**Update.  The customer service for Kinderglo is very nice.  They replaced both of the lights and they arrived quickly.  I haven't had to use them yet but I am hopeful at least one of them will make it longer than 5 months.  We will see.,1
"Fisher-Price Royal Stepstool Potty, Blue","Saw this in store and decided that granddaughter Margaret was about to become a potty princess for her 2nd birthday. We used the convenience of amazon.com for the first time and are more than pleased. Product arrived before the expected date ,in good shape. It is colorful and Margaret enjoys the idea of sitting on the potty & playing the tune once she has completed her task of potty training. Would definitely recommend the product and your service.

"Munchkin Precision Digital Bottle Warmer, White","I haven't tried any other bottle warmer, so I don't have a comparison.  But I like that I can set the time on this for myself, and that it's tall enough to cover an 8-oz bottle.  I do have two issues with it: the first issue is the mechanism for adding water to the warmer.  There's a plastic &#34;jug&#34; that comes out, you add water, and then you have to turn it upside down to put it back into the warmer.  So water inevitably spills out.  Additionally, hot water spills out when the bottle warmer is in use.  And the second issue is something I've seen others say: the bottle warmer turned off midway through a warming cycle, and I couldn't turn it back on.",3
"Graco Pack 'N Play with Newborn Napper Elite, Vance","I purchased this pack n play for my 4th child.  I knew what I wanted - a low changing table, the bassinet for the newborn and a place to put diaper necessities.  The music feature was just a bonus.  I opened the box and set up the crib.  Everything looked good except the accessory/diaper holder that hangs off the side.  It was flimsy and didn't look like it would hold more than a few baby items without ripping off or spilling them all on the floor.  The bassinet was darling and the changing section was OK.  It looked like it would be in the way if I put the baby in the crib with the mattress in the higher position.  The music feature was really awesome. You can plug in a portable device like an ipod or phone and play music, but I really wanted a portable crib that had it's own place for accessories.  I returned this crib and am still looking for another that fits my needs.",2
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"Once I learned how to use this breast pump (learning the suction technique of it)  I absolutely love it.  I am a stay at home mom but wanted something affordable, easy to use, and easy to tote to pump milk to have for outings and so that my husband would be able to feed our daughter too.  Once let down occurs, I have easily gotten 4 ounces in a matter of 10 minutes or even less.  I would recommend this pump to anyone who wants to save money but would like to find a pump that they can depend on.  I was unsure of purchasing a pump before we had our daughter because they tend to be expensive and some do not work for everyone.  After reading the reviews on the isis I found that it probably is the best on the market.  I would'nt trade it for an electric pump as I have also read that others felt the same way.  It is also great to know that all avent bottles easily screw on to the pump.  So as you need to use bigger bottles it is just a matter or purchasing them and hooking them up.  The avent isis pump is easy to clean, easy to take apart, and put back together.  I hope that whoever purchases this is as happy as I have been.",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sounds Full Color Video and Audio Monitor,"This has everything expensive monitors have for a lot less money. This is my third baby monitor. Even if you don't buy this model make sure you get a baby monitor with voice activation. That white noise is very annoying.Another thing a lot of the monitors cause is mess up your wireless connection. If they work on 2.4GHz for example. This one is the only one I had that was secure and didn't drop my wireless network.The image is very clear. It has temperature alarm (great if baby's room is on the second floor). talk back, zoom.Some reviews complained about the second camera not coming up with noise activation, but the unit vibrates. I leave it on my night stand and the vibration is really intense, enough to wake me up.Don't think more, get this one.",5

Ginsey Dora The Explorer Step Stool,"I purchased this so my daughter would be better able to reach the kitchen sink.  The stool works great and is extremely sturdy and even mom and dad can use it.  My daughter was thrilled with the Spongebob design.  The only problem is it gets in the way in the kitchen sometimes, but that is no fault of the stool, and it is holding up great to getting bumped around the kitchen.",5
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White","This product is a must-have if you need to baby-proof a house. Much more convenient than the simple plastic plugs you can stick in outlets. You can plug and unplug as needed without needing a screwdriver to remove stuck plugs. The spring loaded mechanism is pretty tight making it very hard for an inventive and strong toddler to slide the cover aside. Even if the toddler is capable of that, it would not leave a free hand to actually stick anything in at the same time. With the cover on it is impossible to stick anything in.To install, just replace the face plate of the outlets with these. They cover the original outlets, so no rewiring is needed. Screws are supplied in case the original screws are too short to accommodate the slightly thicker plates.There are some flimsy competitive products out there. So I made sure to get sturdy ones. These are pretty sturdy, allowing you to screw them on real tight without cracking or even bending them.",5

"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","This gate has brought a little bit of sanity back into my life, as we have an 8m old black lab/border collie mix who was driving me crazy stealing from my bedroom.  I needed a solution other than just closing the door as our cats sleep in there, and I was tired of stepping over or de-installing/re-installing the cheap wooden gate that we originally got.  After reading a lot of reviews, I decided against a cheaper gate and chose this one, which is still very reasonably priced.  I have been very happy with it.  We installed it in the hallway just outside our bedroom door so used the extensions on both sides.  It installed pretty easily and it is easy to open and close.  So far, my ultra-smart pup hasn't figured out how to open it. :-)  The gate is a little bit on the narrow side for me, as I am no skinny-minny, to say the least, but I have had no problems with it and I am soooooo happy to have it.  I am thinking about getting another one or two so that I can create an indoor ""play-pen"" in connecting hallways for the pup that allows me to move around the house without relative ease and still keep destructo-pup contained when he is in the house.  Definitely would buy again and recommend.  A very good value.",5
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"I bought this set of spoons for a gift to my friends who are first-time-parents.  The colors are fantastic.  I like they are BPA free too, and gentle on baby gums and mouth.  Wish I'd had some when my kids were babies.",4
Snoogle Chic Jersey - Snoogle Replacement Cover with Zipper for Easy Use - Heather Gray,"I bought this cover because it matches my bed sheets very well, and when I change the sheets every week I like to just put the second set on, but I didn't have another Snoogle pillow case!

I have never tried other brands, but I hear that they are not as effective as the Inspired by Finn's, and I didn't want to chance it, so I bought the real deal :)  I would highly recommend these to anyone with a suffering teething baby.",5
"ERGObaby Performance Collection Infant Insert, Charcoal Black",I got this insert hoping it would fit in a carrier I bought that resembles the Ergo.  Its called the Onya it works perfectly! So happy that I can use this carrier now.  My daughter is 7bls at one month and she seems to like the chest to chest time with mom in the carrier. I was told that you can also use the bottom cushion as a booster seat when she gets older.  I like that idea!,5
Earlyears Roll n Swirl Ball Ramp,"I bought this toy for my 1 year old granddaughter, and while she enjoys playing with it, every time she picks it up the sections come apart.  It is very small (about 1 foot tall), and I think it could have been made as a one piece unit that would not come apart.  Honestly, my first thought when I saw it was how cheaply made it is and that someone made a heck of a profit on it!! Still, as long as you are willing to sit with your child and play with them making sure the toy stays together the child will have a lot of fun--so I guess it promotes family togetherness!",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"All of the great reviews of this product encouraged me to purchase it and I'm so glad I did!  This will be a birthday present for my daughter (who, by the way, won't have her 1st birthday until November), but I wanted to make sure that we have educational toys for her, and this truly is very musically educational.  A great toy to incorporate the elements of instrumental music.",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red",We love this carrier.  We had the other kind without the added back support and I couldn't use it for very long.  The added support makes my 22lb. 6 month old much easier to carry around and she is very happy in it. You can turn her to face you and she will sleep or face out and she can look around.  I use it all the time!,4
Medela Symphony Double Pumping System,"I LOVE THIS PUMP!!!!!!!!! After 3 months, 3 electric pumps, and 2 hand pumps, it was brought to my attn that I had a hospital grade pump at my job the whole time. I was comparing pumps on Amazon, and I noticed every pump was being compared to the symphony. After googling the symphony and seeing the picture, I saw that it looked like the pump at my job.Well I ordered the parts on Sunday, and they get here on Tuesday. On my first break, which is 20 minutes, I go to the security desk to get access to the lactation room. I work overnight, so I have to go through security. Even though I told them ahead of time I was coming, They still were 10 minutes late. I only had 10 minutes to pump. Normally I only get about 3-4(1 1/2 on each side) ounces in about 18 minutes. I was able to go over the 4oz(2 on each side) in 7 minutes, and still had time to clear the condensation from the tubes.Plus I don't have to take the pump apart and clean it after each pump. I work overnight, so I just put the parts in the freezer until the next pumping session. I am so happy. I get to actually enjoy my breaks, and lunches at work. I may even rent one from the hospital. I'm sooooooo happy!!!!!!!!!!!111",5
Philips AVENT 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer,PAID GOOD MONEY FOR THIS THING AND IT DIDN'T EVEN LAST 5 MONTHS. TOTAL PIECE OF CRAP AND CANNOT AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.,1
"Boon Lawn Countertop Drying Rack, Green","When I bought the Boon drying rack they only had the Grass out. Since they've come out with this one and it's almost double the size. I love it. I also have the flower and tree ring/nipple holders. Cute, product! I kept the Grass and used it for traveling.",5
Pooh's Sweet Times Musical Mobile,"Love this mobile.  It matches the decor in my daughter's room perfectly.  She loves it!  She watches it intently as the characters move around.  The music lasts quite a while when completely wound up.  The only thing is that it won't work on all types of cribs.  It will only work on straight rail cribs and there is no way to modify it.  I have a crib that has sloping rails and I had to kinda jerry-rig it to get it stay on.  Otherwise, I was very pleased.  Perhaps if the manufacturer included a clamp for sloping rails or the availability to buy one, it would be helpful.",4
"NUK Infant Tooth and Gum Cleanser and Finger Toothbrush Set, 1.4 Ounce",our daughter is 9 months old and loves the flavor of this and loves to have her teeth and gums brushed. we always brush during bathtime and i swear she would let us brush for an hour while she chews on it at the same time. start the brushing early and it becomes a habit that they look forward to,5

bumGenius Freetime All-In-One One-Size Snap Closure Cloth Diaper - White,"I have tried MANY different types of cloth diapers and many different cloth diapering systems. These Freetime diapers are, by far, my favorite!They do NOt leak! Fit great! And clean up really well! They even dry really well (and fast)!The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish that they would start using a different material other than the microfiber for the insert flaps. I wish that the design of the organic elemental freetime diaper was the same as this one.Either way, I highly recommend it. Very easy to use system that my husband even enjoys!",4
"Medela Contact Nipple Shield, Small","I needed this shield because my nipples were too small and wouldn't get hard or long enough for my newborn to get a proper latch.  I used these for about 2-3 weeks and my nipples soon became well enough that I stopped depending on them so much.  The only negative part about using these shields is having to wean your baby afterward from depending on them to latch and instead latch directly onto your nipple, but it wasn't hard to get that done.",5
Comfort U Total Body Support Pillow (Full Size),"This pillow has unfortunately replaced my husband (not really, but he has like, two feet on his side of the bed now) because it is so awesome! If you have a partner, well, just push them over and curl up with this giant &#34;tooth&#34; as my husband calls it!I have severe sacroiliac/ sciatic pain along with shoulder pain that makes my fingers go numb-this pillow relieves the pressure on my neck and shoulders and hips. I also find that I do not move around as much in my sleep with this (kind of like being swaddled) which keeps me from waking up as often in the night.It is easy to clean, but a pain to get into its sleeve. I haven't bought an official pillow case for it because I am cheap, but so far, I really don't see the point since it comes with the zippered white case. I have steam sanitized this pillow in my dryer, but I have not washed it in full water and wouldn't suggest it as the stuffing inside seems like those cheap pillows that knot up if you wash and dry them. It holds its shape very well and is durable as all get out-I have not heard one seam rip, even when dragging it up the at an awkward angle. Highly recommend.",5
"Regalo Extra Tall Top of Stair Gate, White","Works well for what I needed, I have two bannisters that don't line up, so this is set up at an angle and connected to two bannisters, no wall. It is surprisingly solid with velcro straps on each side. Took about an hour to set up, but easy to figure out. My child can't get it open or push it. I feel safe with him upstairs with this gate. To open and close the locking mechanism, you may need two hands, but it gets easier as you get the hang of it. It is not automatic, but more solid than the self closing one I have downstairs. If you need to connect to a bannister, especially with two bannisters, this seems like the best option on Amazon.",5
"Badger Basket Embassy Wood Baby High Chair with Tray, Espresso","A favorite uncle gave us two of these high chairs for our twin daughters, which we really appreciated.  The three positive features of the chairs were:  1) the chairs are made out of lovely wood, so they blended in really well with our other wood kitchen chairs (although our entire house is, of course, given over to baby gear, so this wasn't too much of a plus, since we've given up on how things look); 2) the dishwasher-safe top tray is awesome--not too big, so you can get two trays into the dishwasher, plus some dishes too; and 3) when we threw out the chairs, they were easy to disassemble and fit compactly into our trash can.Now, for the considerable negatives of these high chairs: 1)  The cloth covers for the plastic seat pads looked dirty upon arrival, so I washed them according to the instructions, at which point the covers totally fell apart.  This left us with exposed velcro strips on the seats, which eventually collected all sorts of baby food and crumbs that would not come off.  2)  There is a five-point safety harness that is totally useless for keeping a baby in place.  Our girls are big, 32"" and 26 lbs. at one year, and yet, even though big, they would tend to fall down underneath the tray while sitting in the chair, with only one little strap holding them in place.  In other words, their back would be laying flat on the seat, and their legs would be headed toward the floor.  There is no easy way to rescue a baby who gets into this position, since the wood tray underneath the dishwasher-safe plastic tray is bolted on.  So basically you have to yank the baby up through the fixed wood tray at a very awkward angle. This led to lots of tears. 3)  An even worse safety situation occurred for us more than once when the babies discovered they could turn entirely around in the chairs, so that their backs were facing the tray.  A baby can do this because there is no back on the high chair and the harness straps are so flimsy.  The first time one of our girls turned around like this, I had moved about ten feet away to get a spoon, and when I turned back towards the high chairs, I was horrified to see my girl pushing off against the wall with her feet, so that the high chair was falling backwards.  I caught the chair just in time.  Our girls continued to think that this process of turning around in the high chair was a very fun game, much more fun than actually eating.  4)  There is no good way to clean these chairs.  The straps are bolted on and can't be removed to wash them, and food does not come off the wood easily.  5)  I suspect the chairs are very uncomfortable for a baby--kind of like sitting on a wood bleacher seat.We have just bought our girls new, plastic high chairs, with a cushioned seat pad, and the babies obviously love them.  I love that I can throw the straps and seat pads in the washing machine.  Our new high chairs also have a dishwasher-safe tray cover.  Most important, our girls aren't going anywhere until we take them out of the chairs!!!",1
Babysafe Sunscreen Towelettes Broad Spectrum SPF 30,I would give these 5 stars if they weren't so expensive. These are so convenient and go on easily. You do still need to rub it in a bit.,4
"Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep","This has been a vital part of our daily life with our newborn. She is now 4 months old, and we have used it everyday. It is a great soother. We mostly use the ocean wave sound with our baby during nap times. It helps here to sleep soundly and blocks some noises so she doesn't get startled in her sleep so easily. I use the rain setting when I lay her in her crib for just a few minutes. I tell her I am coming right back and she stays calm until I pick her back up. Recently we took her on her first trip to visit family, and we were sure to pack the sleep sheep. I highly recommend the Cloud B sleep sheep. It makes for a great baby shower gift too!",5
SoHo Fire Trucks Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"When I received the crib bedding set I was thrilled.

One Step Ahead Secure Transitions Inflatable Baby Tub,"We used this tub for about 7 months and loved it. It ended up getting a hole in it, but to be fair we were in the process of moving and packed it up many times and brought it different places along the way. Thankfully my daughter was ready for the big tub by the time it got the hole. I'm sure I could patch it, but haven't tried. I would recommend this and buy it again.",5

"Delta Canton 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Dark Cherry","The crib looks beautiful and is very sturdy.  I was a little unsure at first when putting it together because the peices were light and looked/felt a little on the cheap side.  But once the crib was put together I was very pleased with the end results.  One of the toprails had a 6"" crack in it, but I called customer service for Delta Children's Products and they replaced the broken rail.  When we opened the package, it took a while to find the instructions (which is located in an envelope on the springs).  Also, none of the peices of the crib were labeled as ""A"", ""B"", etc.  So we had to go off of the pictures in the instruction manual, which was pretty easy.  One thing that I really liked was that the crib came with a guard rail for when you convert the crib into a daybed.  I did not know that the guard rail was included in the set, so that was an added bonus.  Before ordering I read previous reviews about the color of the crib.  I ordered the Expresso color, but it is more like a dark cherry.  I think the crib was a good investment for the price, but I am not sure if the crib will last until my child goes to college.",4
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","This bra is a lifesaver, well, maybe not a &#34;life&#34; saver but a time saver.  You can pump without fear of the breastshields coming loose, so there is nothing to interrupt your pumping session.  I also have the L-XL, which covers more (I'm a 36 DD), and while this XS-L fits, you can see the breasts at the bottom of the bra.  I wear the L-XL throughout the day, but I put this XS-L on over a nursing bra which serves its purpose quite well.  I will be buying another one, just the L-XL for better coverage.",5
"Dr. Brown's Soft Spout Training Cup, 6 Ounce, Colors May Vary","As a mom of twins, I'm always looking for the best and easiest to use products for my girls.  I read the reviews but decided to give the product a try.  So glad I did. Just ordered extras to get here for this weekend!  My girls love the cups.  They don't leak, and the mouth spout isn't roo big so there is no drool either.  Haven't had any problems with ""sucking air"".Wish there was a lid to convert to a training cup!!",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Twin Electric Breast Pump,My wife and I have twin boys Ronan and Lex. This pump has been a godsend for us. It allows me to take care of the boys while she gets some rest. Excellent quality at a great value!,5
New Boba Wrap in Red with Matching Carrying Pouch : Infant Baby Carrier : Preemie - 18months (Previously Sleepy Wrap),"My son is over 20lbs. and after walking a mile in this, he still didn't sag, and liked it enough to fall asleep.This was very comfortable and I have been in two car accidents a year ago.At babyandbump.com, a lot of the moms said a stretchy wrap would be no good for a heavier baby, but I just wrapped this very tight and had no problems.I also had enough length left over to wrap around to my back again and tie it.  This gave me the ability to stretch that fabric over my son's feet and make stirrups.  I can also use this length if I use the wrap to hold my 10 pound Min Pin in it.  I tie the extra up around my neck.One thing I don't like is the print is not double sided.I can't wait until I can afford to order a solid color or two.The website has great instruction videos.I own three different Infantino wraps & carriers as well.  This is the best of all of them.  My second choice for something cheaper would be the Infantino Union Ergonomic Carrier.",5
"Fisher-Price Bath Tub, Tadpole",I'm happy with this purchase because aside from the tub being small I can hang in the bathroom. My son is 13 weeks and so far he's good for the tub. I would recommend.,5
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"I have used both the Diaper Genie (original) and the Diaper Champ for over two years.  Although the Diaper Genie is a little tricky to load, it is not bad once you get used to it. It sounds the the ""new"" Genie makes refilling even easier. The Genie refills are more expensive compared to the standard kitchen bags of the Champ (hence 4 stars instead of 5).  However, the Genie is far superior to the Champ.  The Genie uses a tube of plastic to encapsulate the dirty diaper with a twisting mechanism.  This seals dirty diapers indivually as they are deposited and results in significanly less odor than the Champ or other lidded diaper pail.  Every time you put a diaper in the Champ the plunger mechanism blasts you with the stench of the previous week's dirty diapers.  Another benefit of the Genie is that the plastic tube where diapers are inserted is disposable.  If the diapers are not wrapped upon themselves such that no poop is exposed, it ends up coming off where diapers are inserted into can.  For the Genie, this part is thrown away with diapers, for the Champ, this is a fixed tube and plunger that smears and is difficult to clean.  I got so tired of cleaning the Champ every week that I eventually stopped using it.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for the Genie inserts, it's worth the extra sanity during hectic times.",4
Jeep Car Seat Travel Bag,"i bought two of these for our large evenflo symphony carseats.  they fit nicely and are pretty easy to put on, but one of them came with a broken clip for the shoulder strap.  i don't know if i'll bother with getting a new one, the clip looks pretty cheap anyway, so i doubt the other one will survive our trip.  but for the price, should work quite well.",4

"GoFreshBaby Reusable Food Pouch, 6 Pack Complete Pack with Filling Funnel","The concept behind these are great, but this specific kind is terrible. While trying to open 2 of the pouches the seal came apart from the pouch itself. Once I actually got them open the plastic is so hard that it was impossible to fill it all the way. And then once it was used it is extremely hard to get food out of the very bottom of the pouch, and I even have a small specialty brushes made for baby sippy cups and small hard to clean places. Don't wait your time on these.",1

"Orbit Baby Stroller Panniers, Mocha","I think these are rather pricey for what you get. However, if you own an orbit baby and looking at these, then that most likely isn't too much of an issue.These are great, they integrate well, stow away on the stroller and don't get in the way when the stroller is collapsed. Well thought out, although they are quite simple. As far as adding width to the stroller, it adds about 4 inches more on each side to the wheelbase. Hasn't been too much of an issue so far...",4

"Major League Baseball 2-in-1 Baby Carrier, San Francisco Giants","Pros: -Best air circulation on any carrier I've had.-Baby can face either way with this carrier, and its pretty easy to switch them out if they get fussy or tired.-Comfortable fit for both parent and baby (I cant speak for more than 15 pounds though, but excellent for smaller infants)-Nice design for guys that don't want an embarrassing mom carrier-Grows with your baby with easy to adjust latches that you can change as the baby growsCons: -Its a little bulky and might draw attention from giants fans that want to give you constant high fives.Overall this is an excellent carrier for either a SF Baseball fan or just anyone in general. It does an excellent job supporting the young one while making sure you feel comfortable as well. Definitely has very little fault. 5 stars,",5

See Me Smile Infant Mirror Tan Bear,"The install on this took one to two minutes on my headrest in my SUV. It's so much better than the mirror I had with my now preschool age daughter when she was rear-facing. It hasn't shifted during driving, and the mirror has the best visibility I've seen, and I have researched these until my eyes glazed over. It's also one of the best-priced and really cute. I've read other reviews that indicate difficulty with the size of this mirror coupled with the plush toy because they block the view out of the rear window (an obvious safety issue). Consider the type of car you're installing it in and whether you are installing it on the side headrest. I can imagine it'd be too obtrusive to install in the middle of even my SUV's back seat.",5
"Munchkin High Capacity Drying Rack, White","I'm glad I purchased this bottle holder, it's large enough to hold all my son's bottles and all the pieces to my medela breast pump removable parts. It's small enough to sit right up next to the sink without getting in the way. Overall great product.",5
"Dream On Me 3&quot; Rounded Corner Playard Mattress, White/Brown","If you are wondering if this mattress will fit in a Graco Pack n Play, wonder no longer. It is a perfect fit. It also happens to be a nice mattress with inner springs in it. I bought this because I needed some way to put my daughter to sleep at an incline to help with a reflux problem, so I put a couple of regular pillow underneath one end of it, and that worked like a charm. However, even if you don't need to incline the mattress I would still recommend buying it. It is much more comfortable than the hard bottom of the Pack n Play, and it fits all the way to the edges perfectly.",5
Thank Heaven for Little Boys Baby Bib,Easy to close and stay on.. HUGE and comes clean! I also have the little girl version and LOVE this bib... not the price so much!,5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"I absolutely love this stroller.  It works perfectly for our family needs.  Yes the storage is minimal but if you're simply using it to carry some diapers etc in a small carry, it's perfect.  I like how light weight it is but not so much that its flimsy.  My two-year old son is 40 lbs and this is great for him.  Some reviews addressed the fact that when you close it up the wheels dirty up the top but this is no big deal. And also this is easy open and close.  Very much recommend.",5
"babyletto Madison Swivel Glider, Mocha","You've no doubt read all these other reviews and all are true.  This is the perfect little rocker glider for a small nursery like mine. It's perfect  for rocking even my 25 lb grandson to sleep. My 6'1 husband sits comfortably in it too. No problem nursing just wrap a Boppy around your waist.  If you saw the reviews about the uneven seating of the feet, unfortunately that is also true. The center plastic bolt is too thick making the rubber feet on the perimeter unable to reach the floor so the metal  base noisily rocked back and forth. I fixed this in 2 seconds flat by placing small round felt stick okn furniture pads to all the outer rubber feet. That elevated the swivel base higher than the center bolt. Now the ride is smooth and steady and whisper quiet. The size is perfect. The seat is cushy, the fabric is super soft and stain resistant so 5 stars for the little chair that could!!",5
"Nat and Jules Blankie Rattle Plush Toy, Sadie Giraffe",I received this as a gift and absolutely love it!! I had several other lovey blankets but find this one by far is the cutest and my 4 month old prefers this one has well.  He'll kind of pet it as he's falling asleep. I take it away once he's asleep.  It machine washed and dried well.,5
6Pcs Japanese Iwako Erasers-Elephants,"I love elephants, so when I saw these elephant erasers at an affordable price I jumped on the offer right away and purchased the little cuties, haha :D They arrived earlier than expected, which is always a pleasant surprise. Mine came in light green, red, grey, pink, purple, and yellow. They were all cute, and it is quite amusing switching their trunks, heads, and bodies. As far as erasers go, they get the job done and erase very smoothly. I personally wouldn't want to use them as erasers, since they're so cute, but they do work well if you're curious or bought them to use as erasers ;). They are great for collectors and children, along with everyone else. A perfect value and totally adorable! :)",5

Sunshine Kids Sure Fit Child Seatbelt Adjuster,"My wife is only 4' 11&#34; so seat belts cut across her neck.  We had hoped that this would help.  As soon as we opened the package, we noticed that it says it is not to be used by adults.  We tried it on anyway and found that it is difficult enough to get on that it is a hassle if you want to move it to another seat and that the Velcro on the upper portion tends to rub against your neck and it is not comfortable. It also tended to get twisted and was difficult to get the seat belt on correctly without having to check to be sure it was not twisted.  We returned it for a refund.",1
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,I absolutely love this product.  It is so convenient for mixing formula without having to shake a bottle.  My daughter has a very sensitive tummy and we do everything we can to keep the extra air out of her belly.  When we would shake up a bottle it would be half full with foam.  With this pither we get almost no foam plus we love premixing for the day.,5
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"I wish I bought 4 of these off the bat, and didn't waste my money on anything else. These are the only bibs that my son can't easily pull off. It catches all of the food, and washes easily. You can also put them on the top rack of the dishwasher!!!I tried the soft plastic bibs, and they just don't work. My son would pull them right. They were a pain to wash and dry, and really didn't catch all of the food. These catch food and keep my son dry. They are so easy to clean. I really wish I had these when my son first started eating baby food. The neck looks small, but fits him well and is adjustable. My 11 year old nephew put it on as a joke, and it fit!",5
Medela Supplemental Nursing System,I truly believe this helped me get my supple back. It is a little bit bulky but the benefit out weights any cons. I truly recommend this.,5
"Graco Argos 65 3-in-1 Harness Booster, Link","Short story, I was very disappointed with the quality and thought of the engineering on the product.  The best installation I could accomplish severely compromised the strap strength, but in a way that you may not notice or appreciate.  Save your time, check a different brand.Long story: I thoroughly researched the next carseats for our twin boys who are big-ish (90th percentiles) and just passing the rear-facing weight limits.  I compared this in-person to the prior model (Argos 70) based on Consumer Reports ratings.  This looked to be essentially the same.  Otherwise I may have gone for the Nautilus (for fear that the ratings wouldn't apply to this new model), but the Argos had slightly better crash ratings.  Let me say, it really is a nice looking seat, and the surfaces that come into contact with the toddlers are nice. I also really love the easily adjustable height. But...  I spent about 2 hours wrestling this thing around to try to get it to hold position in our seats.  I'm 6""4 and about 230lbs, so it should be pretty easy for me.  I've also had several seats now, so I'm familiar with different systems and mechanisms of installation.  And, I tried a number of different seat angles, clip placements, head restraint positions, etc.  Point being, I'm capable and was thorough.  For me, the fatal flaw was in the shell structure around the belt path.  I was using the LATCH belt, but the real problem was also present with a seatbelt install.  Namely, the path that the belt must take has it draping down over a plastic corner (so it bunches), some of which is 90degrees and rather sharp (e.g. it would cut a banana, or I assume a compromised belt strap in a crash).  Download the product manual, and you can see, on the page that has the warning that ""Belts must lay flat,"" that the picture of the installation is not logically possible.  It has been altered with the LATCH attachments in the car shown angled (they are not), and a belt shape that on close inspection would lay in a squared U-shape to stay flat and negotiate the turns required by the routing guides.  I thought that this might be new to the new model, but I confirmed the same basic shape with the older Argos and with the Nautilus.  I didn't get out a ruler and measure, but it looked the same.  You can see that they have engineered a smooth belt path that exits directly out the back of the seat (i.e. it would run the belt parallel to the ground).  But, by definition, the belt needs to go back and DOWN at an angle.  Doing so brings it out of that smooth path and over a 90-degree section of the plastic shell (I'll see if I can upload a picture).This being my first time with this size carseat, I got a Britax model for comparison (our last seats were Marathons).  I immediately noticed the difference in engineering. It isn't even close.  The new Graco engineering/construction were similar to the 7-year old Britaxes (although they installed instantly and correctly in minutes).  The engineering and construction has come a LONG way since then.  I wish someone had simply told me that Graco seats weren't to be bothered with.  Furthermore, the biggest perk of the Graco (the design/style) is now offensive because it means they'll do R&D; but evidently only in the window dressing department (which admittedly, Britax could use a dose of).  Other issues: cheap single-belt (i.e. single point-of-failure) LATCH belt, cheap LATCH clips, no energy-absorbing tether,cheap shoulder belt pads, chest clip that somehow simultaneously is IMPOSSIBLE to open and can be opened instantly by a toddler, and worthless crotch belt pad which I think IS actually important.  Finally, for easy (i.e. cheaper) shipping, the seat folds back and forth (the first step of assembly in the manual).  By comparison, the Britax are static and have solid steel beams running basically l-shaped down the side (and have to ship in a big, expensive box).CHECKING FOR YOURSELF: PLEASE go look at some of these in a store.  Look at the belt paths, the clip quality, etc.  Tug on the crotch pad, feel shoulder pads, etc.  Check out the websites: one is all about ""safety is when you have a pad next to your head"" and the other is all about engineering and crash tests.  Also, I do think that some other brands looked more comparable to the Britax than the Graco, so please read this as more of an impeachment of Graco than an endorsement of Britax for anything other than comparison.",1
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"I bought one of these to see if it would fit over an extra-long power strip. The product description wasn't entirely clear, and it turns out that the description is at the small side. Sliding the case, it can cover larger power strips.It's also remarkably child-proof. Our household has an 8-month-old who's getting into everything. While she's usually blocked from getting to the computer desks, it's smart to err on the side of caution and protect every power strip in the house.I'm very pleased with this product and will order more, now that I see how versatile, sturdy, and safe they are.",4

We live in the foothills where there are any number of critters that try to eat our livestock, so being able to keep my eyes and/or ears on them through the night makes me feel much better.This baby monitor isn't just for human babies, it works very well for our four legged babies as well.

It is super soft, really cute, washes nicely *as opposed to others that never look the same after you wash it the first time*, and rolls up nice and small with backpack straps that are adjustable for even a small child to carry it.  Our daughter LOVES this mat and gets excited to lay down on it at nap time and even wants to use it at home when we bring it home to wash.  Well worth the money and even with frequent use I believe this will be the only mat I have to ever purchase for my daughter to use at preschool.  It just keeps it's color and looks really nice despite the wear and washes.",5

I'm sure many softer mattresses are perfectly safe as well, but if you are SIDS-obsessed like I was, then the firmest mattress you can get is the way to go. And if your babe is always on a firm/foam mattress, he/she won't know the difference (""Where IS my tempur-pedic!?!) and sleep safely, soundly and happily.I'm about to order two more new from amazon for our twins due in November. Yes, it's an investment, but there are a few things you should throw a little money at ... breast pumps, car seats and crib mattresses are good things to spend a little more on (using reviews and research, of course) to make sure you're getting what you want, what will work for you and what is best for your baby.",5

Living in the city makes it hard to lug around a large stroller (in fact, I still have the Chicco Cortina stroller in its box!), but the Snap N' Go is lightweight and easy to maneuver.  In addition, it fits well in my midsize sedan's trunk with tons of room to spare.  I also love the cup-holders for my *cold* coffee and the little compartment for my keys.

Jeep Shopping Cart and High Chair Cover,"I am really happy with this purchase.  It is extremely convenient for many reasons:  it folds into a bag with handles so it is easy to carry, it can tie onto carts and highchairs and has its own belt, the pocket holds a lot of stuff which is great when grocery shopping with a baby, it is really well padded, it can be put in the washer and dryer, and toys can hook right onto it so they don't keep falling on the ground.I highly recommend!The only negative I have is that one time it did not fit well on the shopping cart and the strap ended up around my daughters neck.  Of course I was right there so it wasn't there long. The straps that go over the shoulders are not adjustable and are a little high so if it doesn't fit the cart well you do have to be careful.",4

"Chicco Keyfit 22 Pound Infant Car Seat And Base, Hazelwood","I bought this right before the KeyFit 30 came out and thought I'd be kicking myself for not waiting to get the newer one, but I don't have any regrets now.  I have no desire to carry any kiddo over 22 lbs around in a bulky infant seat, and each of our kids outgrew the height requirement before the weight requirement.I originally chose the Chicco for its super high safety ratings and smooth features.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat for it's durability. 3 kids later, this seat still looks BRAND NEW.  We've had diaper explosions, spit ups, formula spills and the like.  The fabric seat comes off relatively easy and can be thrown in the wash. Twenty or so washes later, there is no fading, no piling, no wear whatsoever.  I'm amazed that 3 kids and countless washes later, it still looks like it just came out of the box. We've had friends give us their used BabyTrend and Graco carseats as ""backups,"" and they always look faded, worn, and flimsy. We ended up getting another Chicco as a backup for Gma and Gpa's house.  For something that is inevitably going to be washed (several times), it's great that there's a product out there that looks just as nice after a wash cycle (or ten).The Chicco is by far the easiest infant car seat to carry on your arm.  The handle is genius -- the corners of the handles (where the handle rests against your inner arm while carrying it in the crook of the elbow) are smooth and flatter.  Much nicer than either the Graco, BabyTrend, or Britax.  Although the Graco is a tad lighter than the Chicco, the difference in quality is obvious. The Chicco is substantially more high quality, from the frame to the base to the smaller features.The newborn insert padding is perfect for little ones (and we've washed this too -- still looks new). The head pillow is a perfect solution to those floppy necks without being too intrusive in the seat.  I love that the head pillow can be easily adjusted to a higher level in seconds.  It is easily more functional than any other infant insert/neck pillow out there. We use a JJ Cole Bundlme Urban during winter months -- it works great with the Chicco. There are also small strap pads included that keep the straps clean and prevent the straps from rubbing against baby's neck.  Chicco thought of everything and put it all in one box with the seat -- no need to buy additional neck pillows, inserts, or strap covers.When we bought our Britax B Ready stroller, we thought that we would get the Britax Infant car seat for our 3rd child, even though our Chicco wasn't expired.  We thought that the Britax car seat would be nice to have so we could just click it into the stroller.  After trying it out in Babies R Us, we quickly realized that the Britax was lacking some of Chicco's best features -- a plush, padded, durable seat (Britax's seat cover is thin and hard), an easy base, and the infant inserts.  We decided to stick with our Chicco and just buy the Britax B Ready adapter that lets you nap in the Chicco car seat to the B Ready stroller.The carseat release to remove the seat from the base is very easy to use, and the Latch system is very user-friendly to install. We're able to get this base a lot more snug in the backseat than the Graco or BabyTrend we've tried.  I also love that there's a little hidden compartment in the base. We keep extra wipes, diapers, and a pacifier in there for emergency use.  We've also used the seat on occasion without the base, and it works great.  We like that the seat cover actually covers up the ""hooks"" for a seatbelt when not in use.  It gives the carseat an overall smoother, clean look.Of course, there are some small things I would change...unfortunately, the seat only comes with one base.  Others have mentioned that the sunshade is not as large as they would like, but I haven't seen a better one elsewhere.  Some shopping carts don't fit the seat upfront by the handles as securely as other seats.  We put our infant seat sideways at the very end of the cart.  It's much more stable and I don't worry about the seat falling.  Baby seems to enjoy the view as well.  Of course I'd love the carseat to be lighter weight, but I'd trade in a few extra ounces for a better safety rating any day!We'll keep our Chicco, the features and durability can't be beat!",5

"Super Undies! Bedwetting Pants, The Purple Pixie (Lavender), X-Large","They leak on my five year old daughter, who still wets at night.  The design is great.  She loved wearing it.  The first night she wore it, no problems.  Every other time we've tried, she's woken up soaked, even with added layers.  I think it's all about the position she's sleeping in.  If she is on her side, or stomach, she's soaked.  I'm disappointed in them, but I think they'd be perfect for the right person.",3
"Boon Flair Pedestal Highchair with Pneumatic Lift,White/Orang","Difficult to describe how happy we've been with this chair over last two years. We can raise/lower the height as needed, we can keep it clean, the kid loves it, we can roll it wherever we need, and it looks great in our house.It is so far holding just fine against extreme usage (e.g kid letting us know he's finished eating by swaying violently). I guess actually that is just normal infant behaviour, but nice to know the chair is rock solid.We did have a minor problem with the brake when first purchased but the customer service mailed us a replacement part and it has worked flawlessly every since.",5
Personal Baby Assistant,"Horrible company to deal with. At first I loved this product bc it kept track of the time,amount etc of sleep, diapers, feeding. Able to get daily and weekly summaries. Was a big help. However, the company stopped the online program which uploaded the information to save and print, but didn't notify anyone. Then one day I changed the batteries....you have to make sure the unit is off...which is was...and ALL information from months was erased. I lost everything from the time my baby was born and now have no records of progression, sleep schedules etc. The company's answer was pretty much ""these things happen"".  It is now a discontinued product ( along with others from their company). I would not purchase anything from this company again.",1
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","This toy attaches perfectly to my Graco Lauren changing table. I've been using it since my son was 4 weeks old and it was great to see his motor skills develop as he begun to bat at the toys.

Unless you have an elongated bowl with miles between it and the tank, your days of lifting both lids are over. This little contraption prevents the seat from staying upright. Instead, it leaves it at just enough angle for you to THINK it will stay but the second you look away it slaps your business like a nun with a ruler. The only option is to leave the seat down and sometimes leave a bit of...overspray...for your wife to find.  Bad times. This stupid thing isn't worth it.",1

SaraBear Diaper Caddy- Green/Blue Striped,"I got this before my second son was born.  This is much better than the organizer that we had for my first son. The size is perfect to fit on top of our dresser/changing table right next to the changing pad.  The way the pockets are set up are ideal for everything you need.  There are big spaces for the diapers, wipes, and larger jars, but what's really great are the smaller pockets for the little things that can get lost in other organizers like gauze pads or q-tips.  And the fact that it's portable is awesome.  A little baby needs a new diaper every 2 hours (or more!) so to be able to bring everything I need with me wherever I go was fantastic.  I was a little apprehensive about the cost but this is so worth it.  I'm extremely happy I got this.",5
"Maclaren Universal Organizer, Black","I just recently received a 2013 Maclaren Volo in solid black as a gift. I really love it as a second stroller for public transportation & quick trips. I purchased this organizer in charcoal, the charcoal cup holder by Maclaren, and a black/charcoal Maclaren seat liner.I love this organizer as it doesn't cause the Volo to tip, & the stroller closes with this attached. I use the 2 bottle holders for my son's Pura Kika sippy cups, & they fit inside nicely (without the silicone sleeves). The middle pocket is perfect for my iPhone 5, and the large mesh bag is great for quick access to toys, books, hats, my wristlet, etc.In the bottom basket I store the rain cover & mosquito net, along with an A&A; swaddle blanket, a sweatshirt, & Skip Hop Pronto. I clip my KK water bottle to the handle of the stroller with a Built 24-30oz. bottle sling w/clip, & use the Maclaren cup holder for my iced coffee. I definitely recommend this organizer & the Maclaren cup holder for your stroller. They make the already fabulous Volo that much more convenient!",4

"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","My three year old is very tall, and I wanted a stroller to get in & out of Disneyworld w/ him.  This one claims it will really fit your kids until they're 50 pounds.  However, on the cover of the instructions, it says it's only meant for kids up to 40 inches tall, and the average American boy only weighs about 37 pounds at 40 inches tall.  ([...])I looked all over for dimensions of the stroller, and finally emailed The First Years for them.  Here's what they responded:Seat width: 11""Seat back height: 17""Seat pan length: 9""Folded dimensions: Height: 48"", Width: 12"", Depth: 11""TheThe First Years Ignite Stroller, Red Stripeseat is 3 inches wider and 1 inch taller, and the Ignite weighs 3 pounds more than the Jet.  Folded, the Ignite is 44"", 4 inches shorter.  However, the Ignite also sets 40"" as its maximum child height.  I plan to just ignore this, since I haven't seen any other reasonably priced strollers with a higher height limit.The longest stroller bag I could find was 44 inches long and it got mediocre ratings.  If you want a bag for checking this stroller, try a golf travel bag, which will probably be sturdier too.I've ordered a Jet (before I got the dimensions), but I haven't tried it yet.",4
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,"Lets just say that my kid uses brute force to do everything and he is also very persistent, but these Xtraguard 2 are holding on pretty well.

"Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, Green/Blue","I looked at a lot of different options before deciding on this chair for our baby and I LOVE it! Did I mention I love this chair? It is such a great product and so inexpensive, it seems almost to good to be true. We've had the chair for a little less than a year. It is easy to move - we take it to the grandparents for dinners often. It is so lightweight and small - it was really easy to take with us when we moved state to state and only had two small sedans. He can sit at the table with us if we want and doesn't take up a lot of room in our apartment. I would buy this thing over a highchair again in a heartbeat.",5
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"These are excellent trays. We have six that we use to make stage 1 and 2 baby food (so far). I've read some of the negative comments and here are some of my responses to them.1. Claim 1: food doesn't come out of tray/tray too rigid to twist.Frozen solid food comes out very easily. All you have to do is run the bottom cube part of the tray under water (or soak) for 20 seconds. Then slightly twist the tray and voila! You do not need to buy silicone trays. If you filled the trays above the portion walls for each cube, that's not a problem. When the food come out of the tray as a block, they break apart into cubes easily.2. Claim 2: Tray lids are not tight enough.They don't need to be tight. These trays are meant for freezing in portions, not long-term storage for a month. Freeze the food, then transfer the frozen cubes to labeled ziplock bags and reuse or wash/store the trays.3. Claim 3: Tray lids don't fit.I did not wash these in the dishwasher, which seems to be a major culprit of this complaint. A warm soapy water wash is quick and works great. If the tray lids become mis-shapen from the dishwasher, you can warm them and then put them on to mold them. They should come fitting well though and you don't need to put them in the dishwasher.4. Claim 4: Breastmilk storage issues.For breastmilk storage, baggies work best - let them freeze flat so that they defrost more evenly and quickly. Cubes won't defrost as fast and since breastmilk is delicate, you do not want to unevenly heat them.Hope your baby enjoys your delicious (and money saving!) homemade food!!!!!",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"I purchased this stroller to provide us with a more lightweight option to cart our eight month old around.  We love it!  Took it to the cabin this weekend and it was even able to handle the VERY rough and bumpy trails that go around the lake.  The sunshade provides the perfect amount of coverage and the cup holder and storage bag are great for packing up the little items that you don't want to get lost.  My only complaint is that the storage bin under the seat is very hard to access, but I knew that from reading the other reviews and to be honest, we aren't going to be using it for carting groceries  so it will be okay to hold a small bag.  Highly recommend this item!",5
Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper,"My 6 month old loves his activity center; hint if you play the Baby Einstein videos while your child is in this center you will have a very content baby (for those times you need a shower or 10 minutes alone).  My boy loved those door jam jumpers but we did not like the damage it made on our door jams so this activity center was the most logical purchase.  It is one short of 5 stars because he does not love it as much as the doorjam jumper (don't know why, it must not spring up as high).",4
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,It's so far so good for my 2 year old girl. It's easy for storage and portable. I can carry it with us while travelling,5
2M Premium Table Edge baby safety Guard Protector with Four Corner Cushion in --Green in U Shape M-HG002GU#,"I needed a way to prevent head injuries in my tornado shelter.  The metal sliding overhead door had many outcroppings that were easy to bang your head on.  Most of these consisted of brackets and mounts about 1/4 to 3/8&#34; thick.  I also used it on the corners of a vent.  The straight edge worked fine in this regard and the 3M tape had no problem keeping it in place.  I looked into baby table guards at walmart etc...but they were extremely overpriced.  This kit worked like a charm and allowed me to cushion every chain mount and roller bracket plus the vent.  I had about 3 feet of straight edge left over for a future need.  Some cutting was required to custom fit them to the various areas, a good pair of scissors makes short work of that.  The 3M tape worked very well.  After several months, everything is still mounted solid and protecting precious grey matter.",5
"Ju-Ju-Be Packabe Diaper Bag, Brown/Champagne","Love, love, love this diaper bag.  As a busy  mom of three, we are always running to activities and to the store.  This bag keeps my things very organized with the outside pockets to store items that you need to grab quickly.  The bag is deep inside to hold a lot of baby essentials.  It is made of a very, easy-to-clean fabric so it never looks grungy or dirty; the black and silver is great b/c it coordinates with almost everything I wear which is important since I wear it on my back a lot.  And the best feature for me is that I can carry it as a messenger bag or backpack so it won't slide off my shoulder when I'm bending down or fidgeting with the baby and other kids.  This is my second diaper bag for this child, and I've had numerous others with my other two children, and so far this is the best one I've ever purchased! Would recommend...worth the price b/c it will be the best and last one you'll ever buy!",5

"The Safe Sippy Cup, Blue","Wanted this to work so bad. I don't know how many stainless steal sippy cups I have tried at this point. To Many! Why is it so hard to find a stainless steal sippy cup that doesn't leak? I am mailing this one back due to it leaking. I ordered this cup and """"the insulated sippy"""" by Eco Vessel.  Tried them both today and the Safe Sippy leaks if you slightly shake it. The """"insulated sippy"""" by Eco Vessel isn't leaking at all. Can't say if either keeps liquids cold for long as I haven't gotten to test that yet.",1
Infant Optics Add-On Camera for DXR-5 2.4 Ghz Video Monitor (DXR-871),I ordered this product to extend the monitor and I enjoy it. The camera does what its suppose to. only complaint is not with the camera but rather the battery life of the monitor. Good product overall.,4

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought this for a friend of mine that is having twin boys. So far she loves it because it has come in handy with having twins.

"Graco Safe Seat Infant Car Seat, Portica","My son is 4 weeks old and has been enjoying his seat.  He isn't one bit fussy in it and it is realy easy to lock into place!  My only complaint is that it seems a bit on the heavy side.  Other than that, its great and my husband and I are happy with it.",5
"Teutonia T-Linx System, Topaz Green","Wow. OK, I don't want to come across as gushing uncontrollably, but Wow! The T-Linx system is hands-down the finest designer stroller I've ever laid eyes on. The T-Linx offers sleek and luxurious European engineering along with a highly functional component system. The system includes a top of the line stroller, infant car seat, infant car seat base, adapter and premium rain cover. Every operation I've attempted has been smooth and simple - this is a well-designed system! The stroller itself is amazingly  maneuverable. It's light and folds very compactly for ease of transportation.There are a variety of seating options for your child which can be changed quickly and easily (with one hand!), and the view point of the child can be reversed with almost no effort.The car seat is also operated easily with one hand. It comes with an adjustment dial and a level indicator so that you can position your child and the seat properly in the vehicle. The canopy rotates 180 and comes with a privacy shade. The whole system is luxuriously padded for baby's comfort and safety. According to the manufacturer, the car seat was ""co-engineered with the Graco SnugRide and rigorously tested for safety, including side impact testing to keep your baby secure from 5 to 35 pounds and up to 32 inches."" Not only does baby get to ride in luxury, but also in safety. Always a good thing!I am impressed, also, with the apparent strength of this system. Even though it is light, it seems to be very well built and I expect it to last (time will tell!).Compared to anything you might find at a big box shopping center, the T-Linx is phenomenally better. Light years ahead of the nearest competition. Smooth, sleek, easy to use. Very highly recommended!",5
KidCo Adhesive Mount Toilet Lock,Simple and effective! I installed two of them in 30 seconds!!! also what I love is that you can deactivate them; AND you can hide them under a decorative seat cover!!,5
"BabyKicks Premium Cloth Diaper Snap Closure, White","I have had the chance to try both the premium Babykicks diaper in Velcro and snaps! The premium diaper has a bamboo velour lining and a hemp insert with a pul outer cover. The bamboo is super soft and plush. These diapers have become my go to for outings and naps!The pros:1) super absorbent! This diaper is great for naps and will hold a lot of urine. It lasts for about 3 hours on my heavy wetter.2) trim! This diaper is very trim and allows my son to fit his normal size pants.3) good fit! The hip snaps allow the diaper to be well adjusted around my sons's chunky thighs.4) hemp! Organic hemp is awesome and has anti microbial properties which is so great to prevent rashes!The cons:1) the Velcro! The Velcro is similar to a grovia diaper but is much less sticky. Often it will come off the tab in the wash and fuzz will get stuck to it!2) lack of colors! There is a limited selection of colors to choose from which can be frustrating to someone who likes variety. I know that Babykicks would be an even larger part of my stash if they ever came out with more colors :)3) the fleece air gussets! Although they are great to allow air flow, it is the first place to leak when they hemp is full! Also, the fleece can become pilled rather quickly.4) stuffing a front pocket diaper! Although it is great to prevent blowouts from touching the insert they can be slightly difficult to stuff for larger hands.Overall, I am impressed by the premium diaper and would highly recommend it for daily use!",4
"Dream On Me 3&quot; Playard Mattress, White","the mattress fits the play yard very well. But it is the only good side. It is too soft and with a plastic cover,which means it does not breath at all.

"North States 3 in 1 Metal Superyard 2 Panel Extension, Taupe","This is a great sturdy gate. Built well. I gave it a 3 star rating because you can not take the panels apart. Must be used 2 panel extensions at a time. I needed 3, not 4...but that is my one and only gripe. This gate is fantastic. I use it not only to keep the kids away from areas in the house, but to keep my 3 large breed dogs in another room when we have company. I really like it and it does a great job.",3

"Boppy Pillow with Luxe Slipcover, Monkey","I have seven children and have had a new boppy with most of them. This is by far my favorite. I already had the new design that is roomier but this one seems even bigger, probably isn't but feels like it. The material is super soft and I love the little pockets. I can't prop my 9 week old on it yet because he was a preemie but it works great for nursing.",5
"OXO Tot On-the-Go Wipes Dispenser, Pink","On a list of all of the items a baby (or family with one) truly needs, ranked in order of importance, this would be somewhere near the bottom of the list. Most parents probably just throw a pack of wipes into the diaper bag. This adds an extra step: remove some of the wipes from a package (it won't fit all of them; too skinny) and throw them in this container. Refill as needed.Advantages of the product: it's a bit thinner than a full wipes package, and certainly smaller than any other full-sized hard shell around one. So it takes up less room. It's green (or pink, or blue; mine is green). A bonus, if you happen to like green (I do). It has a silicone strap that helps it attach to things. That's about it.Disadvantages: The silicone strap picks up everything (hair, dust, random bits of whatever). And the baby (now 11 months old) loves it. So it goes in her mouth. All the time. Gotta either remove it, or keep it clean. The claim that it has a ""Large button for easy, one-handed opening"" is a joke. You have to press *just right* on one little part of the button to pop the lid up. It's easier with two hands. That can be frustrating. It doesn't hold many wipes. Plan to refill it often, especially if you use more than one per cleaning. It doesn't seal all that well around the edges, so wipes will dry out over time if they're not used quickly. Still, if you're used to just using the plastic wrapper they come in (with that terrible ""sticker"" closure that quickly becomes ineffectual), this might be a step up. Maybe.Anyway, get it for yourself or a friend if they already have everything else they need. And like one of the colors offered. And want a thin hard case for wipes. And they don't use many, and like refilling containers often.Or just buy more diapers. Everyone with a baby needs more diapers.",3
"Bright Starts Walk-A-Bout Walker, Cute Frog",My Granddaughter loves this -- She really likes the rattle that moves around - she plays with it all the time -not so much the other stationary toy,5
"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","So here is the setup we had when we took this to Europe, Paris France to be exact (survived the cobblestones, YEAH!! biggest worry). Compact fold down made stowing the stroller manageable in the small European living quarters. Light enough that the mountains of stairways were not a huge problem on our vacation (with 2 adults carrying the stroller, bumping it up and down the stairs was a little hazardous). Our 9 month old was very comfortable in it, no problem falling asleep but to make her a little more comfortable, I &#34;popped&#34; the foot rest portion up by pushing underneath the material (it actually stays in place probably because her leg did not extend all the way down yet) to give her a more 'flat' surface to ly on. The zip pocket is big enough for her stroller blanket and a small toy or two. We splurged on the Rosk pouch carrier (another LOVE item) and kept the blanket nice and clean, Placed two of the king mighty stroller hooks(fits perfectly right at the base of the handle) to hold our diaper bag and shopping bags. The rain cover was a must for us, not just for the rain but it blocked a lot of the wind and coldness. We were able to fold up the stroller WITH the rain cover still attached to the canopy portion. Oh and the canopy, LOVE!! sturdy, big and the 'window' allowed me to catch her falling asleep a few times so I could quickly adjust the seating. The biggest bonus was we were actually able to bring this INTO (yes, INSIDE) some of the restaurants/cafes when she was napping. We had heard many stories about this being such a big NO NO over there. (we did try to choose bigger establishments that COULD accomodate us and crossed our fingers to see if they WOULD) We were NEVER refused the few times we had to do this with her napping in the stroller, they were so accomodating, nice and sympathetic!!Some cons/wish list for future improvements: Not sure if this is airline specific (air tahiti) but we gate checked the stroller only to have to pick it up at luggage because it was too 'bulky' according to airline. Not a big deal since I ergoed her but caused some confusion when we landed and was waiting for the stroller.  Wish the handle could optionally extend out a little and change angles for comfort. I'm 5'2&#34; but the long walks made me wish I could position my arm and hand differently after a while.. A little unstable when folded and standing, it has to be in a certain position or it will fall over. Not crazy about the handle touching the ground when folded to stand stroller up. This might just be my daughter's preference but having the seat more upright would be wonderful, I often catch her leaning forward instead of resting her head against the head rest to sit up straight. I keep wanting to bring along a small pillow to place behind her but keep forgetting and it'll be one more thing I have to travel with that would be nice not to need. Again all of this are not deal breakers but would be NICE to have :)",5

"Dream On Me Liberty Collection 3 Drawer Changing Table, Cherry","I'm one who is always skeptical of negative reviews and usually I'll purchase something anyway and everything turns out fine, however, we definitely got burned on this one; I should have listened! I opened the box to nearly every piece being scratched/chipped/gouged right out of the packaging, and the box was in decent shape. I believe the handling and packaging of the material itself leads to lots of damage, and shipping only makes it worse. Out of all the ""wood"" pieces, we ended up with about 3 different colors total, NOT just espresso like described. I'm so dissatisfied with this product, it's a total waste of $150 + shipping cost. If all pieces were in good condition, I believe it would be a nice solid piece, however you've only got a 1 in 1,000,000,000,000 chance of that happening it seems. Buyer beware!!!",1
"Nuby 3-D Snack Keeper, Monster",Every time my kid uses this he can't stick his hand in and get the snacks out.

100% Waterproof Quilted Crib Mattress Pad - 28 x 52,"I was disappointed b/c I didn't read anywhere when buying that it was just a sheet to lay on top of the mattress so it gets bunched up under the sheet a lot.  I may sew a wrap-around for it.  Other than that, it meets the requirements of being leak proof.",4

NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"No matter what frequency we tried, this monitor beeped in our house anytime someone walked in front of either the transmitter or the receiver, as well as anytime our 900 mhz phone got near it or we received a call.  This is not a good thing for new Moms who are trying to get a few minutes of sleep!!  Also, when we dialed the phone, you could hear the dialing through the monitor.Also, we had problems with the rechargable battery, it would die after being unplugged for only 30 minutes.The nice thing about this monitor is that when it is not beeping, it is very quiet.  There was no static whatsoever.",2
Soothie Pacifier Attacher - Blue Penguin with Igloo Clip,"The soothie pacifier clip makes the pacifier too heavy and large so, it either falls out of my son's mouth or he hits it out with his hand. The clip easily comes off, also. I got a Mam pacifier clip and that works much better.  You just take the plastic end off the Mam clip and put the end of the ribbon through a hole in the soothie pacifier and the ribbon Velcros to itself.",1
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"Bought this based on the price and number of positive reviews. Functionality is pretty straight forward and we really liked the unit initially. My son is now 6 months old and each night it's become an increasingly ridiculous joke trying to get the monitor to connect to the camera. My wife and I will toss the unit back and forth, each restarting and shutting the monitor off hoping it will connect this time.I've shut down all electronics, wireless routers, and any potential items of interference and the unit still experiences the same problem. There's no rhyme or reason with how it connects either. You can be literally holding it next to the camera and it won't connect or across the house in the basement and it will. At this point we'll be buying another unit to replace it before I throw this one against the wall in frustration.",1
Fisher-Price Aquarium Take-Along Swing,"Space is tight in our home, so this swing is perfect.  I love that I can move it from room to room.  I bring it into the bathroom to occupy my son while I shower.  He usually falls asleep and doesn't wake up until I've showered and dressed.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because my in-laws have a full-size swing and my son seems to like not being so low to the ground in their swing.",4
Britax B-Safe Infant Car Seat Extra Base,"I've never been a fan of the big brick and mortar stores. But when faced with having to get a secondary one of these for our second car, Amazon pulls through.The base is easy to install, feels secure enough (see con), and the Britax cradle just snaps right in.Con - well, as secure that it may seem to hold the cradle, I've found that its lack of support from a side impact, troubling. Even when fully tightened and inspected by our local fire department; the base still can slide left to right easily. I suppose, this may be a design thing to help displace any shock from a side impact, but I didn't design it so I don't have an answer for you.Otherwise, it served its function.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Based on a number of reviews in prominent magazines and literature, we decided to go with the Avent bottles. A pity I did not think of having a look on Amazon. These bottles leak bad. Tight or loose, wet or dry, old or new does not matter. Unfortunately we are stuck with the investment and are just being carefull when using. Replacing them with others are not an option. DO NOT BUY!",1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","So comfortable... but takes up a ton of space in a queen bed! My husband has been relegated to a third of the bed... but he likes sleeping with his back to the pillow for support for him!Really supports me and helps with an expanding tummy.  Wish it came with more washable covers, and it does lose some of its shape unless you repeatedly turn it and plump it daily! Overall summary: its a great buy and I don't intend on giving it up after the birth without a fight!!",4
"Nurtria BPA Free Sippy Cups, Pink, 7 Ounce, 6-Count","I was looking for cups for my two small children so they could practice drinking out of a real cup at dinner, but I could put the lid on it for when it was time to leave the table. These are perfect. The others I tried, the top would pop off, leaving an insane mess as the entire contents of the cups ended up on the floor and my children. These lids won't pop off for your kids, but are not impossible to remove for mommy and daddy. The cups are a bit small, but honestly, when my kids are still perfecting the art of drinking without a lid, I don't want a huge cup to practice with.",5
"Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat, Elixer","For our second child we bought this car seat (previously had a Graco) to fit into the matching Sit N Stand double stroller.  Wish I found another seat that also fits, even if it won't be the same color.  Great safety ratings, the triangle handle looks weird but I thought was comfortable, and easy to clean.  However, it is very difficult to move the handle back (which you're supposed to do for safety) once you put the baby in the car.  It takes a few tries to get it to move and is a real hassle.  The strap length isn't very long either and my baby only weighs 13 pounds.I agree with other reviewers and would not buy this again despite the convenience of fitting well with my new carriage by the same brand (which I love and highly recommend).",2
Thirty One Organizing Utility Tote Big Dot,"I am a mom and bought this bag to carry stuff for my kids. I have a 2 and 4 year old. I can carry diapers, wipes, change of clothes, small cosmetic bag, snacks, drinks, my cell phone, keys, wallet and still have room to throw in sweatshirts or toys. There are 8 outside pockets which is very handy for the little stuff. No digging for keys, phone, or tissues.  I also like the black and white goes with everything.  Great bag would highly recommend it.",4

Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Our daughter loves the toy, but the song it plays is most definitely NOT ""If you're happy and you know it clap your hands."" Instead it's ""Llorando se Fue"", which most people know better for having been sampled in Jennifer Lopez's song ""On the floor"". Given that the manufacturers programmed in the original song rather than the JLo version it's marginally more age-appropriate, I suppose.Youtube link to the original: [...]",3

"Dabbawalla Backpack, The Fast Track","The product looks nice and I am happy that it is PVC free. However the product was stated to have dimensions of 14 x 14 x 6.  Because of this I had expected it to be big enough to easily hold a standard 8 1/2"" x 11"" notebook even with the rounding that occurs at the top of most backpacks. I am very disappointed that a standard notebook barely fits and in some cases the backpack may cause the corners to bend. It might just be functional for its intended use as a backpack for pre-school and kindergarten.On physical inspection, the interior measurements of the backpack without contorting it are 10""w x 11 1/2""w (at center) x 6"".  To get those 14"" dimensions, I needed to flatten, stretch, or otherwise distort it well beyond its natural shape. Counting the top loop at its fullest extent is also useful to get that 14"" height. Amazingly, the 6"" depth appears to be accurate.In terms of quality, the materials and sewing looks adequate. I can see how it would be possible for small objects to fall out through the small gaps where the back straps go through the bottom of the pack.",3
"Yellow Chevron Lovey, For entertainment, comfort and sensory Play, Ribbons Sewn Shut Into Tabs","This yellow chevron lovey is absolutely adorable, and perfect colors for our baby girl's nursery. She sleeps with it every night with the soft minky fabric next to her cheek. She plays with the ribbon tabs as she falls asleep. Even when she's awake, she chews on the soft fabric and tabs, which is fine because these wash so nicely!! The link loop clips conveniently to the stroller, baby carrier, etc, which is great so it never falls on the floor. The colors, size, tabs, and fabrics are absolutely wonderful. We love Baby Jack Blankets :)",5

Kidco Door Knob Lock - Clear - 2,Yet another babyproofing design that assumes that we all live in houses that were built in the last 30 years.

Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,"This is a REALLY cool pad - just enough 'give' to keep your baby comfy while you're changing him/her.

"Dreambaby Children at Play Sign, Orange","If your kids love to play and you love your kids, this is a must!  This sign is pretty large, bright, and very noticeable.  I bought two of them, one for each side of our front yard.  And since it has a storage compartment, you can ensure that the wind won't blow these away simply by putting an object inside.  Most people like to speed, and most people don't like to hit kids.  This serves as a fair warning, and unless you live on a one-way street I would definitely recommend getting two!",5

Petunia Pickle Bottom Boxy Backpack Diaper Bag (Majestic Murano),"I am a mom of two boys, a three year old and a 2 month old and this is by far my favorite diaper bag yet. It is stylish but also highly functional. I love that backpack option because as a mom of two, I normally need one hand for the carseat or stroller and the other to hold on to my three year old. I also love that the entire bag can just be wiped clean. There are two pockets on the inside for bottles which are easy to get to when you need a bottle ASAP. In the inside there is a hook for your keys and a tiny zipper pocket so you can keep your wallet or other small items from getting lost in the bag. In the front of the bag is a fold out diaper changing pad which is really convenient. I do wish there was a small pocket in the back for an iPad or for papers, but other than that I have no complaints on this bag at all! LOVE IT!",5

"Sunshine Kids Shade Maker Canopy For Strollers, Black","We have the bugaboo chameleon, which we love, except the sun shade isn't long enough to shade our child's face most of the time, and if we pull the shade all the way down, she can't see. We tried getting her to wear a sun hat, but we all know how long kids keep hats on. We also tried hanging a light blanket over the edge and the wind just blew it off. I was so sick of flipping the sun shade back and forth on what were supposed to be leisurely strolls, that I went searching for an alternate. I put this sun shade on the minute it arrived and it worked like a charm! Easy to attach, adjustable, and SUPER light. The only negative is you can't fold it back when taking the child in and out, but it's easily bendable, so it's easy to just nudge it back with your shoulder. Plus, since it twist and folds in a snap, and it's so easy to take on and off, it's not really a huge negative in my mind. I can actually do long strolls without constantly having to check if the sun is blazing down on my child's face. Another plus is that it also fits on our light travel stroller, which is perfect for trips this summer. It has great side pockets for a light wallet, chap stick, keys or sunglasses. So great, because I don't have to go fishing around the stroller bag for small items anymore! It would also fit a cell phone, but because of reports about radiation and cell phones, I wouldn't suggest it. I keep my cell under the stroller in a bag and away from her brain. I find myself constantly asking why bugaboo doesn't just make their sun shade exactly like this one?!",5

I read the reviews for the new Sea Turtle and so I decided on this one that stated there were more stars on it.  My son loves it.  No matter which color you pick out on the site the turtle changes colors with a push of a button to blue, amber, or green.",5
"Contours Optima Tandem Stroller, Hudson","We used this stroller for Disneyland. It was great! It is easy to push and has a big storage area underneath. We also loved switching the seats around so our kids could face different directions. We liked this much better than a sit n stand, because both kids got to take naps if needed. The only cons would be that every time you fold up the stroller, you have to detach the seats first. They are easy to detach, just a hassle when you are getting in and out of the tram at Disneyland. On the other hand, this is one of the smoothest rides for a double stroller, easy steering. Glad we bought!",4
"NoJo NoJo Plum Dandy Wall Decals, Purple","I love the way these decals look on the wall in my daughter's room and I think there was just the right amount for the small room we decorated, but we had a lot of trouble getting them to stay on the wall. We ended up using Scotch tape on the back of most of them and that seemed to do the trick",4
Mommy's Helper Slide Latch,"I bought these specifically for our entertainment/tv stand and that is the cabinet it DOES NOT work with (see pictures), but it is GREAT with the right kind of cabinet that has handles rather than round knobs - easy to open and close (I have it on our kitchen island cabinet and our microwave cart) for an adult but seems great to keep a little one out (our son is 7 months and has been crawling EVERYWHERE for the past few weeks but isn't opening cabinets YET). I would buy it again, just not for a cabinet with round, smaller knobs.",4
"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","My 1 mo. daughter is breast feed but we supplement her with 1 bottle at night. We use these DR Brown wide bottles and she has little if any spit up, no colic and very little if any gas! I think they work wonderful. And the great thing is, I started using this in the hospital (she was in special care for 5 days) and to this day we have NO NIPPLE CONFUSION!!!  I cant say enough about these bottles. Oh, and no need to buy the 4 oz bottles, theses work great for little amounts or big. One of our best baby purchases!",5
"Baby Jogger City Versa Stroller,  Black","I love this stroller! I've been using it with my 5 month old, with the seat facing me and in the reclined position. BJ states it's for 6 months and up. I use a head and body support to keep her from sliding around. I bought the city mini GT before she was born And wish I had just gone with the versa to begin with. It has a huge storage basket, strolls through the neighborhood very smoothly, and is not too heavy. My car seat, the Graco snugride 35 LX does not have a compatible adapter to use with the Versa, but there are other seats and adapters that work to use it as a frame stroller too. I bought the silver and love the color!",5
"Peg-Perego Skate Stroller System, Java","Purchased this stroller for our first baby in the Black Step. So far, we have only used the bassinet attachment because he is only 5 weeks old. We also own the matching car seat and love that as well. This stroller is totally convertable, we won't have to buy another stroller for years! Easy to use...great look...wouldn't have it any other way!",5
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I used this extension on an already existing Superyard XT.  It takes a little extra strength to join together, but it locks in nice and extended the smaller ""pen"" to a nice size.",5
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","Arrived in a nice small pouch, as it can be rolled into a smaller size for storage.Re-usable, which is GREAT! But we have yet to see how well it holds up to long-term use.Keeps out harsh sunlight and glare as promised.Works well.",4
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units,Worked great when it worked but the transmitter failed in less than a year.  I would not purchase this one again.,2
"Kids Line Dena Happi Tree Lamp Base and Shade, Pink","This lamp matches the rest of her room. It is totally cute and good quality. Our lamp seems to lean back a bit instead of totally upright, not sure if it is supposed to do that, but regardless, it functions as it should and is adorable!",5
"Zoli Gummy Sticks Baby Gum Massagers, Green/Orange","These are the second set of these teethers we have bought for our two year old son. We still have the first set, but wanted more to have around. He pretty much has these in his mouth all day long since he has been teething (2 year molars). They reach to the back of his mouth without gagging him and seem to be safe since the guard only allows it to go so far in to his mouth. The silicone is very durable; it has held up to the constant gnawing for the last several months with no sign of wear and tear. They have definitely become the go-to for teething. Also very easy to clean and sanitize.",5
Fitted Insect/Bug Netting For Infant Carrier,This works well as a barrier for insects and also for people who want to touch your baby.  We use this daily on our walks.,5
"Ulubulu Universal Pacifier Clip, Oliver Owl","Look, I'm all about cute baby products, and this one is very cute.  However, I think that the utmost quality of all baby products should be SAFETY, and this product does not seem safe.  The clip itself is made of metal that is quite sharp and easy for baby to cut him/herself on.  I returned this item.  I don't recommend it at all.",1
McKenzie Kids Messenger Bag Brown/Aqua,"We love this bag for quick trips- like to the grocery store, errand running, day trips, etc. Its small enough to not weigh you down but large enough for 4-6 nb diapers, wipes, change of clothes, burp clothes, cover up. Nice zippered compartments. Like the front compartment for my wallet, keys, and cell phones. I have a droid so that doesn't fit in the cell phone pocket on the strap...meant for a smaller cell. It is slightly tough to get in and out of the bag as it doesn't open up extremely wide but for a quick diaper change, it works great. Slings over your shoulder and doesn't get in the way. Great material. Our 3 week old has already christened it and it wipes clean perfectly. Definitely recommend this bag!",5
"JJ Cole Car Seat Canopy, Aqua Drops",Love this canopy!  It keeps the baby covered from coughs and sneezes. It also keeps people from reaching in and waking baby up.,5
"Evenflo Big Kid High Back SI Car Seat Booster, Alexa","Just what we wanted. Was going to buy from local walmart, but didnt have the right colors nor would they match their own price. Insead I got on here, got what I wanted, cheaper price and in my hand in 2 days",5
Medela One-Piece Breastshield w/ Valve and Membrane,This breast shield does its job. I just wish they still made the soft shields as those were so much more comfortable for me.,4
Combi Counterpart Tandem Stroller Mango,I love this stoller. It is nice & easy to handle. I have a 3 year old & a newborn on the way. My 3 year old son loves riding in it already. This stroller has everything. It is easy to fold. It is not heavy at all compared to the other doubles out there. It has nice cushions. The front seat reclines & the back seat goes flat for a newborn. I do find the middle wheels to be annoying but not really a problem. I can reverse just fine with it. I have no problems with this stroller. I highly recommend it.,5
Potty Time Potty Watch - Blue,"This product is an amazing creation, however more time needs to go into the development. it worked for the first week, then needed a new battery and was never working properly again. Even after an exchange it was a poor product.",2
"Moby Wrap UV SPF 50+ 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Sand","This wrap was waiting for me when I came home from the hospital from my surgery. The surgery was on my stomach, and my baby is pretty fussy... So I was worrying how I was going to carry him. Ironically my friend who sent it just wanted me to have two hands, but the wrap was a Godsend because I could barely carry my baby and he was used to the constant contact with mommy.The wrap itself doesn't have a pressure point. After my surgery I didn't want to take pain meds so I could still breastfeed, and the carbon dioxide had built up in my body and concentrated in my shoulders (any of you that have had surgery will know the pain I'm talking about). The wrap didn't put any pressure on my shoulders, nor on my back, or my stomach... It was easier to put the wrap on and have him in there than to carry him around, and it didn't cause me pain. After my surgery I wore this wrap all day long except when I was sleeping because it was so wonderful.My baby has gas problems. If he is not face-up after he eats for at least an hour he will wake up crying in pain because he has gas trapped inside of him. It's easier to carry him and do what needs to be done, burping him when he needs, than setting him down and him waking up and being in pain. If you have a fussy baby, this wrap is perfect. The tightness of him against me and the motion of me walking or doing whatever puts him to sleep, and enables me to do what I need to do.the ""third"" panel of cloth that comes up over his bottom also doubles as a pocket for me, I put my keys or wallet or cell phone in it, especially when I'm on the go and just have to run into the grocery store for two seconds. I just leave the diaper bag behind in the car and go wherever hands free. For longer days, it's great because it's not an extra something I have to tote around. When he's not in it I wear it anyways or I fold it up and put it in my diaper bag-- it fits into my diaper bag and takes up minimal space considering it's something I carry my baby in.For those reviewers that say the wrap drags on the floor... goodness gracious, wrap it around your body another time, and then knot it... thought that was common sense... Also, if you are complaining your baby slumps in the wrap, start the wrap higher and make it tighter. Then as he grows older make the ""third"" panel lower (on your body). But you should have to stretch the wrap to put your baby in unless you want it looser.NO metal, will go through metal detectors... good for court dates, traveling.ooh, the whole falls on the floor bit.. you hold it as you wrap it around  your body and make folds, like when wrapping a sari. if you are interested look up ""how to wrap a sari"" on youtube. Perhaps I'll post a video one day. It takes me literally less than 15 seconds to wrap my moby... once u get used to it, it's a cinch.  Promise.One last thing... I live in the desert (New Mexico) and it gets extremely hot here (like over 100 degrees on average in summertime)... but I still wear it outside and he just sleeps in it. I do notice it is a bit warmer on my body but he is fine and I don't mind it, the fabric is really breathable.This wrap is a must have for moms that have to run around and do a lot of errands, or don't stay home a lot and only have a certain amount of time to get things done (even when they are home). It enables me to have the time I need with my baby and take care of him while meeting the other requirements I have as well.",5
Summerside Activity Table with 2 Drawers - Oak,"This table is beautiful and well made.  It was easy to put together (of course my husband put it together, but it looked easy).  The kids love it.  My son actually likes putting his train stuff back in his bin.  It's a wonderful addition to our family room.",5
Potty Time Potty Watch - Blue,The first one worked nicely for about 2 weeks. Then the battery died. Unfortunately we had the old version. It was glued together. IE you can not change the battery. We contacted customer support @ Potty Time inc. They sent us a new watch free of charge. Only it was defective. The screen is angled and only displays when you hit the button.A little disappointed I forced open the first one only to find that it was all rusted out from water via hand washing. This is a great idea that is red flagged by manufacturing defects. Great customer support only goes so far. Its like the newest designed Xbox 360 still has a 50% failure rating. Who wants to buy that?If you cant make it water resistant put a Velcro strap on it. Its not easy putting it on or taking it off.If you get one that works take it off to wash their hands.,2
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","I need a changing pad cover that's 34"" long, and in the description online it says 34"".  However, when I received it in the mail, the package says 32"".  That won't work for my changing pad, so I'm returning it.",1
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black",So I went though the reviews about this stroller and I had pretty low expectations of it. I ordered this for my trip to Disney in August and I think it will do great! And my 2 year old is comfortable in it.my husband and i don't have to break my back bending over pushing it..and he is 6'6&#34;... Highly recommended if you are looking for something light weight  and that rides smoothly.:-),5
"Satsuma Designs Organic Wash Cloths and Wipes 5 Pack, White","I guess I'm not sure what all the fuss is about these. They cost A LOT for what they are, but because of the rave reviews, I bought them for our newborn. They are, indeed, soft, but they are small and not anything particularly special. We have wash cloths from target that were a fraction of the cost and work just as well. If you're looking to splurge on your new baby, I wouldn't recommend you do so on these, but if you have money to blow, go for it. Definitely nice that they are organic, but they're not life changing by any means.",3
Milkies Milk-Saver (Two Packs),Work as designed for collect milk while breast feeding. It is bigger than i thought but works. The price in my oppinion is to high knowing that you only need one a time and the Phillips comfort brest shells are smaller and cheaper and works the same way. Over all is a good product and my wife still use it at home while  on the run is the Phillips comfort shells what she used.,4

"Nuby 2 Count Super Spout Easy Gripper, Colors May Vary, 10 Ounce",For some reason these are my daughters absolute favorite cups. She has loved nearly every kind of sippy cup from Nuby. I think she loves that it is a squishy top so she can bite down on it when she is teething and it feels good on her gums. It is by far the easiest for her to drink out of. The only complaint that I have is that it can be difficult to get the top part clean because of all of the dips and curves. I usually have to replace them every few months because the squishy part starts to get a little gross. Luckily these are inexpensive and get used everyday!,4
Naturepedic CH41 No Compromise Organic Cotton Changing Pad,"I bought this because of the all-naturalness, no chemicals, etc.  I love it for that.  Otherwise, it's a changing pad - it does what it's supposed to!",5
Kiinde Kozii,The warmer appears to take longer than the recommended times in the instructions to warm up bottles. I think this warmer would be ideal during later stages of feedings when baby has more of a routine but is difficult to use when you have to wait 6+ mins for a small bottle to heat up for late night feedings of infants whom are not on any set schedules.,3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"I recently bought this for my 2 month old baby girl for Christmas. The first thing that captivated her was the lights and music. It has three settings for sounds and lights. The first setting is just music and lights that plays for 20 minutes, the second setting is rainforest sounds and lights that also plays for 20 minutes the lights blink differently for the two settings. The third setting is baby activated meaning it will light up and play music when the mobile holding the butterflies is moved. It also has two settings for sound volume. It comes with five toys that can be moved around to different areas. All toys have a different way for baby to interact. The mat itself is very colorful, the sun has little ribbons for baby to interact with and the cats tail is movable. The leaf at the base of the giraffe has crinkle for extra sound and texture. There are also soft loops on the edges of the mat to hook the toys to. Set up was extremely easy and quick.The only pet peeve I have with the toy is that the mobile is high up. Baby would have to be really big to swipe at it to get it moving.Pros: Lots of toys with ability to move them to different locations.Easy to put togetherLots of interactive play (all toys can be played with differently)Bright colors with friendly charactersCons: The mobile is too high up for a baby to really play with it.Overall a great buy, though a bit to the expensive side.  It was a bit overwhelming for her at first but as she has continued to use it she plays more and more. Even my older kids have been playing with this mat so I see it being used for a long time.",4

However, it got too beat up and my back up diaper bag had no stroller clips, so I was in search of a way to attach the bag easily to our large Graco stroller. These clips were easy to install and work great with our diaper bag and stroller. I am very happy with the purchase and it makes bringing the diaper bag places so much easier!",5
GEENNY Musical Mobile For Boutique Horse Cowboy 13 PCS Crib Bedding Set,"This mobile matched great with the Boutique Horse Cowboy Crib Bedding Set and my son loved the music, but the colors just aren't bright enough for a baby in my opinion. My son's entire nursery was designed to match this cowboy theme and it is too cute, but I think baby's respond more to brighter colors. But the mobile worked great and looked great with the theme. Would recommend the mobile to go along with the bedding set.",4
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","We began using this on the carseat when my son was 3 months old, and we're still using it now that he's almost 9 months.  It keeps him entertained on short and long car trips.  He loves pulling the handle to make the flower spin.",5
Boon Frog Pod,"Own the suction cup model from Target. Does NOT stay on walls. We traded in the screw in model, because we didn't want to drill into drywall above shower (that's how you get moisture problems) or into the enclosure (ruining it), for the suction cup model. It just DOES NOT hold the weight with any toys in it.Very cute, love the look. Sadly, pass on this.",2
Dex Products Universal Safe Sleeper Bed Rail,"I am not sure whatever happened to the bedrails I used for my son.  Put together, extend arms, put under mattress, kid stayed in bed.  In an effort to make either better or safer they have only created headaches and problems.Putting together was simple, however, securing under a mattress was horrible.  I had to secure this under a queen mattress for my granddaughter to sleep over.  Very difficult could not do alone and then it wasn't any better than the bedrails I used for my son.They should simply have kept the arms longer and forget the securing under the mattress on the other side of the bed.",3

"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","This bra cut my pumping time in half! And that's a lot when I work full time and want to keep my baby on breastmilk only. I love it!

"Itzy Ritzy Lunch Happened Bento Lunch Box, Rock Star","The concept is awesome but my 5 year old has a hard time getting the top compartment open thus I can not utilize it for extra lunch items.

Wheelie Junior Travel Bag- Black,"We needed a way to easily travel with our Graco Play Yard to Ireland.  This little bag did the job perfectly.  After flying to and from Ireland as a checked bag, being transported to three different hotels, and an additional trip to NH this bag is like new.  There is no wear and tear on the bag, it looks great and is still very much in one piece.  As others have said there is lots of room in the bag for more than just the playyard.  On our way to Ireland I put the playyard in, all our toiletries, a fleece baby blanket, a stuffed animal, and a sleepsack and all fit no problem.  The front pocket is perfect for books.  The only way this bag could be better would be if it were easier to roll.  You have to be careful rolling it because it is so long it often tips over to one side and falls off the wheels. I would definitely buy this bag again.  Also it fit within Delta Airline's checked baggage sizes.",5

Circo Sports Valance - 54&quot;x 15&quot;,I was very happy with the product I received. It came in the original packaging and was just what I was looking for!,5
Simplisse Double Electric Breastfeeding Companion,"Before I bought my Simplisse pump, I had been using traditional pump and had a HORRIBLE experience. I was getting milk, but it was so painful that it hurt to pump and nurse. So I bought the Simplisse. I was prepared for the transition phase from using a traditional pump as they tell you about. I tried the pump one week with no luck so I called customer service. I was put in contact with Kim who was EXTREMELY helpful. They overnighted the parts I needed and were so friendly and helpful. Now I'm getting the same amount of milk I was before with my old pump but without the tugging, pinching, pulling and tissue damage. (I was getting bruises and stretch marks from my other pump.) The Simplisse does not have small breast cups available which concerned me because that was part of the problem with my old pump. But I didn't need it. The design of the Simplisse is very accomadating to all breast sizes. I HIGHLY recommend this product and all the products Simplisse has on the market.",5
KidCo Magnet Lock Starter Set,"the locks are great (super easy to install and strong too), and the key is awesome. we bought 2 keys, one for the bathroom and one for the kitchen. didn't even need to use the mount piece for the key since the key sticks very firmly to the fridge and medicine cabinet with its magnet. very nice.",4
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn","If your baby likes to be swaddled, these are fantastic because you don't have to worry about them coming undone in the middle of the night and pulling the blanket over their face, making them too tight to prevent them coming undone,  the blanket being the wrong size, etc...  My daughter started sleeping through the night at about 6 weeks as long as she was swaddled (my other 2 kids HATED being swaddled).  Needless to say I wasn't the best swaddler with a blanket and these have been a lifesaver.  Definitely recommend these for any parent/grandparent!",5

Bright Starts Peek-A-Zoom Toy,"This toy is easy and big enough for a crawling baby to push around, but also great for fine motor skills.  The wheels push easily, the pop-ups work well and are easy for an older baby to learn, the bright colors are attractive, and the thing makes its own airplane noises--so what more do you need?",5
Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen,"In 2009, this model would not navigate two rooms at the same time... you would have to go to the menu and switch between cams to hear what is going on in each room.  It would not flip back and forth every 8 seconds and would not split screen.  The newer model offers the 8 second flip between rooms (which is nice at night and when the kiddos are napping at the same time).  It also has the split screen option if you are uncomfortable with the 8 second delay and want constant monitoring of both.  I have the older model (purchased in 2009).  I have two cams and one monitor...  (and been VERY happy with my purchase).  The only downfall is that the batteries have worn down (but heck... it's been three years!).  My routine is that I plug it in at night beside the bed and when my son naps in the afternoon, it will last up to 4 hours but will be on it's last legs by the time we put him down at night so we have to plug in as soon as we put him down.  For a monitor bought so long ago (three years ago), I am not complaining... batteries lose their power- especially this type of battery.  That's how they keep costs down (I assume).  The durability and life of the monitor and all the other pros listed here outweigh the fact the battery loses its power over time.  Other monitors just don't compare in my opinion for the price.We are expecting another in August and plan to keep the monitor on our new baby over night and put just a cheapy fisher price sound monitor in my sons room (along with the extra cam we have for this video monitor)... if we hear him, we can still switch the cam over to his room by going through the menu option to see what is going on.  NOTE**** The old cams won't integrate with the new monitors unfortunately.  I called Summer to see if we could just purchase a new monitor and keep our current cams (and benefit from the newer technology and features) but the old cams won't work with the newer monitors.  They probably do this on purpose to get you to buy all parts new- like most other things. lol  If you are a repeat customer of Summer... they will offer you a steller price on replacing all... (to buy the new monitor with two cams, they would sell me this unit direct for $239.98 through their Loyalty program).  That is cheaper than ANY store online out there.  I think we can get by with what we have though and just use the cheapy sound monitor for my son in conjunction with this one... he is three and probably won't need one for much longer.Bottom line-  I am still happy with my monitor! We put a little piece of black electrical tape over the LED light on the cam and wala- no bright light.  Quick fix.  They are pretty slow for not resolving this issue in the 3 or 4 years they have had this video cam out.  Not sure why they think the baby needs a bright green spotlight!  LOL  Sound quality is awesome... durability- awesome, picture quality, awesome, pan features, awesome (don't go with a stationary model... you will need to pan as they get older and BIGGER).  This is the right cam to get... the Baby Touch monitor is glitchy (from the million reviews I have scanned over)... it looks cooler, but there are way more complaints on it and I wouldn't trust it.  This is a proven cam and has worked wonderfully for three years!  I hope this helps those trying to make a decision (I have a broadband card (wiFi) connection in my house as well and we have had no problems).  The range is EXCEPTIONAL!!!  We mow our 2.5 acres and get a signal over 250 feet away. If you go with this one, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",4

"Go Mama Go Designs Reversible Teething Guard, Cream/Chocolate, 52&quot; X 12&quot;","I looked at many crib teething guards before I purchased this one.  It was easy to put on, it is soft and well padded.  I bought the neutral chocolate/cream and it is perfect for the crib. I didn't want something standing out - we have enough colors in the crib/room already.  Since putting this on the crib rails, I can have my baby jump in the crib, cling to the edge without wondering when he will bump his head or teeth again or try to chew on the crib.",5
"Munchkin Pacifier Clip, Colors May Vary","We use soothies pacifiers so the clip part is what we attach to the rubber handle of the paci, so the other end is the Velcro and I have no clue what you'd attach that to on the baby or in the stroller.  it should really have clips on both ends.",2

I can accommodate all the items require for a day out with my 14 months old baby.  It comes with a separate pocket in the front to put wallet and whatever mom needs. Inside has a sippy cup holder which is insulated,  and another pocket for little things. I can pack neatly 6 to 8 diapers, a change of clothes, socks, wipes, a small blanket, sippy cup, and a  ziplock bag with snacks among other things. The straps are long enough to wear cross body, and it doesn't feel heavy at all.",5
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","I really wanted to love my Britax B-ready but after 4 months, it is already looking very old and beat up.

"RECARO Performance BOOSTER High Back Booster Car Seat, Vibe","I bought 2 of these, one for my 7 1/2 yr old daughter, and also my 3 1/2 yr old daughter.  For both kids, and they are both average size to a little bigger for their age, the Recaro fits perfectly.  After doing so much comparison online and instore, this brand truly was the most comfy.  the cupholders are nice, and things dont go flying off (that was a prob with our old booster).  The cupholders also are stationary (our old booster had them so they slide in and out) - the sliding was a problem b/c once you sit on the booster, your weight makes it hard to pull out the holders....with the Recaro its just there, and the rubber lining comes off so its easy to clean or dump any garbage the kids have put there!  ALso, the sides are very plus, makes me feel very good about their safety.  the headread is very secure.  ANd it has a latch, so if 1 or none of my kids are in the car, I dont have to worry about the boosters flying around in case of an accident. The only reason this got a 4 instead of 5 star is that its very BIG.  I have a Toyota Sienna van, so these 2 sit in the big captain chairs.  But I dont think someone could sit in the middle , and Im not sure if these would fit in the 3rd row....?  We havent had to worry about that yet, so for now, I'm happy with these boosters!  THe girls love them too!  We have the purple and the blue ones.",4
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,"My son LOVES this aquarium. LOVES LOVES LOVES it! My only complaint is that the water in it slowly evaporates. I've had it for a little over a year and some of the fish are now starting to be """"on land!"""" I hope this newer version is more sealed then the old one.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I can't say enough good things about the Champ.  For my first son we had the Diaper Genie - but it didn't do the trick. (too $$ and too difficult to handle).For son #2, I read the reviews and decided to give this one a try.  I still love it!  My son (who is now 3+ years old) is finally getting potty trained, but we still use it to hold the ""nightie night dypes""...  We've been using it for 3+ years and it is still going strong.According to the reviews, I was careful to wrap the diapers before putting them in - which we had to do for the Genie anyway... For the REALLY MESSY ones, I flipped up the lid and placed it right in the bag - which was easy to do.My son still loves to pull the handle and say ""bye-bye"" to what he considers the magic trash can.  For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags. If the odor inside gets too strong, try using Febreeze -- it even works on the plastic!Strongly MOM Approved!!",5
"Keekaroo Height Right High Chair with Tray, Natural","I was looking for a Special Tomato chair and came across this one as it is exactly the same.  My 5 year old daughter has dyspraxia and her therapist has a Special Tomato chair in her office and recommended a chair that can keep her legs from dangling.  We ordered it along with the cushions which I highly recommend since the chair and back rest is hardwood and the cushion it comes with is a very thin cover.Assembly was a little tricky but not too bad.  My biggest mistake was tightening all the screws before inserting the seat and foot rest since I was conscientious about the other reviews where the screws get loose.  I couldn't insert the seat and foot rest without loosening the screws.  I kept the screws at the foot braces tight and only loosened the top back rest screws to get the seat and foot rest in.I agree with the other reviews that the instructions should have forewarned that for older kids you can leave the top metal crossbar out of the assembly since I also had to remove that after I installed it.  When installing the braces, use wood glue into the holes for the wooden dowel pins and place them into the side of the chair instead of the cross brace.All in all, I think it is a very sturdy chair and it isn't meant to keep your child strapped in while diverting your attention to somewhere else.  I like the fact that I can use this chair when she gets much older as I already dumped her high chairs after a couple of years of use and out-growth.  Also, I haven't heard of any high chair that prevents pinched fingers from the trays.",4
"Carter's Monkey Bars Musical Mobile, Chocolate","We bought this mobile mainly because it's been proven that having a baby bed mobile on our crib is one of the best ideas for early educational development. We wanted a musical mobile with the restful sounds of classical music to help us soothe our baby boy, but not overstimulate him. It has been well established that classical music, played to a baby in the womb or from an early age, does lead to intellectual development ahead of children who have no such musical input. That's why this mobile, which plays Brahms' Lullaby, is simply perfect.",5
Hello Kitty 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set,I got this set for my daughter when we converted her crib to a toddler bed. She loves it! I think it's ok but I really wish it wasn't polyester:(. But I knew that when I bought it. Holds up well so far.,3
Hair Wash Lounger with Free Bath Sponges and Face Cloth,"My 4 and 2 1/2 yr olds use this for their baths. Makes &#34;scrubbing&#34; them up and washing their hair so much easier. I love this chair and would HIGHLY recommend it. It is large and take up 1/3-1/2 of a standard tub, but we hang it off the the shower nozzle when not in use and it works out just fine.",5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue","I really liked this swaddler, but it seemed way too big for my son as a newborn and that's when he really needed it most.  He weighed 6lb. 12.oz and was 20"" when he was born and couldn't fit into this until he was at least 10lbs.  I had to use receiving blankets (the carter's stretchy fleece blankets seemed to work best for me) for the first two months.  Once he was able to use it....WE BOTH LOVED IT!  He didn't need swaddling much after 3 months so we only got one good month out of it.  It's only $10 so that's not bad and it held up well in the wash (I washed it almost everyday that month too) It definately stayed on better than the blankets and the velcro holds very well.  Just a tip though...be sure to put your velcro tabs together before you wash it or you will get it stuck to everything in the wash!In a nutshell, they need more sizes to accomodate newborns under 10lbs., 10-20lbs. and even one bigger as another reviewer recommended for 4-7 month old babies who still need swaddling.",3
"Trend Lab Caterpillar Blooming Bouquet Burp Cloths, Set of 4","We registered for these and I thought they'd be a cute alternative to using a cloth diaper as a burp cloth. We used them once or twice, laundered them, and now they sit in the drawer.  They're wash cloths with a pretty piece of cloth stitched to one side.  Not quite big enough if your baby is even half as wiggly as our little guy.  They're not even that absorbent and the wash cloth is quite rough. The pretty material shrank up a bit, too, so now the cloth puckers on the sides because one side is smaller than the other.If you're looking for burp cloths, your best bet by far is a cloth diaper- they're soft, absorbent, launder really well, and can take lots of abuse and still last forever.  Gerber makes a 12 pack that doesn't cost too much more than a pack of four of these non-functional burp cloths.",1

"NUK Gerber Graduates Pack of 4 Advance Insulated Cup, Girl, 9 Ounce",I use to swear by the nuk cups and was so happy when they finally made an insulated version. The quality has gone down hill to the point where the cup is now cheap and not worth the money. I have had these and the boys sports version and both are a piece of junk. The paint rubs off and more importantly the inside of the lid where the valve goes has cracked on every single cup causing leaks. Take my advice...the best cup on the market is the Playtex Coolster Tumbler for kids 15mos +. They don't leak and they don't show chew marks.,2
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"It worked fine in the beginning. The picture is fuzzy can't see any detail. Now, the portable receiver has stopped receiving any signal from the camera. Worse when it looses signal it beaps really loud, a volume level not controllable and wakes up the baby. Very Dissapopinted!",1
"Davinci MDB Bookcase, Espresso","The overall construction of this shelving unit is very solid and sturdy.  Unfortunately, the item I received has a very large and noticable crack -- about 13"" -- on the outside side of the right side panel.  The shipping weight was just shy of 110lb, meaning re-boxing and returning is simply not going to be worth the effort.  Overall it is a nice bookcase, it is just a shame it was damaged when received.",3
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,"With any extra weight, this was difficult to keep stuck to the wall. We used all kinds of tricks: cleaning off the tile with soap and water, getting the tile a little damp first, cleaning the tile with alcohol first, using 3M wall adhesive. The bag would always stay up for a few days and then come crashing down. I'll have to look for an alternative product. :(",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","It's kind of weird to be putting a cover over your crib sheet (and never having to change the crib sheet), but these were a lifesaver after my daughter started leaking poop like crazy overnight.  Changing the crib sheet daily was NOT fun.After I got this, it got a bit easier.  It's not super fast to unsnap and snap on, but better than replacing the crib sheet (esp given I have a mobile that gets in the way of taking the mattress out).I have 3 of these so I don't have to immediately wash the dirty one.Only con is that the material seems a little rough.  Not as soft as the crib sheet fabric, unfortunately.",4
"The Safe Sippy Cup, Blue","We purchased more of these after we use one for a few months.  We now have a few whose color correspond to what's inside.  There's travel plugs, different valve controls, a straw, and the sippy can turn into a cup later on.  Replacement parts are available for every valve, straw, seals, ect... when you lose one in the sink or dishwasher.  These are fantastic.  There no BPA, there are no other hormone mimics, this is the best.  I wish there was one my size.",5
Potty Time Potty Watch - Blue,"This really helped potty train my daughter....but it broke after 2 days :( The screen protector fell off. Great idea, but too bad it only lasted a couple days.",3
"Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 2.8 Inch","I bought this monitor about 8 months ago at a different retailer. It has been perfect for my family for about 7 months.Pros:1.) The picture is pretty good. This is my first video monitor but I can see my son clearly.2.) The talk feature is great. Whenever our son gets fussy we're able to ""shush"" him and most of the time he quiets down right away from that reassurance without us having to go into the room. If I even come close to the room it's all done and I'm sucked in for awhile so this is definitely a great feature!3.) You can turn off the video but keep the sound on.Cons:1.) Although the temperature gauge worked for quite awhile, it is no longer accurate.2.) As other reviewers have said, our sound has completely stopped. We're currently using our other (non-video) monitor and just watching on this monitor until we can find another monitor we like. We are within the warranty put are not going to get another parent unit. We were lucky enough to buy this from a great retailer that will be giving us a full refund.In the long run, I think the monitor is a great monitor that does have a flaw. I've noticed that other companies aren't carrying this particular unit any longer so I'm hoping motorola has figured out their flaws and fixed the sound issue. Would I buy a motorola monitor again? I think so, but with caution. Depending on which company I buy it from I will be checking on the warranty information and will be paying for the extended warranty. Because, in the long run, if you're willing to spend over $150 on a product what is $30 or so more to get an extended warranty?",3
"SwaddleDesigns Cotton Flannel Fitted Crib Sheet, Mod Circles, Pastel Blue","I bought this item from Swaddledesigns directly.  While the crib sheet is very soft and looks amazing, it is too small for my crib mattress.  I double checked both the size of the sheet and size of my crib mattress before purchasing, but this crib sheet still ended up not being able to reach all four corners of the mattress (and this is right out of the package.)  I was hoping for a tight fit to make sure that the sheet didn't roll up the mattress, but this is not a tight fit...it's just plain too small.",2

It wasn't in any medela packaging, so sometimes that is weird, but all the medela products I have ordered through ANB baby haven't been but have functioned exactly as they were supposed it.

"Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue","I used this for the first 2 months to help me remember when I fed my daughter last.  Even though she ate every 3 hours, so many times I couldn't remember what time it was when she last had a bottle.  I didn't really use it for any of the other features because I changed her diaper at every feeding unless she pooped.",5
Safety 1st Baby's 1st 3-in-1 Thermometer,I bought this thermometer to have on hand for our newborn because I thought this was as quick as they come.  I wish I would have found the much quicker (less than 10 seconds) thermometers first and not wasted time and money on this one.  It takes too long for us and doesn't seem to be accurate (seems like it reads cooler than the actual temp).,2
bumGenius One-Size Hook &amp; Loop Closure Cloth Diaper 4.0 - Blossom,"Love this diaper except for one thing:When my daughter was about 1 she learned how to remove the Velcro straps, otherwise this is another solid cloth diaper investment.Bottom line:You'll get about a good years worth of use with this model diaper, afterwards you should switch to buttons unless you want a poopy mess.",5
"Playtex Lil' Gripper/TrainingTime Straw Trainer Cup, 6 Ounce , Colors May Vary","I gave my 11 month old this cup and she immediately started to drink, though she has never used a straw. The handles are great for baby's hands, and I have never had problem with spilling for 3 months!",5
Horseland Interactive Chili &amp; Chloe,"My daughter got this for Christmas and while she is only 3 1/2, she enjoys playing with it.  Chili talks on his own when you push his head down.  Chloe begins talking with she is placed on Chili's back.  The first thing Chloe says is that ""she's the smart one"".  She then goes on to say ""what could possibly be better than fashion"" and ""is my lip gloss cool or what?"" which is irritating and makes me wonder what the other sets talk about if she is ""the smart one"".  Both Chili and Chloe refer to the other horse and rider sets as well.  It comes with accessories for Chloe to use and for your child to use to brush Chili.The concept is cute and it's fun to play with, but Chloe could definitely use some more IQ points.  I doubt we'll be buying any of the other sets.",3
"Dreambaby Stroller Fan, White/Blue","Like many reviewers before me have said, this thing eats batteries (2 AA). Couple hours at most (I've never timed it). But for my infant son who gets sweaty-backed in his car seat (and most other times too) this is great! Just clip to the car seat handle bar (or stroller, high chair, etc...) and aim at his head (the body's radiator) and it really makes a difference. Foam blades are good for his little fingers too, although they will stay bent for a while if you leave the fan off laying against the blades. No ripping yet after a couple months. Neck is bendable and will just reach over the front of the clip without the fan blades touching.TIP: keep a dozen AA batteries in the car.",4
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Lap Pads, Ecru, 3 Pack","Does the job perfectly, highly recommended for all the cloth diaperers - esp if using the traditional muslin nappies! Absorbs really well",5

Disana Organic Merino Wool Cover-Natural-86/92 (12-24 mo),"I am a busy working mom trying to cloth diaper.  Have a little 7 month old boy that nurses all night and of course makes an equal amount of huge pee diapers.  We were having trouble with him soaking through everything.  Had tried a million combinations of BG free times, Flip system, BG pocket stuffed, Fuzzi bunz stuffed, Thirsties, prefolds, covered with Flip stay dri, fleece outers, etc...Now we have added what we affectionately named ""Woolie"" (the Disana merino) cover to the mix.  I was scared of the extra work of wool but people are right it is actually easier b/c you only have to wash it a couple times of month if you spot clean it.  (*once you get it properly lanolized).  We are using lanolin mixed with Eucalan to get it up to snuff.  Also we were afraid it would be itchy.  This wool is so soft and after you lanolize it, even softer.  I honestly had never had anything made of virgin wool before.  Amazing.  Really happy.  Saving our pennies to get a second one.  Super happy I got a slightly larger size b/c they fit like capris right now but will last him a long time.***updateWe are still using this single wool cover and it is the best diaper cover for overnight for a heavy wetter.  Hands down.  Nothing can beat wool.  We use a Bamboozle with a Flip Stay Dri under it and have had great success.  I have even added a wool bed liner to the mix.  Pee has never ever soaked through it to the mattress.  Wool is awesome.  Still using the Eucalan with Now Lanolin about once every 3 weeks.",5
"Graco Blossom 4-In-1 Seating System, Sapphire","I left the following review (with 2 stars) before realizing that you CAN remove the straps to wash them.  I couldn't figure it out but my husband did.  So I apologize about my inaccurate review and I've added 2 stars.  I'm leaving the original so I don't confuse people who may have already read it.With the whole strap dilemma I ended up taking the seat off of the high chair and trying it out at our dining room table.  This I think is the best feature of this chair.  It turns into a booster so you really get a lot of use out of it.Good high chair, I'd definitely recommend it for the price.Former Review:We loved this chair at first.  I agree with the other reviewers: reclining options are good, the 4 in 1 system grows with your child, chair moves around easily on wheels, all around a good value.  Except for one thing.  The straps and seat cushion aren't removable.  I didn't anticipate this being a problem.  I just thought I would clean it as I go and no big deal.Well my son is 20 months old now and I just want to run the straps and cushion through the washer!  Or clean them and lay out in the sun!  But I can't.  They are connected to the chair and even if I found a way to rip them off there would be no getting them back on.  I clean the chair after every meal (but my husband isn't as great about that), and we give him fruit smoothies made with yogurt and whole milk as a snack pretty often.  That means the straps have a rotten milk smell no matter how well I clean them!  If anyone has any tips for this I'd love them.  I hate to waste this whole chair :(  I can get them clean and smelling less, but I want the smell gone completely!  It's disgusting.So, all in all a good chair at first.  After months of meals though, it would be so much better if the straps and cushion were removable for cleaning.  I would recommend buying another chair that has a removable seat cushion and strap feature.",4

"Chinese Prefold Diaper: White, Small (up to 15 lbs)","I ordered these diapers as burp rags and they really shrank.  Although the website clearly states that they will shrink, I was just a little surprised at how much they shrank.The up side is that they are soft and absorbant for the use as a burp rag; albeit a little small for my taste.Spend the cash and by the largest size possible.",4
"Gerber First Essential Clear View BPA Free Plastic Nurser With Latex Nipple, Assorted Colors, 9 Ounce, 3 Pack","I wanted to write a review for all those new mommies like me about bottles and my experiences with each of the ones I tried.  First, my hubby thinks I am a hoarder of bottles.  If there were a competition to put together baby bottles and all their different parts I think I would win. I have tried Gerber, Platex, Avent and Dr. Browns.Gerber: These were the cheapest of all that I tried.  You can find them on Amazon (9 bottles just costing under $10).  The ring and nipples go great with the ready to use formula that they give babies at the hospital.They function well but I did notice that these bottles cause air bubbles in the formula when my daughter uses them. Perfect nipple speed though and I liked the bottles because there is little amounts of formula dribbling out the side of my daughter's mouth and not a whole lot like other bottles.  This means she was not soaked at the end of her feeding and less chances of a rash to occur on her chin/neck.I really like how the 9 oz. bottles come with medium nipples, so if you use this you don't have to rebuy new nipples.  Some 8-9oz bottles come with slow nipples.  I like how they give you extra room to mix formula.  I will try this bottle again in the near future after my little one has less of a gas issue (6 month +).  Dr. Brown's travel caps also works great with these bottles and cheap to buy.Platex: I tried Vent Air and regular drop-ins.  With the Vent air there is significantly less bubbles in the formula. However, the nipples are super slow though for slow flow. It would take my daughter twice as long to finish a bottle.I hear though that if you are breastfeeding this slow flow is better so that the babies don't prefer the faster flow of a bottle vs. breast.  Cons: the 6 oz bottles are perfect for 4 oz. feeding. The bottles are curved and hard to mix formula because it spills out. Also there is no need for a liner that saves on cost.Platex also has regular drop-in liners that are great- no bubbles in formula but I think that is rather expensive for liners ($7/ 100 liners).  Even with a generic brand liner you shell out $5 per 100 liners and that's about $10-15 a month.I also hate that 8 oz. bottles come with a slow nipple.  Not sure if they just want you to spend extra on nipples.  They sell 2 nipples for $4 pack- so if you have 8 bottles that is about $16. So this bottle adds up. It's less washing though so that's convenient.I also think it's hard to measure the water with liners. I usually have to take another bottle and measure out the water in that and pour it into the liner.Avent: I got samples of the wide neck 4 oz.  I hate and love these bottles. Hindsight, I think my daughter got a lot of gas while using them.  We started her on these bottles (birth-3 months).  I did read that another mom used Avent after the baby finished their gassy period (4+months) so I will be going back to try these bottles again when she is older.I bought the 8 oz. wide glass bottles and they are beautiful.  Cons are, however, that so much formula dribbles out the side of my daughter's mouth and they are really heavy.The nipples are faster than most bottles and you have to figure out when to change them.  You simply can't go by the months listed on the box.  May be this wouldn't be an issue for babies who are bigger and faster eaters.  My friends who have boys tend to do really well with these bottles.Huge advantage of the 4 oz. wide neck bottles are that you can get sealing discs for cheap and they convert into the cutest baby food/ snack container. At least you can feel good about getting all your monies worth from these bottles since you can use them for a different purpose.Reviews I read also said that GERBER gentle flow is the same as Avent standard bottles.  If you knew this you can buy the Gerber gentle flow nipples that are way cheaper and fit the Avent standard bottles well. I tried to look for the gentle flow bottles but they are nowhere to be found on my end.",4

It is the only child-view mirror I can find with my sedan, which lacks head rests upon which most of these mirrors rely.  When I have my second child I plan to get two more of these mirrors - one above my infant, and one to angle respectively on the windshield so I can see the mirror above my infant.I have to say, my mirror has not fallen yet after having it up for over a year.  Perhaps it is different on the rear wondow, but on the windhsield it works perfectly.  Great peace of mind for &lt;$10.",5

Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,"I have BRITAX Roundabout to go with this tray.  Fit very nice and tight because the strap can be adjusted.my daughter already plays in it with paper and pen =D  looking forward to bring this in airplane with her carseat!i'll update the review after the trip**UPDATE**We use this to travel internationally.  It fits great since we got the bulkseat on the plane.  So she has her own tray she can use for playing and drawing.The only thing is that, the foam was not sturdy enough since it is made lightweighted (so that it can fold well).  The handcurve on the britax roundabout made the end of the tray a little slump down. So this is not an even tray.I did not use it for her food tray just because I worried it will tip off and made a huge mess in the flight.  and worried also that it will be hard to clean on the corner side of the tray and the side tray wall.The material is mostly like a disposable tablecloth for the party (of course with more weight and better quality than that). So you can wipe it.For the car use, it hold up verywell to keep my daughter entertained with whatever toys put in front of her.",5

Works perfectly in this capacity, very versatile: narrow enough for standard doors and can go wide enough for hallways, most places you'd think of using it. Four rubber ""feet"" on each side provide a decent amount of protection for surfaces, and compress enough to make for a very snug fit; the gate doesn't need to be touch the ground and will stay place very securely.",5
"Tiny Love Tiny Smart Rattle, Harry Hippo",Very cute and entertaining toy for carseat. Baby wont be bored! Love it! Good price too love it awesome yes,5
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet",We bought this when my daughter was 2 months old.  We contemplated a cheaper mobile but are glad we spent the extra $.  She loved it!!  She is more attracted to the lion.  She'll follow it the whole way around.  We have found that the heartbeat seems to calm her down the best and help her fall to sleep easier.  The projection doesn't seem to show up very well on the ceiling but makes a good night light to be able to peek in and see your little one until it shuts itself off.  And the way it shuts it self down is great too!  It shuts down in stages instead of all at once!  We've been using it every night for a month now and the batteries still seem to be doing great.  The different options of using the light/music/mobile or music/mobile or just mobile is nice too.  We would definately recommend this to anyone!!  Definately worth the money :),4
Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System Key,We had purchased a Multi pack and split the locks up amongst different rooms. This is nice to have a extra key available for the other rooms.,5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","We love this gate, easy to open and close, sturdy, and best of all it was $50 less than a similar one at target.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a great transitional toy. We've had it since my son was tiny - as an infant, he liked to look at the lights and colors. At 18 months, he dances to the music and loves pressing the buttons. I don't think he fully gets the concept of adding and removing instruments to the orchestra yet, so once he figures that out, we'll have many more months of fun with the music cube. The music is pleasant - my only complaint is that it only has one volume setting.One word of caution, if you have a climber - this toy makes a great stepping stool for toddlers who like to climb out of their cribs. :)We love the music cube - highly recommend it!",5
Infantino Stay Cool Cooler Bag,You can place your lunch in the back and your baby's food in the front.  It is especially handy if one will be away for the entire day and you have to pack more than one meal.,4
Baby's First Love Bug Doll,This adorable First Love Bug Doll is just the right size for little hands.  It is soft and cuddly and will be loved and slept with by any little girl every night.,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",Looks great in the package and hoping my daughter will love it! My son loved these nipples so we are hoping our daughter is the same.,5
"Bamboobies 2 Pair Ultra-Thin Regular Nursing Pads, Pale Pink","I wanted thin, discreet nursing pads that didn't itch and didn't look bunchy under clothing, and these are the best I've found. The material is soft and the heart shape helps keep them from wrinkling and being visible under clothes. They're not completely wrinkle-free, but they're much better than any other kind I've tried and they usually don't show under a t-shirt. And they don't itch at all like disposable pads do. They have held up well in the wash so far (cold water, delicate cycle, low heat in the dryer) but I've only washed them a handful of times. I bought two pairs to try them out and I like them enough that I'll probably get a few more.",4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",My son comes to work with me and I keep him in here when he's active - sleepy. I've had it now for almost a year. What a great buy.,4
"Scene Weaver Mossy Oak Camouflage Baby Blanket, Break-Up Infinity",This is a beautiful blanket my baby girl loves it. We have had it for almost a year now and it has held up wonderfully.,5
"Maxi Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat, Sweet Cerise","Bought this car seat for my 2.5 year old to give her more leg room to rear face longer. (NHSTA recommends until your child turns 4: [...]). She was complaining in her previous car seat about being ""stuck"". The Pria gives her plenty of leg room (she mostly sits ""criss cross.."") and she loves how it feels. It also gives her more of a view out of the car. It was relatively easy to install. The only issue we had was moving the LATCH strap from forward facing position to rear facing position. You have to undo the car seat cover and move the strap down (not in the manual). Once we figured it out, the install went well. The fabric feels like neoprene and there is plenty of cushion. She fell asleep in the car seat the first week, which she had not done in months. This is a good option for anyone looking to ERF.",5
"Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry Diaper Bag, Black",This wet bag hold 2-3 days f dirty cloth diapers for use. I put the used shells in the dry part because I wash them separately from the inserts. I've never had a leaking problem.,5
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,"This is now an indispensible part of my diaper bag, and I rarely leave home without it.  Very easy to nurse discreetly in public, and the wire in front lets you see the baby and make adjustments.  Fabric is high quality, rolls up to small size, and the little towel-part at the bottom is useful for wiping spit-up.",5
The Floppy Seat: Deluxe Shopping Cart Seat Cover with EZ Carry Storage Bag!,"I personally was not happy with the Floppy Seat. I do not like the way it moved around in the cart & it was not convenient to store. I then purchased the Buggy Bagg & was extremely happy with that product. The padding, convenience & features of the Buggy Bagg were far more superior than the Floppy Seat. I would like to see Toys R Us carry the Buggy Bagg. It is the absolute best.",1
The First Years All Terrain Stroller 9 Piece Set,"I LOVE IT!!!!! It's so perfect and unique and looks like it cost a fortune! This was a great buy! I found it and my mother-in-law bought it for us as a baby shower gift & it's even better in person! Overall great product, strolls around great & is simple to take apart and fold up! I'm very happy with this stroller!",5
"Baby Jogger City Select Silver Frame Stroller, Onyx","There's one thing this stroller isn't good for, and that, oddly enough, is jogging.  It's not designed for it (for that you need the Summit X3 model), so the brand name is confusing.  That aside, it does just about anything else you'd want a stroller to do, and it does it well.It has to be assembled, but that's relatively easy.  The straps are a little tricky to install correctly and require some patience, but the wheels, the seat, the sun shade all just snap in place.The design is extremely versatile.  The seat reclines at different angles.  The canopy adjusts to different angles.  The seat can be placed to allow you to look at your child, or to allow the child to face where you're going.  The handlebar and foot well are adjustable.  If you want to purchase additional items you can add another whole seat (which can be mounted facing either direction),a bassinet, cup holders, bags, canopies, and so on.  Yes, the cost of the base stroller is high, and adding options makes it even higher, but this stroller will last a long time--it's designed to hold kids up to 45 pounds (per seat), which should take you through the first four years and can be passed on or sold.The fabric is durable and wipes clean easily.The stroller maneuvers smoothly in all directions, without any rickety jiggling.  If you're petite you may find folding it a little more difficult than others might, since you have to reach mechanisms on both sides of the stroller at the same time as you pull, but it's very doable, and it folds up flat if you remove the seat.",5
Summer Infant Sure Sight Digital Color Video Monitor,"Great monitor so far. Baby is not here yet, but we've been using it to watch the dog. It works great and the video is clear. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because we had to get a little creative on where to hang to see the crib. Ended up screwing base into a shelf on the wall. Not ideal for everyone.",4
Comfort U Total Body Support Pillow (Full Size),I highly recommend this pillow!  I kept going back and forth about breaking down and spending the money for a pillow.  It was completely worth it and i would highly recommend for those who are pregnant and having trouble sleeping at night.  So  comfy and worth every penny!,5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"This swing is an absolute lifesaver and it was worth every penny I spent on it. From the moment we brought our son home from the hospital he has enjoyed this swing. We keep it in the side to side motion mode (though you can choose front to back as well) and he will literally stay happy and occupied for hours--this includes the time he spends sleeping in the swing. When he turned about 6 weeks old, he really started to enjoy the lights, sounds and circling fish. Now at 8 weeks, he talks ""at"" the fish all the time! It is fun to watch, and on a more economic point, for as much as we use the swing, it does not seem to drain the batteries as much as we thought it might.Honestly, as a brand new mother, if there is one baby product that I could not live without, it would be this swing.Be forewarned, it does take up a lot of space, but if you can make the room, it is worth the sacrifice.",5
"Itti Bitti Bitti Tutto One-size Cloth Diaper, Chocolate","To be fair, I don't want to knock these just yet. I understand that with the more use, the more absorbent they become. And since this is the first cloth diaper I decided to try, I don't have others to compare it to. After watching a YouTube tutorial, this diaper was very easy to use. I love that it has many absorbent layers if you choose to use them all. However, my experience with all 3 layers overnight ended up with wet jammies and mattress...if he peed a lot they just didn't hold up. Likewise, his poo (he is breastfed so he has that soft watery yellow poo) would always run off and get into the minkie shell, requiring the shell to be washed along with the inserts...every time. I ended up buying more of these with the intention of diapering him during weekends when I'm home from work, so maybe with more daytime trials (rather than night soaks) they'll live up to their reputation. One thing I found annoying is how hard it is to buy extra inserts sans shell...most websites were sold out so I had to buy the whole shebang (minkie she'll and all)  just to get the extra inserts. I'm not sure why there seems to be a supply issue, but keep that in mind before buying this.",3
SASSY Stacking CUPS BABY TOY LEARNING interactive NEW,"My kids loved these as babies, and still love them as kindergarteners.  From bath toys to pool toys to sand toys, they are the best.",5
Cybex u.Go Baby Wrap - Eclipse - One Size,"I am using this wrap with my first son, who has severe colic with near constant crying/screaming. I've tried so many things to treat his colic, from bottles, speciality formulas, white noise, holds, etc. but he won't stop crying and won't nap during the day, so he gets quite distressed. However, when I place him in this wrap he immediately quiets down and often goes right to sleep. The wrap is high quality and versatile, allowing a variety of different holds. An illustrated instruction manual is included, but I found their videos on Youtube easier to follow. It is not easy to use and takes practice, but it makes my baby happy and it is easier to carry him than in a car seat, so I highly recommend this product.",5
"Thermos FOOGO Stainless Steel Food Jar, Blue, 7 Ounce","We have two very active kids in our household (5- and 2-year olds). They are frequently on the go, and my wife frequently prepares an assortment of snack and meals in the morning.This 7 oz jar is notable for two things: (1) it looks much smaller than 10 oz and (2) compatible with Foogo bottle (not tall enough to accommodate the straw, however). Although only 30% less in volume, 7 oz feels so much smaller and occupies much less space in lunch bag.Just like its larger 10 oz sibling, this 7 oz jar is very high quality and easy to wash. I recommend hand washing as hot dishwasher may loosen the glue holding the bottom base.Once sealed, food stays cool or warm for about 6 hours. We normally pack them in insulated bag, which extends freshness for 4 additional hours.Since receiving the review unit, we ordered 3 additional jars. Each kid now has two 7oz jars (1 for meal, 1 for desserts) and a Foogo bottle for milk. Meanwhile, my wife uses Foogo's 10 oz jar and Nissan bottle.",4
"RECARO ProSPORT Combination Harness To Booster Car Seat, Blue Opal",I purchased this seat since my 2 1/2 yr old was getting too big for the bucket carseat (33 lbs).We had a bit of trouble installing it in tight enough. It's still a bit loose when you move the seat side to side.Other then that its great!!! Would recommend for sure!,4
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Walk-Thru, Neutral finish",I know that many people would subtract a star for the fact that it does not automatically close.  After extensive research we could not find a gate this size that did so it doesn't feel right to knock a star off for something that other similar products don't do. It is actually nice to be able to leave the gate open during bedtime and nap time.Our Son is a 1 year old tank - 32lbs+ and 33+ inches and the gate hardly moves when he pulls himself up on it or attacks it.Installation was relatively simple (we went into wood door jams over a 6ft span).  Required a little work to line everything up and the gate can be somewhat unwieldy so a helper is a good idea.The screws do extend on either side to help make the gate easily adjustable to fit perfectly.  I know some people complained about this but it isn't really an issue (aesthetically or safety-wise) and makes installation easier. Our 1 year old has found spinning the little nut that holds the screw from loosening to be a lot of fun.  Doesn't seem to affect the overall stability of the gate so no biggie.We were hoping/led to believe this gate is white.  It is actually closer to a bisque.  This annoys my wife but I can't see how being off white hinders the gate's ability to function properly so I'm not subtracting stars for that either - just note that it is not stark white.There are not a lot of these sized gates out there and this one is great.,5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"We chose to get this for our daughter instead of an exasaucer because this allowed her the freedom to move around the room.We bought it as a Christmas gift but a month before, we couldn't wait to try it out any longer!  So she started using it at three months.  Her feet didn't touch the floor but she could hold her head sturdy, so we just propped a rolled up blanket in the front for her.  She used it up untul about 8 months when she started to crawl and toddle around.It's a great unit!  Well worth the money and easy to clean too.",5
"Baby Aspen Big Dreamzzz Baby Ballerina Layette Set with Gift Box, Pink","The item says it is a layette set, which would be for a newborn.  However, what we received would be too big for most 12 month olds, if not older.  Very, very large.",1
Evenflo Splash Mega Exersaucer,"My seven month old granddaughter loves it, however I have to put extra things up there for her to play with; because the toys are not very entertaining. The toys come off too easy and are not that durable. If you need something in the lower price range than yes, i would recommend this to you.",3
"Bright Starts Around We Go Activity Station, Doodle Bugs","We purchased this product for my 7 month old to use. It was the only walker type of toy available at our local store and it was $90. I figured, hey if it is expensive it is probably worth it! Nope! We got it home and put it all together and the thing wont go around the base! I figured, hey, maybe I put it together wrong, so we took it apart and did it again. Same result. It seems that the part that locks on wont go past the seams on the post. It is terrible. I am taking apart what I can and taking it back. I am not going to have a $90 toy that is useless sitting around the house.",1
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,My 2 month old already has a lot of fun with this toy. Each section has different feels and makes different sounds. This toy can also be used to measure a baby's height.,5
Annabel Karmel by NUK Food Masher &amp; Bowl,well made product that is very useful for mashing up fruits that a fork cannot get completely.  I mash up raw and cooked fruits and veggies on the go with this,5
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet, Celery","I got this sheet for use on my baby's Dream on Me mini crib. It fits the mattress that came with the crib perfectly. The color is nice and rich, very cute. This sheet is very soft.",5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","These breast pads are very soft.  I don't even notice them when I am wearing them.  They are much more comfortable than scratchy disposable pads.  They are very absorbent, but I do change them several times a day.  Overall, they meet my expectations, and I am ordering more.",5
"Gift Mark Bench, Natural","I recently purchased this item and was quite pleased with what I received, The product was delivered on time and turned out to be a very sturdy bench for my photo sessions. Very pleased with Amazon so far.",5
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","I got this gate originally planning to use it for my 8-month old. Needless to say, when I got it - I felt it was more suited for a pet, as opposed to a baby. The gate is fairly secure when it is used as an independent unit, but is not so great if you are trying to ""box in"" something and use a wall as the remainder of the unit. I found it to be pretty wobbly for a baby who may try to pull up on the gate. However, I think this would work for a pet. I only mention this because some of the pictures showed this being used for children, but I found it to be less than ideal.",3
Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Bottle Starter Kit,"I only use these bottles, my daughter would not take any other ones right from the start. I can not compare to other brands but I can tell you that she doesn't spit up, which may be her naturally, but I wouldn't switch from these bottles just in case. They are more work to clean ,but if you buy enough they can be put in the dishwasher so it really isn't a big deal.  I also read other reviews about leaking and can honestly say I have never had a single leak.  There is a line on the bottle that says not to fill above and also for travel they provide a ""travel disc"" to fit under the nipple to prevent leaks so I am not sure how other people have all these problems.  I really think these are a great product and certainly worth trying!",4
Thirsties Duo All in One Snap Cloth Diaper Size 1- 6 Pack Gender Neutral Colors with Dainty Baby Reusable Bag Bundle,"Overall, the Thirsties Duo All In One is my favourite cloth diaper. For the record, we have tried Thirsties AIO, GroViA AIO Newborn, and Real Nappies prefolds and covers.GroVia leaks-no matter what we do. I can't recommend them to anyone.Real Nappies are great.They're super absorbent, easy to wash and dry, and are very affordable. I'd rate them five stars as well. Only problem is bulk and I suspect a toddler might be able to remove them easily because they're velcro and not snap closure. My husband loves these ones.We tried Thirsties because I suspect daycare won't do a prefold/cover diaper. Thirsties fit our baby girl well, I like the colors and patterns, and they're easy to use.There are three cons. One, when we first tried them, they leaked. So we added some absorbency, and now they're great. Second con is drying time, which is longer than pre-folds. However, I've found that if I turn them inside out before putting them in the dryer it helps them dry faster. The final con is price-they are expensive-much more so than the Real Nappies system. However, the pros outweigh that, and I'm buying more when she is ready for size 2.",5
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","We ordered this seat for the click tight installation.  My son is only 2 but is as tall and heavy as a 3 year old.  We had a GRACO, but it seemed like an upgrade was needed.  We took a car trip this weekend and our son fell asleep in the seat.  Usually his head would slump forward, but it did not in this new seat!  The harness adjustment button was a little difficult to find, but adjusting the strap height was a breeze.  All we had to do was squeeze the release at the top of the seat and pull up.  Gone are the days of re-threading straps.  I wish that we could up grade our other car seat to a Britax Frontier 90!",5
"Prince Lionheart Faucet Extender, Gumball Green",Works great at getting the water within reach for my little one.  We had to do some adjusting so the water wouldn't just sit in the extender once the water was turned off.  But that was very easy to do since the colored portion is a soft silicone and very pliable.,5
"Kids Line Musical Mobile, Sweet Dreams","Mobile works just like you'd expect it to.  Place nice little song.  Only reason I gave it a 4-star was because our bed is angled on the side, so we couldn't put it exactly where we wanted it to go.  Otherwise, if the sides of our bed was flat, it would have gotten 5-star.",4
"Mary Meyer Blanket and Toy, Cutsie Caterpillar","I bought this for my granddaughter who ABSOLUTELY LOVES it.  Even though she is merely 5 months old, when she sees her &#34;wubbie, she's ready for bed.  LOVE IT!!!!!",5
Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,"We visit my inlays at least once a month, sometimes for a week at a time, and while we're there my son sleeps in his Graco Pack n' Play. I keep noticing that after one night my son will get fussy, has a hard time falling asleep and wakes up throughout the night (which is not like him). I was hoping that a better mattress would help him sleep better and I would say that it worked. This mattress is so much better than the little cardboard surface. Highly Recommended.",5
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"For this price, I can't complain too much about the minor tearing my 17-month-old caused on the strap that was easy to repair. It's easy to install, easy to clean, and easy to get my kid in and out of. I don't know that there is a line of these that looks somehow more fashionable, but it certainly doesn't look tacky or cheap on my counter. I'm going to get another to use with my baby when he's ready for a seat.",4
"Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory","I've used this for about 3 weeks now and love this thing.  I'm almost 5 months along and don't think I could sleep without it now.  Love you don't have to re-position throughout the night, can get out / in easily.  I have a king bed and plenty of room still even with this.  Great to read in bed and watch tv comfortably as well.  Get it!",5
"Bright Starts Start Your Senses Shake, Rattle and Swim",This is one of his favorite toys! He takes it everywhere and it's a safe way to keep him busy,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I should have read the reviews on this bottle before I registered for them.  I too planned on breastfeeding and was told this was the best for switching back and forth between breast and bottle.  I also had to stop breatfeeding and go to the bottle 100%.  I've tried every angle and no matter what these bottles leak like mad.  Most of the formula ends up down the side of my daughters face or in her bib.  Additionally my daughter takes in to much air and has constant issues with gas. I am now looking for a different bottle.  Do your research because it can save you a lot of frustration and money.,2
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia",Great chair.  It is cute and functional.  We are glad we bought it and the price is good.  Thank you.,5

Adelina Madelina It's A Breeze Diaper Backpack - Storm/Lime,"Overall I really like this bag. It has enough pockets and room for all baby's stuff (2 months.)  My two big complaints are the closures: The zipper gets stuck almost every time, and the magnetic closure on the front isn't very strong or easy to find with one hand.",3
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","My new born is very happy with this swing, sleeps for hours the time on the music and toys movement works only for 15 mis aprox, but the swing keeps going I really like it",5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Green Cocoa Dot","This is perfect in the larger size for overtired and cranky babies.  I don't need it all of the time, but it really helps when my baby is overtired.",5
"Prince Lionheart Flexibath Foldable Bathtub, White","This is one of the best purchases we have made.  It saves water, it saves space.  It has anti-slip rubber on the bottom.  Our daughter is now 2 years old, 30lbs and 35 inches tall and still fits in this very well.Small negatives is the latch doesn't always hold it closed.  We hardly close it.  When we take it somewhere we usually put items in it.You have to fill it with some water before your child decides to sit in it against the sides or it tips very easily while empty.  You have to hold it down when you are emptying it as well.Still looks as new as the day we bought it.Kevin Emlinger",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"If you buy this gate, do not buy it online unless you can return it to a store (which you can do with Babies r Us). I have three of these gates, and the first one I tried to install was terrible. The gate has two slatted panels and in order to close the gate, you have to slide one panel and latch it. But the panels would not slide - they were so stiff I would have had to use my foot as well as my hand to close the gate! Obviously unacceptable. But I checked another of the gates and it was fine, and worked like a charm. I don't know if it's relevant or not, but the first gate was made in Mexico, and the second in China. Maybe there's a bad batch of Mexican-made gates out there, or maybe it was just a one-off. I don't know, but it may be something for you to be aware of if you purchase this gate.Also, I attached the gate to a relatively narrow doorway, so the two panels were mostly overlapping. So the gate is nice and sturdy, and I think it would be good even at the top of stairs, if the stairway is narrow. However, I DO NOT recommend this gate for use anywhere - especially the top of stairs - if you need to use it towards its widest range. The two panels are then stretched out and the gate becomes flimsy. It's my suspicion that those who have complained about the gate being flimsy and the bottom rail popping out have used the gate in a wider opening than those who think its a sturdy gate. So don't buy this gate if you need it for a wide opening.Finally, the third gate also slides well (made in China) but it will not fit where I wanted to put it. I suspect it is common to many gates that they work only in quite specific situations, and you can't really tell if it's going to work in your situation until you get it home and really take a good look at it. So, once again, do be sure you can return this (and probably any other) gate before buying.All in all, I recommend this gate - but ONLY IF you will be using it in a narrow opening. It is sturdy and not too difficult to install. It also looks reasonably nice if that matters to you.",3
"Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump Reducing Flanges BPA Free, 22.5 Mm - 2 Pack","I ordered these because Ameda's 25 mm flanges were too large for me. Unfortunately, this size was also too large. Plus, Ameda's design means that this smaller flange must be crammed into the larger flange when pumping. This combination of two plastic pieces makes it difficult to see whether the nipple is properly centered within the flange.",2

Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,I bought this gate to take apart and use it as a way to trap my puppy in the kitchen and off the furniture. It is easy to lift and move around. I also take it outside and use it for what is intended for--keeping the kids safe in the yard!! Great piece of equipement.,5
"Green Eats 4 Pack Feeding Spoons and Forks , Yellow",The spoons are a bit wide for my 10 month olds mouth and the forks are pretty useless. I use them as toys for him to play with while feeding him.,3
"Skip Hop Hug and Hide Activity Toy, Owl",My baby absolutely loves this toy. She can chew on it squeeze it and make noise with it. She likes it so much we bought the owl one as well in case one gets left at someone else's house.,5

Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I use it more for baby to lay on, she loves it - I'm so happy I got this and use it constantly . I'm bottle feeding so I'm not sure how good it is for nursing, but it's great for baby to lay on and look around, she does tummy time on ot too, and the seatbelt strap is great, keeps her from slipping - she's a squirm worm and only 6 weeks. She's laying on it right now as I type! :)",5
Blue Jean Teddy Mobile,My sons love this! It was one of the first toys they smiled at! Especially the panda which they follow around and smile when it comes back to them. The music plays for quite a while too. I also like the button on top that allows you to stop the music if you want.,5
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Sleigh Bed Sheet, White","This co-sleeper reeked of varnish.  We had to return it because it smelled so terrible.  I didn't want my baby breathing in the toxic fumes it was putting off.  It really is a very attractive, sturdy, easy to install piece but the smell was too much for us.",1
Philips AVENT 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I purchased Dr. Brown's Electric Steam Sterilizer before, but it died within six month; I got another one, it died within two weeks, so I think I'll give anther brand for a try, that's why I purchased this one. I read the reviews carefully, and it seems the odor problem mostly coming from the water and rust from the usage, but I was wrong. After I un-package this item, it has a very strong plasticy odor. I rinsed it, and steamed with no bottles to get rid of the odor several times, the bad smell still exist. It's not usable! I'm wondering if I should just rinse and dry and leave it open for a few week before using it. Very bad experience, strongly against buying it. The Dr. Brown one had some electric problems, but never has any bad odor to start with, nor any smells after a few months usage. Very disappointing.",1

Fisher-Price Sesame Street Bathtime Figure Pack,"I bought this for my 2 year old and she loves it! The boat floats well and one of the characters can stand up inside the boat while its floating in the water.  After a series of disappointing bath toys, it was nice to find one that works well.",5
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"This baby radio plays all sorts of nice music, most of which is classical. It has attractive colors and is easily portable. My little grandson holds it and dances to the music! He gets antsy when being diapered but when I give him this toy to distract him, he lays there quietly and allows me to get the job done. Love this little radio and highly recommend it!",5
"Evenflo Compact Fold High Chair, Polka Dottie Purple",I received my evenflo high chair the material is great exactly what I expected. But I didn't like that there were scratches on the legs and I had to wipe down the chair because it had scratches on it and rub marks. The high chair itself is very sturdy. I'm not sure I would purchase it again.,2
Triple 8 FLO Diaper Sprayer,"EDIT: 2/24/13 - i purchased this on November 7th and after LOVING it for only 3 1/2 months, it completely stopped working for no reason at all!! I'm extremely unhappy and will be contacting the company!!!I bought this diaper sprayer after our previous Bumgenius diaper sprayer fell apart and we needed a new one. I had been looking at this one for a while so I figured it was the perfect opportunity to try one. I loved that it had the water pressure adjustment right on the handle so no more bending over to the back of the toilet (that was a major pain when I was pregnant and diapering our older son!). Not only that but this one seems to have WAY more pressure to begin with. And the water comes out much more evenly or spread out. With the other one we had, it came out in too much of a jet stream. I've seen the other reviews about installation issues because of the instructions and I can't say anything about that for myself because my husband installed it and had no issues. I don't know if it helps that we had another diaper sprayer before this so he knew what he was doing this time around and he also has experience with installing toilets and things for his job (though I installed the old one myself and I know nothing about plumbing so I can't imagine). We LOVE this sprayer and would recommend it to anyone looking to buy one!! Definitely better than Bumgenius!!",5
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,"I am so happy i bought this play mat! We first put our daughter ella under when she was about a week old, and she loved it! She spends hours looking up at all the toys, and i am even ablt to hang our own toys with the extra links it came with. The arches are so stable, and we love the pillow for babies head. Well worth the money!",5
Cocalo Alphabet Soup Rug,A really nice rug for the price.  Cocalo products in general are great quality and last.  The entire alphabet soup collection is adorable.,5
Earlyears Roll n Swirl Ball Ramp,My one year old loves this and does it all on her own.  Awesome toy.  Even just having the little balls are worth it because they are interesting enough to hold the little one's attention.,5
"Sassy 2 Piece Wrist Rattles Set, Styles May Vary","Was greatly surprised when these arrived in the mail.  They look expensive and are very well made. Not made with cheap materials that are halfway sewn on or parts falling off so I was pleased at their appearance.  Baby loves them! We got the blue mouse and orange bear.  These are nice big wrist rattles, not small and chinchy.  my baby is 12 weeks old and they do not fit snugly around his wrist yet, so I liked that because he can still wear them now, but he will get to wear them for quite a while as well.  On other wrist rattles I have tried, the velcro strap was so small my baby would already have outgrown them by now, but not these.  They are cute and very vibrant and colorful as well, appear very high end for a great price!",5
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce","We've had and used two of these Foogos for over a year now, almost every day. I have absolutely no complaints at all... when I put it together... however my husband occasionally manages to twist the lid on so tightly it swivels the straw and causes it to leak. This seems to be more of a problem if the parts are wet when fitting the straw into the lid.In a nutshell, with a little care and attention this is utterly leak proof and it keeps my son's drink perfectly cool all day. It washes up well in the dishwasher too (switching off the heated dry cycle stops the plastic parts taking on any detergent smell/taste).Small print: We did need to do a small amount of 'training' when my son first started to use this Foogo to ensure he always closed down the lid after he was done drinking... if the lid is open it will totally leak if it's knocked over.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"My daughter first used this when she was only 2.5 months old (pretty advanced so neck was strong already). She seemed very serious when ever she was in there. She wanted to touch everything but didn't seem to understand it was play time.Now only 2 weeks after having it, she can play in it for 30-60 mins at a time!!!! She happily goes in it 3x a day. That gives us time to eat, talk, clean, etc. She smiles as soon as she goes in. She's really good at jumping around too. I think it has helped her leg muscles and even neck by quite a bit. She's very strong for a 3-month old (was able to turn from tummy to back at 2.5 months) so I wouldn't recommend this for every 3 month old but I'm sure it'll be super fun when they are strong enough. I know she'll love this thing until she starts walking! Super funny to see how much fun this tiny (12 lb) baby has in this thing. She knows how to play with some of the toys and also know how to turn herself so def easy for a baby to navigate. We just put a blanket under her seat (so she can reach toys), pillow under her feet (stands tippy toed) & pillow at her back (push her forward). I wish they would make the seat come lower because some younger babies are able to enjoy it already but just can't reach. I don't care. Still a 5-star.Worth every penny. Your child will love it so stop doing research and just buy it!",5
The First Years 100 Count Pacifier Wipes,"My cousin bought me the gumdrop bottle set for my baby and gave it to me at my baby shower. It was the set that came with the small pack of pacifier wipes. Let me just say they are great. They smell good and although I am unsure if they taste good, they get his pacifier's clean and he seems to have no trouble with the taste when we stick the pacifiers back in his mouth. I actually use them to clean all the things he puts in his mouth like when we're on the go and don't have water or soap I use them for his bottles. I think they are great and bought this one because I was scared that once we'd run out of the smaller pack we wouldn't have any left to clean his pacifiers with. I also use the smaller pack for on-the-go so I store them in his diaper bag and this set we keep at home so we always have some with us when we need them.",5
Carter's Carter's 5 pc DB Set (Black w/Sage Trim),Wife bought this and loves it. We use the little bag for short trips and the big one for longer trips. Its been few months now and she loves it.,5
Sassy Sensation Station Suction Toy,Great toy!  Love it for my grandson!  Keeps him busy playing and he enjoys it too! I would recommend to buy.,5
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary",And they fit perfect and seem to be good for little ones. Simple straightforward design. Best part is the handles and how it sits over the seat. Highly recommend them.,5
"Bumbleride Indie Twin Stroller, Lava",I did a ton of twin-mom polling before I bought this - I am completely satisfied!  For walking outdoors and indoors it is amazing in terms of smoothness of ride/push and of maneuverability.  I only wish I would have bought it sooner!,5
"Safety 1st Snack and Scribble Booster Seat, Yellow","This is very poorly made. For a company called Safety 1st, this booster seat is VERY unsafe. the rear strap that attaches to a chair does not remain secure. The seat harness is strangely placed, not very secure and hard to operate. I never succeeded in attaching the tray to the seat. i would think that anyone who makes things for babies would understand that one hand operation is key. the seat back requires 2 hands to fold up. Overall, the idea of the magna-doodle-esque tray is great. The shape stamper is not attached though and would get lost, or be thrown on the floor so many times, any mom would probably just throw it away. Was this thing tested before being marketed? If so, did they use chimpanzees? Mine is going back today.",1
Dex Products Universal Safe Sleeper Bed Rail,"This bed rail is advertised as an adult bed rail, but when box came it said child's bed.  It was too small and light weight for adult bed. It works well for a child if that's what you need.",1
"The First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce","We purchased these bottles for our primarily breastfed baby based on the wide based nipple and good reviews. His latch on the nipple mimics breastfeeding well, and he has been going back and forth between the bottle and the breast successfully since 1 week old.However, both my husband and I have found that because of the way milk pools between the inner and outer nipple, it is essentially impossible to feed the last 1/2 oz or so. Even when we let it drip back down into the bottle and then quickly invert it again--you just can't get that last bit of milk to stay in the inner nipple long enough for him to drink it.I'm not willing to sacrifice 1/2 oz of milk everytime we use a bottle. We have retired these bottles and are now much happier with Tommee Tippee.",2
Bright Starts Bounce Bounce Baby Activity Zone,but shes trying to walk. not hard to put up or take down. but there are others so shop around,5
PRI Sleep Smart Folding Bed Guard Rail (White Mesh),"I wouldn't say this is the best product out there, but for the price it does serve its purpose.  I have never been able to get it lowered, eventhough it will, or I should say is suppose to.All in all, I am happy with it.  It does keep my son from falling out of bed at night.  We have it on a queen sized bed.",4
Bright Starts Bounce-a-Bout Activity Center,"Great activity center for the price.  Baby loved it.  It would have been better if it bounced.  It was supposed to bounce, but didn't.",3
"Playtex Drop-Ins System Original Nurser with 5 Liners, 8 Oz, [Aqua] (Pack of 3)",Great bottle! Easy to use and great for babies with gas!I like these MUCH better than the Playtex Wide Ventaires and they use they same nipple ;).,5
Sassy Ring O' Links Rattle Developmental Toy,This is an excellent toy that will grow with a baby. Take off all the links and you have a high contrast ring about 3 inches wide that is perfect for a newborn just beginning to hold a toy.  By three months this is perfect to practice passing between hands during midline play and then when the baby is a couple months older put the links on for a colourful rattle that they can mouth.,5
"Playtex Toy Story Insulator Cup - 2 pack, Colors and Styles vary","My 22 month old was destroying the spouts of his The First Years Take N Toss Sippy CupsThe First Years/Learning Curve Take & Toss Spill Proof Cups, 6 Pack, Colors May Vary , 7 Ounceas he would just chew on them with his strong teeth. So it was getting a bit of a hassle just to keep buying a new pack of those cups every week. I decided to let him pick another sippy and he chose these kind, but his have cars and trucks on them. I was afraid he might not drink from it because one time the local store did not have the see-thru colored take n toss cups but had a Toy Story design on them. When I would give them to him, he would refuse to drink from it.We did not have any problems changing to these new Insulator cups. He loves drinking from these cups. I just bought these a month ago and I need to find replacements now as he is wearing the spouts down again but at least they are more durable than the take n toss.Oh and they are really spill proof, more so than the take n toss. As long as you don't lay the filled cup down for a long time or shake the cup a lot with liquid inside, then no leaking issues. I was really hesitant to buy a different sippy cup since I tried to buy the least maintenance cup which was the take n toss. For the Insulator cup, however, you just have quick and easy steps of sticking the valve on the lid and twisting/clicking the lid on. It's not that bad at all. And washing it is not too much maintenance either. Just making sure to get the holes in the lid and the valve parts clean are a bit of a pain. it's still worth it though.",5
"Battat Mirror Pound-A-Ball Toy, Colors May Vary","This toy is awesome for all ages. I got it for my first son when he was 18 months and he still plays with it at 3 1/2! The only bad thing about this toy is that I have been unable to find replacement balls. It only comes with 4 balls and we have lost a couple of them. Other than that, it's a great toy.",4
"Graco Sarah Dressing Table, White",It was a sinch to put together and is very sturdy and well made. The shelves are spacious and can hold a lot of weight! It holds up to 30 lbs and does it well.,5
"Burlington Baby Wicker Hamper, White","Very light weight, but works well as a hamper.  You will need to put a laundry bag inside if you use it for your finer items as it has rough edges.  But, for the money, it is ok.",4
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","I read alot of reviews on this product and was very excited to have it...but honestly, am really disappointed I didn't read a review such as I have to offer about it. After only 10 minutes I would be in pain in my neck and shoulders and that was when my daughter was barely 2 months old.  I stopped wearing her in the Baby Bjorn around 5 months because it was just too much pressure on my shoulders.  I have since borrowed an Ergo Carrier from a friend. I can carry my 8 month old again at 17 lbs with no problem. The weight is much more balanced in my hips, lower back, and upper back and shoulders, that no one specific area feels it.  Ergo is easier to get baby strapped in. Can carry baby on back (with help getting them in). Also I have read that the proper position for babies is for their legs to be supported, not just dangling.",3
Funky Lines Double Bar Grip Covers,"I got these stroller sleeves for my Joovy Scooter stroller. The handles were really hard plastic. These are so comfy, stay on well and make our plain black stroller cute. I think I'll order more for our other stroller. Highly recommend!",5
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I bought this for my 2nd baby, thinking it'd be easier than warming a cup of water to warm the bottle.  Nope.  I could never get the amount of water and time right.  I just went back to a cup of water and this thing is sitting in a box.",2
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I bought this for my daughter who was about 20 weeks pregnant, and she was finally able to sleep through the night.",5
Tiny Steps 2-in-1 Walker With Mini Maestro,"We bought this walker because it will come apart for minimal storage space and because it was a two-in-one walker.  It was too tall for my tall daughter and we had to put a large book underneath.  She cannot move it on the low carpet yet at 6 months of age, but can use it outside on concrete and on linoleum.  The turning radius is not very great, but the music is enjoyable.  She gets frustrated that nothing can be pulled into her mouth, but still enjoys playing with the toys that are available.  She really enjoys the exersaucer with all the toys that are so reachable and that can be pulled to the mouth.",3
"Kokopax City Carrier, Gumdrops","I was worried about purchasing a backpack carrier for my 13 month old son.  He weighs 24lbs and I am 5'2"" and 115lbs.  This carrier is perfect if you are shorter.  It also fits my husband well at 6'0"".  It is lightweight and distributes the weight on your shoulders well.  The straps are a little wide, but overall is it comfortable.  My son has loved it so far!  We are looking forward to walks on vacation, sightseeing, and around the neighborhood walking the dog.FYI - If you are buying for a boy, I was surprised when I ordered ""bubbles"" and part of the pattern is lavender.  Hard to see until you're up close in person.  From farther away it looks more gray, so we are keeping it.",5
"Safety 1st OnBoard 35 Adjustable Infant Car Seat Base, Black",We needed a second car seat base for my husband's car and were greatful to come across this for such a great price!,5
Pearhead Babyprints Photo Frame,Looks really good and it was easy to use for prints.,4
"green sprouts Cornstarch Dumbbell Rattle, Pink","I love that this is made out of sustainable materials, and doesn't have chemicals like BPA. My daughter was interested in this toy for a little bit because of the rattle sound and the colors, but it's hard for her to hold (she's 3-months). The shape of the middle section would be better rounded (it's flat).",3
Summer Infant Slumbersack Sleeveless Microfleece - Pink Flower Print-Small/Medium,"I really like this sleep sack.  It was a great price, a cute print, and the fleece is really soft.  I also like the cut of it, since it is narrower at the top it really helps it to stay in place and not ride up near the baby's face....My only complaint is that it runs a tad on the small side, especially length-wise.  I wasn't able to use it long because of this, and I really wish I could find this same print in the larger size....",4
"Evenflo Featherlite 200 with Embrace35 Travel System, Gears","Love the car seat. Good design, easy to adjsut the harness (just pull one strap on the front near the baby's legs). Simple to get in and out of the base.Stroller is just ok. Steering issues when pushing with 1 hand (which we all need to do from time to time!), seems a little on the flimsy side, but the car seat fits in nicely and it gets the job done, but not a 5 star worthy set-up.",4
"Extra Large 40&quot;x30&quot; Absorbent Hooded Towel, Monkey, Frenchie Mini Couture","I wasn't expecting much from this towel - it has a monkey on it, and my toddler LOVES his monkeys. Being the spoiled kid he is, I bought it for him (we also needed a second hooded towel for him for when the other is in the wash, but shhh don't tell him that!).I received it and was surprised at how heavy it is. Compared to another brand, it's got quite a bit of bulk. More to absorb the water! It is SLIGHTLY scratchy as we don't use fabric softeners or dryer sheets on anything for our eczema prone little guy, but it absorbs water likes a pro, and I like that the ears curl a little after the first wash.The hood is also big enough that my one year old can play peek a boo while I dry him off and gets his lotion on. PERFECT! Distracted toddlers are the BEST to lotion up.I'd like it to be a little longer, but I'd like that in every hooded towel we buy, and every regular towel for that matter. I've taken to buying bath sheets for my hubby and I, and I'm sure I'll do the same once my boys are old enough to not want a hooded towel anymore.",4
"Boppy Pillow with Luxe Slipcover, Monkey",Comes in handy but something that I thought I would need but was actually uncomfortalble and a little akward to use.  I would buy it only if it was to use as somewhere to sit the infant but not as a nursing aid.,3
Sassy Pop n' Push Car,WELL MADE AND COLORFUL BUT I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING THAT POPPED A LITTLE MORE AND LARGER MARBLES.  I DON'T THINK IT'S EXCITING ENOUGH FOR AN 8/9 MONTH OLD CHILD.  MAYBE I'M WRONG BUT WE WILL SOON FIND OUT.,3
"Baby Einstein Press and Play Pal Toy, Neptune","Super cute, love the music it plays..i thought i was a little bit bigger but that is not and issue.",5
"Ulubulu Universal Pacifier Clip, Princess","Very cute design, well made. I would prefer it was an inch or two longer, but overall the length is fine. The clasp is pretty hard to open but that being said, it will prob never fall off your baby's clothes!",4
green sprouts Organic Blankie Cool Soothing Teether-Rose,"My son is four months old and teething.  He really likes this teether blankie, it's small so it's easy for him to hang onto it.  I chill the ring in the refrigerator before giving it to him, but he chews on the entire blankie.  I like that it doesn't contain any harmful toxins.",5
"Boppy Pillow with Luxe Slipcover, Teddy Bears",Very nice thing to have... I think it won't only be my baby who will enjoy this pillow but also me!!! It's very comfortable!!!,5
"aden + anais 3 Pack Muslin Snap Bib, Jungle Jam","let's be real here, i purchased two packs of these because the price was cheaper than the other designs, however I already had another set and they work better than any other brand of bibs.  My son spits up quite often and these are perfect for catching all the spittle.  they are a bit pricey but to me, they are the only ones that work.",5
Philips AVENT Infant Feeding Set,"I got a lot of avent bottles for my baby shower so I decided I would try using this brand over the rest of them.  After a week of them leaking all over everything I gave up and switched to Playtex with drop-ins.  My son hated the Avent ones, he was very gassy with them also.  Once I switched to Playtex things improved right away.Some good points:  they are easy to clean and you can use them in a bottle warmer but other than that I can't stand the leaking and the fact my baby was so gassy.",2
2 pk Sorrento Stroller Cup Holder Multiuse Snack Caddy By Carry You,"i was looking for something to hold my coffee cup while i was grocery shopping. this works pretty well. fits my cup, stays put for the most part, easy to carry w/me when i'm not using it. i'm going to try it out this summer on my backpack w/my water bottle. i'm sure it will work well for that too. happy w/purchase!",4
Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Reversible Napper &amp; Changer - Omni,For grandson when he comes over-  first thought the top thing was nothing we would use- turns out for a new born thats one of the best features.  still not so sure about the packn part.,5
Carter's Jungle Jill 30&quot; X 40&quot; Rug,"I did not order the ""Jungle Jill"" bedset for my granddaughter to be's room but it was pretty much the same theme but called ""Sassy Safari"" & this rug goes PERFECTLY with the ensemble!!! The threading, craftmanship, & colors are GREAT, BRIGHT, & CHEERY!! ;))",4
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"I purchased these cushions almost 4 years ago for my coffee table and to put on the corners of my kitchen island. The adhesive has worked great for us. It has been picked at and pried at by many many many little fingers and is still there!  The corner guards on the underside of the kitchen island finally came off after 3 years of lots of repeated picking (and my 4 year old almost immediately bumped his head on the bare corner and required a stitch!). I have tried every other kind of double sided tape to re-adhere them, but they will not stay put.  Although the adhesive that comes with the product may be difficult to work with initially, it has great staying power compared to other products. I have just ordered a new set of these to get a fresh set with new adhesive. It's a lot cheaper than the emergency room!!! Also it is one of the only options to safeguard the corners on something like a kitchen island.",5
Puj Snug - Ultra Soft Spout Cover (Aqua),"Really cute, simple spout cover that doesn't scream &#34;babyproofing&#34; for those of us who favor a clean, grownup design aesthetic. if you put away the bucket of bath toys, of course.",4
Biltmore Bunvelope Diaper Clutch - Sweet Potato Orange / Creamy White Circles - Great for Travel and On-the-go - Can Hold up to 3 Diapers - Free Butipod Wipe Case Included - Made in USA!,"I gave this as a gift to a friend and she was really pleased. It does look very much like a clutch purse, and we stocked it up before we gave it to her and it fits a few diapers and wipes and some diaper cream with room left over for her keys,  a compact, cash and cards for a quick trip without lugging the whole diaper bag.The yellow is subtle and the grey is a taupe-grey that is very neutral and went well with her style.The item arrived quickly with no packaging issues and was exactly as described. Thanks!I don't know about longevity yet, but if this lasts a while for her I will upgrade to 5 stars!",4
"Fisher-price - Carryall Diaper Bag, Brown","This bag is okay. I loved it at first however after about six months of normal wear and tear it doesn't loo so great. The wipe case that comes included is junk, the wiped that we put in there dried out in one day. This happened more than once so instead we just put a bag of wipes i there. the top cover is a zipper and Velcro. The Velcro does not stick too well. Other than those issues it is an okay diaper bag.",4
Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Bottle Starter Kit,"Dr. Brown's has great merchandise, no doubt. I am fnding that a bottle is just a bottle. As parents and grandparents, we need to hold the bottle just &#34;so&#34; for the baby to not ingest extra air. This bottle is no miracle. Please just buy any regular bottle and enjoy your feedings with your baby/grandbaby.",3
"Kissa's Pail Liner, White","Bought this to save a few more bucks than a different brand, but should have went with the different brand with tons more reviews.I was excited the day it arrived at my door. I wanted to use it right away, but upon taking it out the plastic case, it stinked so bad, and it was wet! I washed it first, but it takes a day and a half to dry. It still smelled so horrible. Finally, I used it on my clean dry pail. When it was wash day, the bag was so wet! It wicked like crazy and the bag stinks despite many washes. Not even my gCloths has a hint of smell on them.I returned it and paid an extra five bucks for a different brand.",1
Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Purse,Bought this for Xmas stuffer for my 9 month old. She is teething like crazy n I thought this is cute to chew on. The purse has little beads in it but I think she has not even paid any attention to it. The two extending toys r easy to grasp n bite on. One has a little mirror but it's so little that she has not even notice she can see herself in it. Easy toy to play with.,4
Summer Infant Little Looster,"This really is an ideal potty step. No more worrying about your little one falling off the step when they are dancing in front of the potty with their pants around their ankles. It's a little pricey, but I don't mind rewarding an innovator. There are a lot of (cheaper), but sub-standard competitor products out there. I'm glad we have a couple of these for our little girl--and her baby brother, in a couple of years!",5
GREAT IDEA !!! COMBO PACK !!! Baby LCD Digital Thermometer Body Temperature Fever Thermometer AND Cherry Flavored Flavorplus Natural medication Flavoring Drops for Kids Bad Taste Medicines,i loved the flavoring drops . i used a few drops into my sons bitter antibiotic and he was finally able to take it hassle free and he recover so much quickly,5
KidsKit Pelican Bath Toy Storage Pouch | Bath Toy Organizer,Most bath toy pouches I've seen suction cup to the bath tub wall.  Our bath tub has a tile that suction cups don't stick to so we can't use these.  Instead I was storing bath toys in a drawer in our cabinet and always worrying about water getting in the drawer or mold and mildew if the toys didn't properly dry out.  This is the only solution I've found that works in our bathroom.  It's not a great product but it solves our problem.  The pelican bath storage pouch is kind of clunky and my 15 month old boys can break it apart and pull it off the tub wall.  Still I don't consider this a major problem because the parts are big enough to be safe and the children are always supervised in the tub anyway.  I'm more concerned with the toys being consolidated when they aren't in use and being able to properly dry out.  The net is a good way for them to air out and drip into the tub.  The net is also machine washable.,3
Bright Starts Grab and Stack Blocks,My baby loves the colors and the crinkle sound. It's very soft. Very light to hold for a 4 months baby.,5
"Nuby 10 Pack Hangers, Colors May Vary","I love these kids' hangers because1. They are the cheapest per hanger that I have found.2. They are rigid, and sturdier than other, more expensive hangers. They hold heavy jeans and coats with no bending or breaking. My kids have never managed to break one, even stepping on them, and3. Those ""universal clips"" fit on them well and stay put so I can hang my kids' pants and skirts on them. (I like to hang pants or shorts and a shirt together in an outfit so the kids can pick an outfit that is already put together for them,. This way, they get some choice but are not putting together crazy combinations on their own. )They work for baby sizes up to about a size 8 shirt. They are also not as slippery as some hangers because they have a little texture to them.It's too bad you can't specify color. I have two boys and a girl, so not a big deal for me. I just give the pink ones to my daughter. In the several orders of these that I have placed, I have received lots of light blue, some pink and some white. I guess you take your chances and can always return them if you end up with  pink for your boy.It really is the best hanger for the money, and I keep coming back for more!",5
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","Expecting kid number two any hour now, and need another diaper pail for the upcoming dirties.I like the Elite because it has the foot pedal for easy open. I find my hands to be full when I use this thing.How's it work with smell? Honestly, i've never had an issue. I make sure the diapers are wrapped pretty well and that's about it. It's worth cleaning out every other day if your kid is active, just to clear the area. I mean, it is poop - it's going to smell.We have this out in the open in the room and don't have a problem with unwanted aroma. Definitely enjoy this product and it can last through the diaper years.",5
"Sunshine Kids Stow 'N Go Car Seatback Organizer, Black",Nice size with good pouches. I gave it 4 instead of 5 b/c it does not stay tight against the seat!,4
"Pearhead Giraffe Growth Chart, Blue",I love the cute design and the fact that my daughter can leave her mark on her own growth chart!  I would recommend getting your child's actual measurement and then marking it on the growth chart rather than backing them up to it and drawing a line as is traditionally done.  This eliminates any errors from chart misplacement or wiggling.,5
Sassy Diaper Pins,"I use these to prevent the wash machine or dryer from swallowing my socks.I was tired of having mismatched socks. These baby pins can be expensive ('cause the baby industry takes advantage:~ )However, these are good quality and not expensive for what you get. Fast shipping too!",5
"Sassy Baby Food Nurser, Colors May Vary","I purchased these and the similar Nuby feeder. Let me first say DO NOT BOIL THESE TO STERILIZE THEM! I ruined both kinds that way. After reordering and doing a simple wash I used both brands and found the Sassy to waste far less food and create a better seal for less mess. I do like the attachments for the Nuby, but find them to be just a perk and not necessary. Great for on the go feedings and grossed out dads who don't like feeding infants!",4
"Graco Lauren Dressing Table, White","No complaints.  Can't comment on assembly ease/time b/c someone else did that for me, but I like it's simple look and the storage shelves underneath.",5
Green Sprouts Nail Brush,Exactly  what I was looking for. Soft enough to clean my 3 month old's nails gently and effectively in the bath tub.,5
"Dreambaby Bump Belt, Black","this bump belt does helps release me from driving, because my wife could take back the wheel. The belt is perfectly fit in my car, no more concern the safety belt will ever hurt mummy in driving seat.Great design.",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I so love this pillow, I bought it yesterday on a desperate whim.. I hadn't read the reviews but after weeks of terrible sleep and moaning and groaning, anything would be a miracle. So I'm proud to report that last night, at 29 weeks pregnant, I slept through the night, with the exception of my bathroom runs.. I feel better this morning then I have in DAYS!",5
"Trend Lab Flannel Crib Sheet, Pink","better than the previous cotton fitted sheet, as in warmer but not as soft and fuzzy as I would like.",4
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","I am very pleased with this cover.  It is very soft and fits the changing pad very well.  The color blue is very pretty, better then pictured.  I also think it is well made.  I have washed it and it hasn't shrunk or faded.",5
"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane",Great car seat. Like it a lot.,5
Under The Nile Green Bean Toy,"Although this toy is still a little bit too big for my 4 month old to grab, it's nicely made and quite larger than I expected. I like the fact that it is organic, so I don't worry as much when I catch my little one munching away at it. It would be fun if it could rattle, but overall, I believe it is worth the money. Cute!",4
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"I really wanted this belt to work, it looks so cute and feels comfy. The warm herbal pack is nice too but, it does nothing for my baby. I was hoping it would calm her down especially when she gets colicky or gassy but this little belt did absolutely nothing besides look cute.",2
Lamaze Discover the Sea Carousel Musical Crib &amp; Floor Toy,"I got this for my 8 month old, who previously had no soother or lights to fall asleep with. I was hoping it would help calm her when she woke up in the middle of the night, but we couldn't use it. It distracted her when she was trying to fall asleep, and she just pulled on the fish. I guess it was too much of a change. I think it would be good for younger babies who are not used to a particular sleep environment.Also, it would sometimes catch and make a loud clicking sound.",3
"Peace of Mind Two 900 Mhz Baby Receivers, Monitor","We thought we were paying for a good monitor, but have had problems with regular static, clicking at odd times, and a loud continual noise when the phone rings or when you place a call. Other than that, you can hear every movement and breath the baby takes. I have read reviews on other brands found customers who bought less expensive monitors that work without these problems. As a mother who is trying to get some sleep while keep an ear out for your child the last thing I want to do is battle the monitor to find the &quot;right&quot; position for it to function properly.I am trading ours in.",2
"Peg-Perego Prima Pappa Best High Chair, Paloma","We originally purchased a Peg-Perego chair for our first grandchild.  Yes, the chair holds the child.  Yes, it rolls around.  But from a cleaning perspective it is a total failure.  There are too many crevices, cracks, corners, folds, etc. to be able to clean the chair.  It will accumulate food and stuff that you will not be able to routinely clean.  If you want your child to spend its first years sitting in bacteria from old food this is the chair to get, if not you would be better off looking for one that is more cleanable.",1
Snugli Front and Backpack Carrier,"Bought this elsewhere and am now browsing for alternatives.  Was looking for the next step up from my soft newborn carrier.  This one seemed very sturdy and stylish, and the color was great for one who hates all of the cutesy and/or navy blue baby stuff from which we are normally forced to choose.  However, I was heartbroken to find it tough to use with my six month old - hard to believe that she would already be too big to make doing up the side closures practical, but that seemed to be the case (despite what Snugli's specs claimed), so hated to waste the money.  I'm thinking of getting someone to custom design me one!",2
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Storybook Projection Soother,"Even though my daughter loved her mobile, I sometimes felt that it distracted her more than it would help her go to sleep. So I started looking at other alternatives. I first looked for a crib soother, but even if it may sound stupid, I was concerned that it would make her turn her head too much, and was afraid it would hurt her. I even feared that it would encourage her to fall asleep on her side, or make her roll on her tummy, which scared me a lot since I was haunted by SIDS at the time.So I started looking at various ceiling projectors, and got this one because it was on sale at Target. I loved it right away since it would help my daughter fall asleep very easily, and as I was watching her in her room through my night-vision monitor, I could see how interested she was by the colorful pictures on the ceiling. I also loved the fact you can change the song/story, and how baby can change it himself when he gets old enough. And the songs are very sweet and for once, not all instrumental! This is a excellent alternative also for when baby can't use a mobile anymore because it becomes a chocking hazard, the only downside being that we can't use it during daytime before her room isn't dark enough then.However I bought another ceiling projector for my godson a few months later (he is a few weeks older than my daughter), because my sister couldn't find one she liked in France. The one I picked for him was the 'Fisher Price Luv U Zoo Crib N Go Projector' because I wanted something that he could still use when a toddler (bear in mind he was much older than the age my daughter was when I got a projector for her). That was a major mistake: he wasn't interested in it at all because of the images are too static, and there are only 2 of them. The Storybook Projector is much, much better even though it is not transportable. So if you hesitate between these two I recommend that you get the Storybook one.",5
"Dream On Me 3&quot; Extra Firm Portable Crib Mattress, White",,5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"Holds quite a bit of weight.  My kids have one filled about twice what the picture shows, and it's stretched out most of the way, but is showing no sign of breaking or falling.  I'm pretty happy with that.",4
Evenflo Summit Easy Walk-Thru Gate,"After years of having to step over gates I was thrilled that someone finally invented ones with a swing gate.  I bought these from someone who had toddlers but said she didn't need them... translation;  she had trouble with them, wanted them gone,and no longer had the boxes or instructions.  I thought it would be a simple install and yet it took me about 20 min to get the first gate up.  I liked the results but like many other reviewers found it difficult to open.After a few days of use it latched but would swing open as soon as I put any pressure against it.  Once I pulled up reviews [and did some closer inspection of the design] I figured how to make it much easier to install the next gate, and fix the problems with the first.  I also realized that if it was installed properly the red or green dot would line up in the hole on the gate.  I also learned that it may need some readjusting if the gate opens too easily.The biggest issue I had was getting it to fit in the door frame while tightening it.  One reviewer mentioned that the gate came with zip ties which were to remain on until the install was complete.  Had I known this it would have saved me time and a ton of frustration!  The next gate will definitely get zip tied first before I try to install it.I'd recommend this gate with some reservations regarding some difficulty with the latch.  It works but not always with just one hand as many other reviews have mentioned.",4
Especially for Baby Car Seat Travel Bag,It's the only one that matches with our baby car seat! VERY good size and material. It comes with a handle to place wherever you need.,4
Primo 4-In-1 Soft Seat Toilet Trainer and Step Stool White with Pastel Blue Seat,Good potty chair.  The baby likes to go on it herself and that's what we wanted.  It's easy to clean and can be used as a stand when we are done training.,5
Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Bottle Newborn Feeding Set,Great deal and I love these bottles. Easier to hold than the bulky ones and the nipples are soft - that's important for me...closer to the real thing for baby.,5
The First Years Two Receiver 49 MHz Monitor,"This is the second monitor set we have bought. We have two sets now. We really liked the set for our older child because it has a nightlight with it. This one does not. That being said, the range on this set is very good and the ability to work on two frequencies is a must for us.",4
Baby Jogger Car Seat Adapter for City Mini / City Elite,I bought a stroller/carseat adaptor at babies r us then when I tried to attach it to the stroller realized its not the same adaptor my best friend has for her identical stroller carseat combo. Hers snaps into place and feels much more secure than the one I had purchased. So I returned it. I came onto amazon and found the adaptor my friend had. Checked out all the pictures and yep it was the version she has she even verified it. So I bought it. Fast forward to opening my order several weeks later ( we didn't go anywhere for a while with our newborn so I didn't open it for weeks) and low and behold its the version I had returned to babies r us and NOT the one pictured on the amazon site. Soooo now I'm at a loss as to what to do. Do I suck it up and use the crappy one? I can't seem to find the version I like. I'm not sure why it was changed to this model. It doesn't feel secure and has bad ratings...I haven't opened the actual product box because if I do I can't return it. For now I'm using an old snap n go. Bleh!,1
Paci Plushies Paisley The Panda Pacifier,love this! I couldn't find anything like this to hold my avent paci's & this was perfect! It is much smaller than the soothie animals however so be prepared!,5
Stripes and Brights Scraptopus Toy in Multi Color,"I bought this for my 7 month old because he's teething and chewing everything in sight.  Since this is organic and non-toxic, I thought I'd feel better letting him suck and chew on this.  Well, simply put, he loves it!  As soon as I hand it to him, he'll lunge for it and attack its various tentackes or its face with his little mouth.  in fact, last night, I placed my baby into his playpen and when he saw scraptopus, he squealed then promptly picked it up and started gumming away.When this first arrived, I thought it was a little small (I would say about the size of a large grapefruit), but in retrospect, if it were larger, I think babies would have a tough time grabbing it.  The scraptopus is made of cotton, and the cover material is like a thin jersey knit.  Since my baby snogs it so much, it does get kinda wet and soggy, and like another reviewer said, it takes a while to dry.  However, when I wash it, I just throw it into the washer and dryer, and scraptopus comes out nice and toasty, not to mention a little lumpy, which is great because it's a bit more texture for the baby.  I initally thought that the price was a little steep for something so small, but it's totally proven its worth!",5
"Max Daniel Designs Satin Adult Throw Blanket, Champagne Rosebuds","The blanket looks exactly as it does in the picture. And it is amazingly soft! The reason that I gave it 4 stars though is because when I received it in the mail, the box was ripped and torn open all over the place and on the box it said one or more items fell out...fortunately, the blanket was still in there and it was wrapped in a plastic bag as well. I was determined not to wash it because I don't want the blanket to get ruined in any way. Also, I do think this blanket is way too pricey, maybe $100 but $150? Ehhhh, I bought it because I had money saved up. But other than those two things, I love it.",4
Samsung SEP-1001R Night Vision Additional Wireless Pan Tilt Zoom Baby Monitoring Camera for SafeView (SEW-3037),Ordered this with the video monitor for an extra monitor and it works very good.  Nice to be able to search around and see the whole room.,5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"After spending hours researching, we decided to purchase two Kidco Configure Gates (one around our crystal china cabinet and one in our family room). Worth every penny. Although a bit expensive, it has kept our 14 months old twin girls within the safety boundaries. We're planning to buy two more for the stairways.",5
Evenflo ExerSaucer Delux - Wild Thing,FIRST FIVE LA warns about all walker and similar toy because there is so many babies and children that comes to the hospital ever year with broken bones an other injuries after fall out of this kinds of toys. i know that it is attention but please stay away from this types of toys the are dangerous.,1
"Comfort &amp; Harmony Portable Swing, Penelope Petals","Bought this for my sister who lives in NYC. She only has a small 1 bedroom apartment and its perfect she can fold it up when it's not in use and stick it behind the couch! I myself also have on  for my twins and they both fit in it for the first month of their life, which was great! Great product that shuts itself off after a while to conserve battery which helps alot when you come to realise just how many batteries you go though with kids stuff!!!",5
Kidkusion Hearth Kushion Taupe,I do not recommend this product. The sticky Velcro did not stay attached to my brick fireplace and my 8 month old son was easily able to pull it off. I threw this away about 2 days after I got it.,1
BEABA First Stage Spoon Multi-Pack - Multicolor - 4 pk,"I would recommend these spoons. They are the perfect shape and nice design. They are a little pricey but I think worth the cost. I would purchase these again. This is our third Beaba product, the other being the freezer tray and food maker we received second hand. I never heard of this company before but my wife was impressed with the tray so decided to give these spoons a try (haven't used the food maker yet). I wish Beaba made more products than their current line.",5
"Joovy Scooter X2 Double Stroller, Greenie",Love it fits great in the SUV. Love it how it fits through every door ways. I use it every chance I get.,5
Tub Tattoos: Monkeys,"these little monkeys are soooo cute! and if you follow the directions on the package closely, you will have no troubles. i have had them for over a month now, an none of my monkeys have moved at all. and they are nice because they dont have that hard grit that hurts ur toes, but have good support, i think :)",4
Pee Puck-Makes Toilet Water Yellow for Days-Fake Pee Gag Gift,It's really good but takes a couple hours to activate but really is yellow. I recommend this to anybody who loves a good toilet prank.,4
Skip Hop Dash Deluxe Charcoal,"I adore this diaper bag. I like the simplicity of it. It has enough pockets, enough compartments. This wont hold much size-wise, but it holds mostly what I need for everyday outdoors. I like that it has straps made for strollers/stroller handles. This is its best feature for me. Maybe a slight con is the closure of the flap, its magnetic and not zipper. I guess they made this for easy access should you need to constantly grab stuff from inside but, it just doesn't make it too secure. Hence the 4star. I love that its all black and has adjustable shoulder strap. Seems sturdy. Wrote this review very late from the day I bought this diaper bag, months and months ago and it is still looking good.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for the Diaper Champ after reading many reviews for several different diaper pails.  This is by far the easiest product to use.  There are no complicated bag systems and no special replacement bags.  I have not had the problem of having any oppressive odors leak out into the room.  The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.  There is no such thing as a completely odorless plastic diaper pail since plastic absorbs odors, but just drop a couple of dryer sheets (Bounce or something similar) into the bottom of the diaper champ (not in the bag) and the odor disappears.  This product is easy to use and the bags aren't hard to change.  I would recommend this to anyone.",5
Touch-Me Textured Baby Flash Cards/Activity Toy,I received this a few days ago and thought it was a really great toy for an infant. My son is 14 mo old and he didn't seem very interested in it. He's really into touch and feel books and I thought he'd enjoy all the different textures and sounds. If he'd been younger I would have definitely kept it. Wish I'd have gotten this when he was smaller. I did like that you could take each card off and attach to stroller/car seat or whatever else. I would recommend this for the under one year old crowd.,4

But I plan to use them for nighttime, so they will be fine I'm sure.*Update* Wish I could return them. They are humongous and don't contain anything, not to mention noisy.",1
"Graco Pack 'n Play Element Playard, Metropolis","We found this pack and play to be very flexible and really like that we can use it as our child grows. It appears that most models don't have the two-level bassinet that this one has.  For the space we have it is a bit larger than expected, so it doesn't easily wheel in and out of rooms as we had hoped it would, but it is still not too much trouble to break-down and set up again. The music box mobile doesn't stay on very long after a full wind-up but that's a minor disappointment. Overall we are very happy with it's quality, ease of use, and functionality.",4
"Sunshine Kids Radian80 SL Convertible Car Seat, Primrose","Having owned two Britax seats and a Cosco, I can say without a doubt that this is the most difficult car seat to install.  In order to install it, we need to recline the seat back, then adjust the LATCH straps, because there is no way to adjust those straps once they are connected to the car.  The design for this most basic part of the seat is horrible to the point where it is just plain broken.The seat part has foam padding that feels just cheap, and has ""cracked"" on the edges from picking it up.If you're considering this seat, please look at a comparable Britax.  They are the best.",1
Taggies Colours Toss Plush toy,"My daughter is 5 months old and loves this!!  We hung it from her gym mat and she loves it!  She just kicks at it.  She will hold on to it too, but she likes the green taggies dog more to love on",5

Baba Buddy (Green),"If you are a mom and you don't have an extra set of arms, you need this. Don't delay. This doesn't replace you and isn't something I use exclusively but when I need to feed and drive at the same time or feed and cook, it makes it possible.",5
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black","Very sturdy with great compartments.  I got this to replace the BOB version, which has flimsy velcro that had fallen apart.  This one has thick, sturdy velcro to attach to the stroller - it's not going anywhere!",5
"Vulli So'Pure Teether, Sophie the Giraffe","I was so excited when I found Sophie here on Amazon for half the price that I was gonna buy her for. My baby loved it she's really soft and chewy for and the rings make it easy for her to grab it, although one thing that sucks is sometimes she gags on the rings so I have to turn the giraffe for her to bite the smaller side. But overall she's good rather than her putting other things in her moth",5
"Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 3 (Light Blue, Bright Blue, White)","They work great on holding a swaddle blanket in place for the time being, as our kiddo is too tiny for the cloth diapers yet. Given the material of the diapers compared to the swaddle blankets, I think these will work just fine.",5

BabyKicks Hemparoo Premium Washies - Slate Blue,"I normally just use dollar store washcloths as wipes But I decided to splurge and try these. I am so glad I did! These are the best wipes I have ever tried! They are so soft that my little one even carries one around as a travel lovey. They are a great size for wiping bottoms, and the pocket is great for keeping your hands clean. We even use one in the bathtub with a bar of soap in it Instead of using body wash. Use after use and wash after wash, they're still soft, even when dried on the line.  The slight nap of the fabric means they grip messes and pull them away with ease, And we simply turn them inside out when done wiping a bum. I also use one to wash my face, as it is softer and gentler on my skin then other washcloths I've tried.",5
"Boon Trunk Snack Box,Gray/Blue","As others have mentioned, the lid does not stay closed after opening once.  Carrying by the handle would lead to food tumbling out.",1

Lss than a year after purchase the receiver lost volume so the camera would turn on when it heard a noise but i couldnt hear it, so had to sleep with the doors open and be aware if my baby woke up.  I could see her but not hear her.",2
Fisher-Price Table Time Turtle Booster,"The chair is ok. We have another booster seat and I was planning on buying the same one (I think it is safety first and was about $15). I saw this seat and thought it was cute and cheap, so I decided to get it. I love the strap position and buckling in is very easy.  I was disappointed with how low the chair is. We have a 2.5 year old and she is very tall for her age but I feel the table is too high for her. Our other booster gets her higher.",2
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I've had no problems with the product. No shrinkage, no getting under the sheet, no bunching, etc. I LOVE the UCS and have bought it for MANY of my friends.You gotta have at least 2 though.",5

Malawi Chair,"We bought this for our little guy who is approx 15 months old.  LOVES IT!  Don't waste your money spending tons... this little chair gives you a lot of bang for your buck.  Durable, easy for little ones to climb in and out of (another favorite of the little kiddies since it's difficult for them to climb the couch!) and cute.  Not an eyesore!",4
"Britax Boulevard 70 Convertible Car Seat, Silver Birch","We love this car seat but it is very disappointing that Britax cannot include a cup holder. For the price they charge for the carseat a cup holder must be standard. After we bought the cupholder and installed it, it seems that the deign is not ideal. It sticks out too much so if the carseat is installed in the middle, the person next to it cannot seat comfortable. also it seems not ideal for toddlers that are in a lower part of the height chart as they may have hard time reaching out for the cup.Taking the fabric out to was is relatively easy as well. We washed it couple of times in cold water and air dried it but it seems to be fading already.",4
SoHo Deep Sea Aquarium Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"The materials seem high quality for this crib set, however, the picture they show does not show the exact colors. Underneath the comforter is a bright lime green color, and everything else is pretty much lime green too! Do you see that in any of the pictures they show you? I don't! The set is A LOT brighter than the pictures show. Judging by the pictures, I assumed the set was pastel. The bib is the kind you have to tie in back, not a velcro one which I would think is much safer than the tying kind they send you in the set.  Well worth the price though. Much cheaper than any other place online. I'm expecting with a girl, so we'll see how the bright lime green and dark blue and plaid look in a purple room. :/",4
"Europa Baby Geneva Convertible Crib, White","Pros-Great price-Arrived without any dents/scratches-Easy assembly, took less than an hour-Sturdy & looks greatCons-The top back piece wasn't flush with the back rail after the assembly was complete. (its cosmetic, I'm just real picky) Its screwed as tight as possible, but there's still a tiny gap on one side and not the other.-Finishing on the front bars aren't as smooth as I'd like. Feels like they painted/finished it without sanding the wood down.Baby isn't born yet, so won't know how this crib holds up in the long run. Will update if there are any durability issues...",4
"Kushies &quot;On the Go&quot; 2 Pack Wet Bag, Green  (Patterns and Colors May Vary)","These are great for use with cloth diapering.  I'm not sure the """"large"""" description is what I would describe as large but...it does the job.",5
Bath Toy Bag ~ Garden,"I purchased this bath toy bag because it was a prettier one than the plain blue and white ones and because it matched my daughters bathroom decor. It was also twice as expensive (around $20 instead of $10).  However, it proved to not stick to the bathroom wall very well.  One of the suction cups did not work very well at the beginning and the longer I have had it the worse it got.  We have had it a long time now, but now it doesn't stick to the wall at all.  I thought maybe I overfilled it with toys, but even after emptying it out it doesn't stick.  Maybe should have purchased a cheaper one instead (even if it didn't 'match').",3

We've tried many types of cups, most recently the Playtex insulated cups which claim to be leak-proof but very much aren't. These Nuk / Gerber Graduates cups, however, are the real deal. If you're looking for a truly leak-proof cup, as long as you don't need an insulated cup, these are the best.",5
"Graco Pack 'n Play Quilted Playard Sheet, Light Blue","I am glad I got this to add to our pack and play. it is soft to the touch and adds a little bit of cushion to an otherwise hard pack and play bassinet bottom. It fits VERY snugly on the pack and play base, which is a good thing. Just a bit annoying to change at 3am when there was an accident on it, but really not that big of an inconvenience. I'd rather it be snug than not.",5
"Luvable Friends 3-Pack Flannel Receiving Blanket Set, Pink","These receiving blankets were very thin, no heming around the blanket just a whip stitch  which is easily pulled and does not go back.

HABA Kringelring Rattle Clutching Toy,"I bought this thinking it would be great for our 4 month old to bang around and chew on since she is teething early. She definitely likes it as a rattle (tons of fun when you slip it on her wrist). But as a teether its a little too thick. Very durable, colorful toy that will last forever...just serving a different purpose than what i originally intended.",3
Cloud B Tranquil Turtle - Aqua,"I got this after lots of price/review comparisons, and had pretty high expectations for it.  Here are the pros and cons for me:Pros:Nice sounds, not overwhelming or annoying - nice that you can choose no sound.Good light features - not too bright/dim, not too fast or slow, nice that you can make it still or wavy, realistic water patternsGood area coverage - I put it in my kids' rooms when they go to sleep (which are smaller) then take it into the master bedroom when I'm ready for bed.  As long as it is in the middle of the room at about 6 feet down from the ceiling (like it says to do), with no obstructions around the sides, it covers the whole ceiling, plus lots of the walls!The timer is 23 minutes (or close to that) so I don't have to worry about it running all night, though I do wish it had different time settings so I could run it longer/shorter or continuously if I wanted.Cons:The actual bulb is very bright, especially in a dark room - I have to pile a blanket in front of it so that the actual turtle isn't in my line of sight or it's very distracting.The wave motion is kind of jerky (it's basically the bulb rotating and it has small mechanical jerks which show up quite obviously on the ceiling).  But its actually not too hard to look past IMO.Basically, I find this product very soothing and pleasing - it has met all my expectations, and even though there are a few annoyances, they are easy to fix/get over.",5

DEX Products Grab N Go Bottle Warmer BWC-01,"I agree that if you are going to a restaurant or coffee shop, it's easy enough to just ask for some hot water to heat a bottle.  And I agree that this IS heavy to add to an already heavy/full diaper bag, BUT it also keeps baby's bottles toasty warm so they're ready when she is, which saves crying & stress of trying to find hot water or a place to sit & nurse - this is easier in the car & in the grocery store or mid-mall.  Boiling it for 15 mins. after we're home is no big deal at all - just put in boiling water, set a timer, take it out & it's ready to go for the next time you're out on the go.",4
Eddie Bauer Car Seat Protector,The item that was pictured and described when I placed my order for this car seat proctector last week is NOT correct! It describes the exact same protector that I purchased several years ago which is why I wanted to purchase another one seeing as I'm expecting in the next couple months. The protector I ordered (as described) is BLACK with two GREY stripes down the middle and the one I received is BLACK with LIME GREEN stripes. Yuck!!! Very dissappointed!,3
"NUK BPA Free Pacifier Carry Case, Colors May Vary","Bought these to tote along our son's NUK pacifiers.  We can fit this on the skinniest part of the Chicco carseat handle so it's always there when baby boy gets fussy and wants his paci.  This container has holes for ventilation.  It easily fits two or three of the NUK pacifiers.  We've been using this container on a daily basis for 4+ months and its held up very well.  Being plastic its also very easy to clean very well, unlike those fabric paci holders that I also considered.  If your baby uses a NUK pacificer, you should definitely check this case out.---updated 1/11/12.  Bought a 2nd case to keep in my car, so that we'll always have a clean, safe way to keep our baby's pacifier handy.",5

It is sturdy and while we don't encourage her to push on it, we have confidence that it will not break, especially with the extra bar in place.  The locking mechanism is easy to use and lowering the rail is simple and smooth.  We don't see that it would be any better to have the rail slide under the mattress - seems we probably wouldn't do that very often. The only downside is that the mesh got a small hole in it rather quickly.  Not sure how it happened, but we would have liked a mesh that was a bit more tear resistant.  Have to see how that holds up, but this rail has served us well so far.",4
"Thirsties Duo Wrap, Honeydew, Size Two (18-40 lbs)","I have used these for the last year or so and they're still together and working great.  I shove two diapers in it for nap time and it fits over them great.  They're durable too.  I used Imse Vimse before and really liked them, but these are so much cheaper and work just as well.  I really like that they work with any diaper you have on hand, not just some special shape or type.",5
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange","I have researched baby strollers for months.  Baby Jogger by far is my favorite with their easy one hand fold and other features.  I had my eye on the City Elite until I saw the City Mini GT was coming out.  It is such a great hybrid between the City mini and Elite strollers.  Still within most peoples comfort level with weight and compact fold.I was able to compare the Elite and GT side by side at the store.  The wheels on the GT, all though smaller are still great for all terrain.  The GT sun canopy seemed just a bit bigger then the Elite.  I won't repeat the comments of the Velcro vs magnets on the windows for the GT.  Hopefully they will fix that in the next model.One huge difference is the support in the seat.  I asked the sales lady if they had added the back board to the GT stroller when they assembled it and she said it came that way.  The Elite caves in a bit and I would imagine that as your child gets older they may sink a bit.  The GT has an added plastic piece in the seat and the back that gives a really nice support.  I was really impressed by that and I havn't seen anyone commenting on that in any of the reviews.They have changed the fabric on the 2012 Elite and it is a much thicker and stiffer canvas.  I have read that some people are already finding it more difficult to clean.  The GT fabric seems like it would brush off better and not be as hot either.  I asked the sales lady about the fabric but I think she had reached her limit with my questions :).The weight is really noticeable between the Elite and GT.  The Elite was a bit challenging to fold and unfold and I felt like I had to put it on the ground.  When I was going to unfold the Elite I felt like I would of course rather it not touch the ground before I unfold it.  I tried to imagine doing so in a parking lot and I wouldn't want the fabric to get filthy.  I suppose one would get used to how to open it quickly over time.  The Elite was just heavy enough that I had to put it on the floor and then open it.  With the added locking latch I just couldn't hold the stroller with one hand and unlatch it with the other.  The GT was easy peasy.  I didn't need to put it down to open it at all.  It is so much easier in the way it opens and closes compared to the Elite.I love the feature on the Elite with the raised kicker.  Also that the footrest is a durable plastic.  However when studying the GT and Elite today I noticed a subtle difference.  The leg drop length is slightly longer on the GT then the Elite.  I have always leaned toward the Elite as I felt the footrest would last longer being plastic and a taller child would fit better.  (not be as scrunched with their legs) However now that I have compared them I would rather have the longer leg extension drop then to have the plastic piece of the Elite.  Both are going to get dirty and at least you can throw the whole seat of the GT in the washing machine.I wheeled both strollers through the store and of course the GT was easier to manage as it is more narrow.  Both strollers really glide, I love that about Baby Jogger.  The front wheel suspension on the GT is the same spring action as that of the Elite.Overall, the GT is as everyone has mentioned, a great blend of the City mini and Elite.  I am so sold on the GT, sad to say it but I think the Elite is just a bit to big.  I love the features of both but the GT is now my favorite :)",5
"Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","This is a wonderful product, so much better than the tissue covers a few restrooms offer or that are available at drugstores in the travel section.  I have 2 daughters (2 year and 5 years old) this is a must have item in our backpack!  The cost may seem steep for some and the environmentalist in me wants to say ""no"" to additional paper/plastic products, but by the time I get done toliet papering the seat or using enough tissue covers to make it comfortable for my girls I have wasted more than using just one of these seat covers.  Extra tip that we found when we were potty training our little ones, we also ripped the potty seat cover off the toliet seat when done and placed on the floor to stand on the face-up side while putting our pants or pull-ups back on, no yucky restroom floor in sock/bare feet!",5
The First Years Newborn-to-Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat,"We have 8 month old twins and wanted to buy one chair and try it out before buying the second.  We like this chair, it certainly helps to save space, we haven't had any problems with it at all.  The removable cloth is handy, although it would have been nice if it had a more waterproof finish on it, because it absorbs everything.  The tray is simple to adjust, and the child is easily secured.  We have just ordered the second one and can't wait until we receive it.",5
"Jeep All Weather Umbrella Stroller, Ice Pink","Great buy.  My daughter loves this stroller.  I like the option of the back padding that you can fold during hot season so the air can go though.  Your child never gets hot or sweaty at their back.  I would recommend this stroller.  maneuver really well, I can do it with my 1 hand, fold one hand.  Great, great stroller.",5
Redmon Fun and Fitness Exercise Equipment for Kids - Tread Mill,"Terrible product.  My children never rode it.  The reviews regarding the smell are accurate.  Horrible chemical smell.  It does eventually go away, but what is it and what will you be breathing in, in the meantime?  There is a dial for resistance, but this didn't work and the ride was very loose pedaling so that there was no resistance at all, which made it generally unpleasant to use.",1

The First Years Star Teething Blanket,"We had gotten this toy as a gift four years ago for our older daughter and was recycled for our second daughter.  She loved it.  And then we lost it and needed to find it again.  Through an extensive search online (since we didn't know the name or manufacturer) we finally found it!  It is the perfect toy for an infant.  It's squishy, so it is easy to hold onto.  One of the star ends has a squeaky part, for fun noises.  It crunches, it's silky and the blue star end is rubbery for teething.  It has everything you can ask for and is machine washable.  What a wonderful toy!",5

SnoozeShade Plus - The Universal Fit Stroller Sunshade (UPF50+),"I have a 17 months old daughter who often fights me on her nap - sometimes it's just better to get out of the house, take a stroll, let her get some fresh air... and hopefully doze off for an hour or so!  After getting the shade, I viewed the how-to video on YouTube but it was really simple to put around the stroller, unzipping on the top to let more air in for warmer weather, it fit my Bugaboo Bee plus stroller perfectly and most importantly my daughter napped for 1 and half hrs in it!!!  I recommend this product to any parent who had taken a stroll outside to help their child nap - which is every parent I know.",4

We've had these for almost a year and they have worked great.",5
"BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Booster Seat, Gray/Black/Green",I bought this chair after having several experiences dining out where no high chair was available.  This booster is great for carrying anywhere!  It folds flat and fits in my diaper bag. I take it everywhere we go where I know we'll be eating. It is also great for traveling out of town too.  We often go places where our hosts don't have a spare high chair.,5

Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System Complete,"These are great because they don't leave the gap that the hooks do for little fingers to get pinched in. Installation was easy enough and the fact they can be """"disarmed"""" is a huge bonus. The biggest challenge was getting the other half to put the magnet key back in the same spot each time. ; )",5

"Leveret Bib (X-SMALL (6-18 Months), Flowers)","This bib is the greatest bib EVER!! This is for my 2 yo. I purchased the 3-5T for room to grow. The sleeves are long but I just roll them up. Easy on and off. Easy to clean, you can wipe it off, rinse it off or throw in the washer if real dirty. Cleans well & holds up in the washing machine. I dry it for a few mins then hang dry. Dries quickly. Has 2 pockets at the bottom. I wish it was made w/ 1 big pocket to catch thefgood. It would make it easier to clean out the catchings. Bib is well worth the $10. Would be a great gift. Will be purchasing more to keep at relatives house & on the go. Wish I knew about this bib sooner!!",5

Very sturdy and I like that the bottom is anti-slip. The little holes on the sides made it easy to move, even for my son's little hands.",5
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),I got these as little Christmas gifts and they were a big hit!  Love to have a stimulating head massage!  Great relief for those New Years Day headaches!,5
"Kushies Baby 4 Piece Bath Mat and Squirter Set, Jungle","I got this for my almost 3 year old and he absolutely LOVES it!  As do I, because my son has a tendency to always want to stand in the bath tub.  Now if he stands I'm not afraid of him slipping and falling over.  This bath mat also comes with 3 really cute squirt toys which no matter how old you are, are always super fun and amusing!!  Over all I rate this 5 stars because it is not only super cute and looks great in my bath tub it is also very useful!!  I would highly recommend!  Oh and also it doesn't seem to have that really strong plastic smell like so some other bath mats I have purchased!  *An added bonus!!",5
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","Bought this gate a month or two ago to help my mom keep her dogs in a back room whenever she went out. This gate is very nice and fit very well in the doorway and looks great too. The color isn't too noticeable, so you don't notice it so much. The door has a bit of a small width, but hasn't been too much of an issue so far. Never had one of these gates so thought it wouldn't be very stable and would just fall over, but once it was put in, it is actually very stable. My mom's dogs are pretty big, but I think it can be used for smaller dogs too. I got it for a bit of a discount, but would definitely recommend this if you need a quality indoor gate for your dog.",5
Evenflo Soft N Wide Gate,"Bought 2 of them worked great, nice looking and neutral colors.  Had an odd shaped area and the gate fit and easy to step over for a 5'2&#34; person",5
Warm as a Lamb Single or Jogging Stroller Cover Black,"We read a lot of the reviews for this product before buying it - some did not like the zipper quality ( 2009 covers).I have to say that I am VERY pleased with this product! The zipper quality is heavy duty. I had no problems assembling it into my stroller, I was worried about fitting it in my single jogger stroller(from baby trend) but I was pleasantly surprised! It has straps on the bottom so you can pull and adjust the fitting to your stroller. I Highly recommend it to parents! If you live in areas where snows, rains or is windy this cover is a PLUS. Bottom line, my daughter stays nice and warm inside this stroller cover. Well worth the money for us!",5

"aden + anais 2 Pack Muslin Burpy Bib, Princess Posie","We own the original ones sold from Aden+Anais and we also own ones from Aden+Anais for little77 (American Eagle Outfitters). There is a world of difference between them. While the ones for AE are cheaper ($15 for two) the ones sold directly under the A+A brand are much higher quality AND they are bigger too. They really do get softer the more you wash them, and while the instructions say ""wash cold"" I throw them in on warm and they hardly shrink and come out clean AND super soft.$20 might seem a lot of money for bibs, but they are totally worth it. 4 layers of muslin lets nothing through and they are very versatile. I love the snaps as no velcro messes up clothes in the wash.",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",I read lots of reviews before purchasing this monitor. My grand daughter is now 11 months old and I watch her during the day while her parents are at work. During the day she takes two naps. She always wakes happy but before the monitor I did not hear her until she cried. Now I am able to clearly hear when she wakes and begins playing with her crib toys and am able to respond before she becomes stressed. Also I know exactly when she drifts off to sleep. There is occasional static but it is very low. My daughter-in-law spent a lot more money for something not nearly as good. In my opinion for the money this is the absolute best product on the market hands down.,5
"Boon Flair Pedestal Highchair with Pneumatic Lift,White/Orang","I really like this high chair! It is really nice to be able to roll it around. I also have 3 other children, and it would be nearly impossible for them to knock it over which is why I chose this one in the first place. The reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because of the space in the seating. There is very little space between where you buckle the seat and the baby. My baby is a little chunky, but I know he will lean out and it won't be a problem. He is 20 lbs at 7 months just to give you an idea. I read another post about this, and that lady took hers back because of it. If you aren't worried about the space, it is an awesome high chair!",4
"Sorelle Cape Cod Crib and Changer with Toddler Rail, French White","Bought this crib at an awesome price compared to other retailers at the time.  Was shipped to me via freight...box was slightly damaged, but as mentioned in a previous review, it is packaged very well thus no damage to the parts inside.  The instructions were very confusing (parts not labeled other than a poor diagram of the parts in the instruction manual, and images of how to put it together could have been better as well).  If you have a hard time putting together Ikea furniture you will most likely have a hard time trying to get this put together.  It took me approximately 3 hours to put it together (and I'm good at assembling Ikea furniture), but it is definitely worth it in the end.  I felt the hardest part was attaching the crib portion to the dresser/changing table section.  That took most of our time because some of the parts on the changing table are loose until you attach it to the crib section.  When we went to attach it parts would slide out of place and we would have to go back and reattach it a couple of times before we got everything into place.  Other than that, it's a very nice quality crib and love the ability for to convert it into toddler bed/full bed.  I also like how the changing table can convert into a dresser with the full bed so you can still make use of it as the child grows.  I highly recommend this crib, it looks amazing!",5

ChooMee Sip'n Soft Top - Red and Purple,"These are great. They make it easier for baby to feed herself because it stays airlocked when she takes her mouth off so the food doesn't fall back to the bottom of the pouch, they prevent baby from squeezing her food all over the place, and she looks happy sucking off a squishy mouthpiece vs being hesitant with the hard plastic pouch tube. Only once it came off when my back was turned but I suspect that I didn't have it secured enough.  But I found the pouch on the floor plenty of times with that mouthpiece still on and not a mess anywhere to be found.  Yay for ChooMee!",5

"The First Years Soothie Newborn Pacifiers, Boy","This is the same kind of pacifier you get in the hospital - and there is a reason for this:  newborns prefer this one.  As a first time parent-to-be I bought, and was given several different types of pacifiers - of course my son's favorite is the one we have only one of:  the one he went home with from the hospital.  I tried to get him to take another one, since I was afraid we'd loose this one (plus it's huge, and covers his cute little face so I wanted him to try the smaller clear one....no way he said!).  It was tough finding these in stores so I resorted to Amazon and bought SEVERAL so we will never be without!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"This toy is really cute and makes great sounds, but my 4 month old has a hard time grabbing most parts of it.  The tail has rings that she can grab, but the hooves are rather large, she tries to grab the feet part instead of the legs.  The antlers that appear to be good to gnaw on are not all that easy for my daughter to get her mouth on, plus I worry about the pointier edges.  Although this is cute, bright, and has lots of different materials, there are better toys.UPDATE:  Now that my daughter is closer to 9 months, she is loving this toy.  She grabs the hooves and swings it around and really enjoys the rings on the tail.",3

Fisher-Price Deluxe Sit-Me-Up Floor Seat,"I rated Fisher Price Deluxe sit me up 4 stars because it is a good seat. I love the jungle Theme and bright colors. The attachments are nice and like that the seat can be easily removed for the washing machine.I didn't rate it 5 stars because of the high price and it doesn't have a table top attachment. It is marketed as deluxe model but it is simply a seat, no real entertainment, just a seat!Overall, cute floor seat.",4

"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I love this play yard. It is so colorful and when I first placed my son in it he loved to look around at the bright colors; then he  liked to play with the butterfly and bug.  He is now 9 months old and giggles &amp; stares at himself in the mirror.  I am so glad he likes it!All of my friends registered and got pack&amp;plays that are narrow and have great features like changing trays etc. I thought I would miss that but I don't. The bottom is cushy and he sleeps in there fine. We all took our kids on vacation and my play yard buttoned up perfectly. It is just as compact and portable. The only difference was that my friend's pack &amp; plays were not as large when set up. This is more like a PLAY PEN.  The pack &amp; plays are narrow. A drawback is that you can NOT put a pack&amp;play sheet on this b/c this play yard is square, while the others are rectangular.  It doesn't matter to me...I put a regular sheet in and tuck it under the whole mat.I really am glad I chose this one. It is colorful, has things to look at and play with, and it is soft and comfortable...this equals great playtime AND sleeptime.",5

Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate,"I bought this gate for the bottom of the stairs so my 15 month old son can't climb up.  We have wide stairs 50"" so this gate is perfect.

"Safety 1st Prism Color Video Baby Monitor, Black","The primary function of this device is to transmit video to a remote monitor and it does a satisfactory job of that.  Its range is 200' at most but I live in New York City where the amount of interference is very high so I'll settle for that.  Everything else about this device is shoddy and its design suggests that very little thought was put into it.  Here's a list of what I think are significant flaws.TRANSMITTER DESIGN:  It's very light for its bulky size.  There should be a clamp and a swan/flexible neck so the camera can be mounted on something like a crib and pointed in any direction you want.  As it is, it has to sit on a flat surface - in my case that's a table or the rail of the crib.  For the latter the unit needs to be balanced ever so perfectly because even the very skinny power cord is enough to pull the unit over on account of it's light weight and smooth underside.RECEIVER DESIGN:  The same problems I just mentioned also apply to the receiver.  It seems very light for its size.  The base is narrower than the rest of the unit and is also smooth, hard plastic.  Keeping it upright and pointed in the right direction is difficult unless you wedge it between other objects.  Again the power cord, flimsy as it is, is enough to spin this thing right around with even the slightest jostle.  A wide set of three legs with rubber stoppers would do wonders for this device.  Also, the buttons are cheap and too small for someone with larger hands.VOLUME:  Most audio devices have a scale from one to ten, this device's scale looks more like this: 0, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10.  Which is to say it's either silent, loud or louder.  Yes, I want it loud when I'm asleep so that it wakes me up but if I'm reading or doing some other quiet activity I don't need every creak or slight noise echoing through my apartment.  Which brings me to my next complaint:AUDIO DELAY:  The reviewer that likened it to poltergeist got it perfectly.  The offset causes everything that's picked up by the transmitter to have it's own echo.  Sometimes a sound can be heard live, then the echo is heard, then the monitor picks up the echo and ""re-echos"" it.  I feel like I'm in the Swiss Alps.BATTERY LIFE:  It's much shorter than I expected.  It seems like they went overboard in cutting manufacturing costs.Anyway, I hope there are better devices out there.  In the meantime this one will to the job, barely.",2

Jeep Car Seat Travel Bag,"For the purpose of traveling with the car seat and checking it, this product was great! Most are on the market for over $50, so we wanted something more affordable. The price is the best out there and the material is solid and durable. We have a Britax Boulevard G4 which is pretty bulky, and it fit with plenty of room to fit other items. I highly recommend this product! If it were to ever get damaged, I feel much better that I only spent $16 as opposed to $50.",5
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,"I doubted that this would be very helpful at first, but being able to mix up such a large amount of formula at once is so nice. We get a lot less foam using this and the consistency of the formula is similar to the pre-mix now. I am very happy with this product. When you are mixing a large amount of formula at once be aware that the water/powder mix is often different from small batches. Check with your brand to find out how much water and formula to use in large batches.",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","This is a GREAT car seat. Well designed, solid and sturdy. BUT - it cannot be used rear-facing.  I am embarrased to admit that I missed this critically important point, despite days of research on many sites. Our little one is not yet two and fairly small-framed. While it's legal for her to face forward, we want to keep her in the safest rear-facing position as long as possible.I'm returning the Nautilus in favor of the MyRide, which can be used rear-facing, but doesn't have the weight range that the Nautilus does. Despite my situation, I'd recommend this seat for any one whose child is old enough to sit facing forward.",5
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","I've owned 6 Britax seats, one was in a fatal accident with my child in the seat, who only suffered a broken leg. I am a huge fan of britax, but this seat is awful.  My child is 50lbs and installing with the seat belt, short or long path is very difficult and hard to get tight.  The big issue is the cover will not stay attached to the seat bottom no matter how many times I reattach it, therefore, when my child climbs in the seat the whole cover gets wadded under her bottom.  This happens every time she gets in or out of the seat, multiple times a day.  It makes it impossible to tighten the harness.  When contacting Britax they know of the problem and basically said it will be a very long time before it is fixed.  Now I am stuck with an expensive seat less than a year old that is a constant problem.  I wish I would have went with the graco nautilus or Radian.",1
Adjustable Reusable Washable One Size Baby Cloth Diaper Diapers Nappy 1 Diaper + 2 Inserts Yellow,This product came in with 3 inserts which is nice but it came in orange instead of yellow.  Not a problem with me since it was cheap.  very soft material.,4
Hallmark 2010 My Second Christmas Ornament,This ornament came fast and just what I was looking for! I feel like it was reasonably priced and in perfect condition as if I bought it from Hallmark!,5
Fisher-Price Sounds 'n Lights Monitor with Dual Receiver,"I am a dad and not good at shopping for these kinds of things, but I hit the target with this one. The range on this thing is AMAZING! I can go 4 houses down (200+ft) and have great reception! It is so clear you can literally hear finger nails tapping on wood. And the price c'mon you cant beat it!",5
Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor with Room Temperature Thermometer,"I don't have a cute new one to use this for. I have an adult MR/DD son that sleep walks. Until I ordered this set I was tied to the bedroom in case he started getting off the bed. Now I have the opportunity to carry the monitor with me to keep an eye on him, and get back to him before problems happen. I find the picture clear enough to know what's happening and the sound does make me aware he's moving around. I am really glad I bought this set!!!",5
The First Years Soothie BPA Free Starter Set,"I have a 3 month old son who used to get very very gassy after each bottle feeding. That is until I bought the First Years Soothie. He is still somewhat gassy but definitely much much better than before. With the old bottles I got, I could see a lot of bubbles forming while my son was drinking his formula. But with this product, I only see a little bit and sometimes none at all. My son didn't have any problem latching onto the nipple even though he is mostly breastfed (he only takes 2 bottles a day) and unlike some other reviews this bottle is not too big for him. I think it's just the right size. We have owned the starter set for a month now and none of the bottles leak.As for the pacifier, my son wouldn't keep it in his mouth too long, just like any other pacifiers. He just doesn't like pacifiers I guess.",5
"Maison Chic Jersey Blankie, Dog",They was a very much needed item.  We left the original Froggy in Georgia at the Grandparents house and our baby had to have his Froggy.  We ordered 2 more for replacements and got them very fast.  Thank you.,5
"Pampers Swaddlers - Size Newborn (up to 10 lbs.), 108 ct.","These are soft, pliable diapers that are easy on my babies skin.  I also like the indicator that turns blue when the diaper is wet.  This size is nice because some other diapers are size 1-2 which is a big jump from the newborn size.  This was a perfect transition.",5
"JL Childress Pack 'N Protect Tote for Glass Bottles and Jars, Black","The bag is nice for holding different size bottles and compact enough to take around with you.  I don't feel it keeps things super cold.  If you are planning on using it more than 2 hours at a time, then this probably is not the bag for you.",3
"Dream On Me Ragtop 2 In 1 Walker and Rocker, Pink",We love this Walker but it does not Go on carpet like its meant to. But that is my only complaint. My Baby Is 7 months which was perfect timing to introduce the walker. I would recommend to anyone with a baby.,4
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","I love this lunch bag, I am so happy I stumbled upon this cute little owl lunchie. I know it's designed for kids in mind but I actually bought it for myself because I thought it was cute and I just had to have it. I've recieved a lot of compliments at work. It's very well made and has lots of room inside.",5
Haba Miniland Fabric Ball,"My almost 7 month old loves this toy. It is small enough for him to hold, but big enough to be able to see and play with all the parts. The whole ball made a tiny twinkling bell sound as it moves. So soothing. Some of the projections (trees, houses) make a crinkle sound. This ball is well made and well loved.",5
"Boon Stem Grass and Lawn Drying Rack Accessory,Yellow",It was ruined by the steam after the first wash and now it is useless. I wish there is warning on the package.,3
"Dolcino Woven Wrap, Kuba, Medium","I love this wrap.  My husband I both use it daily.  I have it in large, red.  I like the extra length although I'm 5'3"" and 135 lbs. and my husband is 5'11"" and 155 lbs.  I can do any style tie and still have long tails (to my knees), which I like the look of.  Also the fabric is thick enough that knots with short tails don't feel as secure to me.  We get tons of complements and curious questions when we use this wrap.  I worried it would be hard to learn, but it wasn't.  YouTube is a great resource.  Used it from my baby's birth.  The Front Wrap Cross Carry was best just at first.  By 8 weeks, the pre-tied Front Cross Carry has been even better - just had to wait for her little newborn legs to stretch out to use that style.  I'd like a second one to use while this one is drying and so that we cam each have one with us.  We don't even need a stroller!",5
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","I love the ease of installing this seat and it looks nice in my car.  It is sturdy and I feel my child is very protected.  A bonus is the side cup holders, so he can put his juice on long trips.A con for this carseat is that it is HEAVY,  I tried to lift it out of the box and could not, it was so heavy my husband had to help me lift it.  Another con is after a 3 hour drive, my son was complaining that his bottom hurt.  After looking at it the seat cover was sliding down and exposing the hard plastic.  I adjusted the cover but had to do this twice in the trip.  This product is great for short trips around the neighborhood but for long drives it is not so comfortable.  Overall,  I would buy this carseat again because overall the safety is the best and my son only complained during a long drive.  However, if you are a long distance traveler or need to move this seat frequently I would not recommend it.",4
"Delta Children's Products Silverton 6 Drawer Chest, Dark Cherry","I put this together with my 5 and 4 year old helping me.  I am 8 months pregnant so it was a bit difficult and I spread it over 2 days but it was worth the time, I really like it and it looks beautiful :)",5
"Carter's Suede Embroidered Tote Bag, Grey","Bag was delivered sooner than expected, which was great!  Its just lovely, and huge! Enough room for all babies things. I'm in love with this diaper bag :)",5
Summer Infant By Your Side Sleeper Portable Bedding,"I received this from a friend and I was not a fan of the mattress or the one sheet. So, I purchased theNaturepedic Organic Cotton Bassinet Oval Mattresswhich measures 14x29. It is about 1 inch shorter than the mattress that the Sleeper comes with, and about 1 inch wider. BUT the mattress it comes with, when pushed up against the head or foot, does already leave about a 1 inch gap, so I don't think that the Naturepedic Mattress is much different. It is thicker and firmer and when pushed up against the head makes a tight fit at the top and much tighter on the sides. Then I rolled up a prefold to wedge at the bottom by the baby's feet. The fit is much tighter and firmer and I think better for every night/day use. However, when traveling I will use the mattress that it came with because otherwise it would not fold up. As for the sheet, I purchased 2 of theKushies Organic Jersey Bassinet Fitted Sheet, Mochawhich fits both the original mattress and the Naturepedic Mattress, even after washing. Baby is not here yet, but I think that this will work well for me.",4
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'n Swing with AC Adapter, My Little Lamb","Loved it.  Grandson watches himself and talks to himself, freeing mom's arms.  She was starting to hold him too much and he was crying when she tried to put him down.  Highly recommend it.",5
"Summer Infant 2 Pack Cotton Knit Swaddleme, Safari (Small/Medium)","It's much easier to use than a regular receiving blanket, and stays in place much better, even with a wiggly baby. The velcro is kind of loud, so it sometimes wakes the baby up when getting her on her wrap, but beyond that, it's been very practical. It's a good idea to make sure the flaps with the velcro are secured so they don't attach to other clothes in the washing machine.",5
Munchkin Five Multi Cups,"I love these cups.  I love colorful cups.  When we have little guests, I can tell whose cup is whose.  (It does have 2 orange cups, though!)  I love small cups for little ones so they don't fill up large cups.  Large cups and little people means more waste and more spills.  I wish they had more colors!",5
Safety 1st Sliding Door Lock,"We bought this lock so that our toddler couldn't open the sliding door and go outside - it looked convenient enough so that we'd still be able to open it to let the dog in and out.  Before even installing it, I wondered if the door would even still be able to close fully if it was installed.  I put it where it would be when installed, and confirmed that the door would not be able to fully close and lock with the item in place, since it would be between the door and the frame.  Unfortunately, the way it was designed also made it so that it could not be installed on the other side of the door so that it wouldn't get sandwiched.  I went to the manufacturer's web site, and cannot even find the item listed on their page, even using the item number on the  box.  I will be returning this product, and would not advise anyone who needs their door to fully close and lock to purchase it.As I side note, it also did not include the spacer template that it referenced in the instructions, and in the picture on Amazon.  I'm not sure if perhaps someone else had already returned this item for the same reasons and forgot to put it back in, or if it just wasn't included in the first place.",2
Combi Flare Lightweight Stroller in Mandarin,"I got this stroller because I needed something lightweight. And yes, it is lightweight and it's easy to fold and to open. But that's about it.  We live in Miami and the umbrella is completely useless, it barely covers the sun and it certainly does not cover rain. The steering is really awful, you cannot do it with one hand if there's barely a bump on the ground. The tires are pretty cheap and don't handle much.  Overall it's an ok stroller, but it feels a bit on the cheap side, which I suppose is why it's so light weight.",3
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Lion Activity Block,"Well, maybe it's because my baby was around 7 months old when I bought this for her, but she really is not interested in it at all.I thought it would make a great toy because of the different sides, crinkly noise, and mirror....but nope. It's just not that appealing to her. I still am keeping it for future kiddies, but you can find other more interesting toys out there.",3
Tortle Repositioning Beanie - FDA cleared to Prevent and Treat Flat Head Syndrome - Whimisical Blue Elephant - MD,A brilliant and simple solution to solving Flathead Syndrome.  It is important to purchase the right size and wear it properly so that baby can't wiggle out of it. I would recommend this to all parents as a must have.  What an easy way to prevent a serious problem. They wash well too.,5
Bumble Bags Jessica Messenger Backpack Rosey Stripe,"i bought this bag and loved the fact that you can wear it as a back pack as i live on a 4th floor walk up and it is a great asset when you have to carry stroller, baby, shopping and diaper bag up stairs!  however, unless you pack the bag very lightly, it pops open and everything just tumbles out.  this has happened so many times, not just when i wear it as a back pack.  but it is pretty and i do still use it when i don't need too much in it.",3
Philips AVENT Express Food and Bottle Warmer,I have had this warmer since my first child was born almost 6 years ago.  I will soon be using it for my 4th child - and it still works like a charm.  I don't even empty it out every time I use it.  I just dump out the water and put fresh water in every few days  or so.  I have used it for baby food and bottles alike.My single and only complaint is no timer.  I have overheated bottles not infrequently as I get busy making dinner or something.  It does heat quickly - just about 4 minutes on high for a full 8 oz bottle.,5
Samsung Wireless Video Security Monitoring System,"I went back and forth between this monitor and the Motorola with the 3.5 inch screen. I chose this monitor because it was less expensive than the Motorola. After just over a week I returned the monitor and ended up purchasing the Motorola. There were many things about this monitor that I found to be quite disappointing. On the parent unit the beeping sound when you use a button cannot be turned off, so in the middle of the night if you go to change something it beeps loudly. The sensitivity of the camera was ridiculous; even on the lowest sensitivity setting the camera would pick up sounds from our downstairs (the camera was in the baby's room upstairs). Because the camera was so sensitive, even the tiniest noise came through the parent unit very loudly. After a few days the night vision video on the parent unit became blury and unclear. Also, every time you turn off the parent unit the clock and date resets and you have to change it every time you turn it back on. I did like the night light feature that this monitor has, and we also did not have any problems with interference. However, the sensitivity issue was just too much for us and we opted to purchase the Motorola instead.",1
Westminster Hand Boilers (Colors May Vary),"I bought this for my daughter who is 10. I realize it said for age 14 and up but my daughter is quite careful. Anyway, there is no way I can give it to her. It was adverstised as an interesting science type toy. It came to me in a box that says love thermometer all over it and for adult use only. Yes, it was not expensive but now I guess I throw it away.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My little one is six months now and LOVES his bathtime. He giggles and splashes and feels very safe and comfortable in his little tub. I never used the sling in the sink. We went right into the little tub with the sling at first. We have never had any problems. I put his little tub in the normal, big tub and that works great. That way I can climb in the big tub, stay dry and be right by his side. I would definately recommend it to others.",5
"Motorola Blink1 Wi-Fi Video Camera for Remote Viewing with iPhone and Android Smartphones and Tablets, Red","Works great! Had a few minor connection problems but then I called their support center and we fixed them, great for the house we put it in our sons bedroom and Pointed it at his crib, I can now do things around the house and even go outside and not have to worry about the monitor going fuzzy or being too far, we actually had our sons godfather view the camera in Florida from his phone and we live in ct, along with 3 other people at the same time... video quality overall isn't the greatest but if anyone has ever seen a video baby monitor I think they would agree it is just as clear as any other monitor, plus the extra features of snap shot, lullabies zoom and night vision are a great to have!",4
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I ordered one of these bras in pink to try and am coming back to buy a few more. I absolutely love the freedom it gives me while I pump and it is super comfy to wear throughout the day. The straps are an added bonus allowing you to wear it multiple ways. I have a 2 year old and a newborn and having my hands available while I pump has been very helpful. I also looked at a few other brands, like Medela's hands-free bra and found that this one provides more coverage for all day wear.",5
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"These bibs were the sturdiest I have found so far.  They caught a lot of food.. and when my son got sick, they caught the other stuff too.  They kept him from making huge messes all over the place.",5
"American Baby Company Organic Cotton Interlock Crib Sheet, Natural",I bought two of these sheets. They are super soft and fit the crib mattress very well. I received an organic fitted sheet from Pottery Barn that is not even half as soft as these sheets are. Love these.,5
The Art of Cure TM - Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace - Large Bean Rainbow Amber Beads - w/ &quot;The Art of Cure TM&quot; jewelry storage pouch,"I was skeptical, but I figured worst case scenario he would look adorable. On that point, I was definitely correct. But also, within 15 minutes of putting it on my 4 month old, his massive droolface was gone. I usually put it on his leg at night, but recently I have just taken it off altogether because he will wake up and play, usually with his feet. Very pleased. I ordered another for a friends baby and she adores hers as well. Will be ordering more.",5
"Bummis Bio-Soft Liner, Small",These are great. Once our baby transitioned to solids we quickly learned these were the way to go. We have a diaper sprayer but seldom use it since this is much cleaner. A must have for any cloth diapering parent,5
"Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory","I received this pillow as a gift when I was about 5 months pregnant and my hips were KILLING me every night... After a night or two sleeping with this beauty my lower back and hips felt SO much better. It was amazing. Now that I'm almost 8 months along, I still have some pain when I wake up, but nothing compared to what it would be without this pillow. Highly recommended!One of my favorite things about it is the ability to fold it in half and make a lounger out of it. So convenient! Also, I was a little wary of wrangling the thing out of its pillowcase to wash it and then wrangling it back in, but it wasn't actually as difficult as I thought it would be.",5
Boob-ease Organic Cotton + Bamboo Fleece + Flax Seeds Soothing Therapy Pillows,"My Fiance Loves these! They work great for her. She has not tried to microwave them yet but they work great for being placed in the freezer  and used for cooling later.  Great experience with the company, They were delivered on time.",5
Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor with Temperature Sensor and Night Mode,"No doubt about this, this baby monitor is awesome.  Very easy to use right out of the box with simple instructions. The unit is aesthetically pleasing with sleek and modern designs.  The transmission works flawlessly and the sound is crystal clear.  The unit has lots of neat features like temperature readings and a cool and soothing night light.The quality of the unit seems great and it will probably last as long as needed.  Highly recommend this item.",5
Ken Health - Mini Medicator - Baby Medicine Dispenser/Pacifier with Free Syringe,"I bought this because of its great reviews and was not disappointed.  It's easy to use and beats several little squirts of medicine that inevitably come out of her mouth.  It can bee kind of hard to close, but once you figure it out, it's not so bad.  Medicine can come out a little fast...  Haven't tried with the syringe yet...  My baby is 12 weeks old.",5
"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","I was hoping for more room with this but it does the trick. Also, not too happy about the plastic straps as this was a $90 bag. We'll see how it all holds up.",4
Jeep Tandem Traveler Stroller,"my child and i both love it and it is sooo easy to put together and fold out and in, makes this mommy of two smile =)",5
"Animal Planet Neck Support, Lion","My son is glad to have this item in his stuffed animal collection (which seems to be getting bigger by the day!)  It is soft, has held up well and hasn't caused any allergy issues.  As a traveling pillow though, he wouldn't leave it in place for very long.",4
"Lamaze Cloth Book, Panda's Pals",The book itself is bright and colorful. It makes the sound of being crumpled when touched and has a fuzzy owl on the front.,4
"Philips Avent BPA Free Classic Bottle to First Cup Trainer, 4+ Months, Clear",The size and the handles are perfect for a 6-7 month old to hold. But the soft spout does not last for too long. I had 2 of these and the spouts tore quite rapidly within a month's use.,3
"Tommee Tippee 2-in-1 Bottle and Nipple Cleaner, Colors may vary",This bottle brush works great--other brushes have bristles that are just too hard to clean the bottles very well. Be on the look out for sale prices.,5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"After reading about all of the baby monitors, this one seemed like the best choice.  I am very pleased with it.  There is one place in the house that, if you stand there, the monitor will make an interference noise.  But, besides that they work fine.  Luckily I haven't had to change the channels, because the one we set it on first was fine.  And the clartity is amazing!  I wouldn't trade them for any others.",4
"Binkibear The Original Pacifier, Classic Brown","we got this about 6 months ago after talking with friends who use the wubbanub.  my toddler loves the Nuk pacifiers.  She would lose her pacifier during the night and it would fall on the floor and of course she would be mad.  as she got older and could control things more on her own, we thought this would be a great idea.  we call him &#34;Paci Bear&#34;.  He stays in my little ones crib.  If she loses her paci in the night, paci bear saves her, and us from getting woken up.",5

"aden + anais 3 Pack Muslin Snap Bib, Jungle Jam","I love anything A&A. These are really cute but it depends on what you are using it for that will make them either annoying or useful for you. For food, they seem great, I don't use them for food though. My daughter drools through everything within 20 minutes so these bibs are good of that due to multiple layers. The burpy bibs are way better for the drool because they are super thick but when my daughter started to crawl and get real active they got in the way of her hands to play. These do the same. I purchased the cheaper version prior and didn't realize there was a difference in size. Cheaper ones are way better for crawlers and the snap is in the back not showing. They seem a little thinner and not as soft( but they are bibs not blankets who cares) but still way better and cuter than regular bibs. Love the pattern as I have it in the swaddles.",4
Cloud b Sleep Sheep On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds,"The sleep sheep travel is a better younger brotherI would choose this model over anotherThis one has great sounds that babies likeSo this is one to get, not &#34;maybe&#34; or &#34;I might&#34;Very simple to use, volume control turns on the device, then you have 4 sounds to choose from.  There are 4 different sounds to choose from and the sound selection are better (in my opinion) than those of the larger version of this toy.  The white noise has been instrumental in helping my baby sleep when they're going crazy or are tired.  Very useful and is a great product!",5

"Iwako Japanese Puzzle Eraser New 2013 Cruise Ship, Airplane &amp; Helicopter 7pcs Color May Vary","My daughter collects erasers. This is a great addition to her eraser collection, or for any child just starting their collection, or to give as a gift to a child that you know they will enjoy & use.",5
"Leachco Podster Sling-Style Infant Seat Lounger, Sage Pin Dot","I wish I would have had this for my first child. Just got this for my second child who was spitting up a lot, grunting, and gassy. This has helped a lot since it keeps her elevated when she naps/ sleeps. It has reduced her spitting up tremendously. This lounger will work for you if you don't want to lay your baby down flat all the time. I didn't want to constantly use the swing so this is working great for us. I highly recommend it.",5
"Safety 1st Air Protect On Board 35 Infant Car Seat, Ella",Other then the fact that I feel like the print is &#34;grandma fabric&#34; (my hubby insisted the carseat be pink) it overall a great buy!!! My daughter will be 1 next week and we are still using it! It is a larger then other seats but it seems to be a safe one! My 2 year old is in a safety 1st air ride convertible and loves it! That's the main reason we went with this one when we had our daughter! We plan on upgrading her to a air ride convertable soon!,4
"Soft Gear My Booster Seat, Mint",Just a plain old booster seat. Does as expected.,3
"The First Years True Choice A100 Digital Monitor, One Parent Unit","I remember when baby monitors first came out...when some of my oldest younger siblings were little.You could 'receive' sound on a radio if you fidgeted with the tuner just right.This monitor really isn't all that bad for a sound monitor and is probably more secure than some of its predecessors.I don't use it as my primary monitor, but rather when we travel.I find it does a decent job of subduing background noise in favor of baby noise, but if the volume is turned way up you hear a fair bit of white noise.The only time my unit beeped was when I turned the power off to the baby's unit. That's totally acceptable, IMHO.I think in this day and age it really ought to come with a rechargeable battery pack OR be about $10 less expensive.If you are really concerned with keeping tabs on your young baby (under 6 mos) then maybe consider a video monitor.Otherwise this does as it should: let's you know when baby is awake when baby wants you to know s/ he is awake.",3
"Swaddledesigns Marquisette Swaddling Blanket Pastel Mod Circle, Kiwi","I already had two of the flannel versions of these, and wanted two lighter weight ones because I live in sunny Florida. I also love that these are made in America, I try very hard not to buy things made in China because you just do not know what you are really getting. The weight of these are perfect, if it's a bit cooler I layer another blanket on inside  of this before swaddling the baby in it. My little one loves to be swaddled. These are quite a bit bigger than the flannel version, but works in just the same manner. It's kind of a muslin/linen feeling to it, and it washes and dries perfectly. The swaddler is also a great cover up for when you are breast feeding in public, keeps you covered without over heating the baby. I bought two of these and would buy them again and again.ADDED A FEW WEEKS LATER: I assumed incorrectly that these are made in the USA like the flannel ones. They ARE NOT. They are made in China which greatly disappointed me. I took a star away for that reason. I really wish Amazon would start listing what country things are made in.",4
"Orbelle 3-6T Toddler Bed, Natural",Our granddaughter is two and we bought this bed for when she visits. The finish is a rich and beautiful cherry that matches the furniture in the room perfectly. It doesn't take up a lot of space and she absolutely loves it. I think the price is great for the quality of the bed. It was a breeze to assemble and stores nicely in the attic when not in use.,5
"Graco Glider Petite LX Gliding Swing, Forecaster","We went through three of these in less than a month. Each time the exact same feature broke and amazon replaced the item. We bought this cause it was a glider and had music, but it will break and the music will stop working. What happens is the mechanism inside the swing arm motor housing breaks off the wire housing that works the audio. Not only does this remove the music feature, but now the glider will make a plastic clicking noise with every swing as it brushes up against the broken plastic inside.Until Graco realizes this, I would steer clear or go for the model up. Really is a shame this product was built so poorly.",1
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","Great lunch bag!  this bag is insulated and pretty strong. it holds enough for a school child up to primary school, Its a stand up bag to avoid leaking and spills. Would recommend this to anyone . My two year old thinks the design is great. Its attractive and sturdy!",5
InSTEP Pathfinder - Bicycle Trailer,"a tag along,I think that this is a wonderful product.Especially when adults want to go on a bike ride and not have to wait for their kids, because they fall behind.With this they can just ride freely.also, it is a wonderful product because the parent doesn't have to do a lot of work pulling the kid,because the kid has to pedal also.It also can be stred easily with other bikes, and removed from a bike very eaisly. Thanks for looking :)(:",4

Maxim Toys Noah's ARK Ever Earth Eco Friendly Wooden Preschool Toy,"My son is 11 months old and enjoys playing with this toy (under close supervision, of course).  He examines each piece and likes to put the animals in and out of the ark through the open section on top (the roof and little ""house"" components come apart, i.e. the roof in two panels and the house in one piece).Pros:- Eco friendly (wood / nontoxic paint)- Affordable price- Good size- Good for a variety of agesCons:- Pieces are only painted on one side- Shapes are a bit ambiguous to use as a ""sorting"" toy, in addition to the fact the the base is angled and unless you pick up the ark, it is awkward to push the corresponding animal through its respective opening",4
Hospital's Choice Nasal Aspirator,"I assumed this was the green syringe bulb you receive in the hospital when your baby is born except white, especially because it's the same brand but it's tiny and not that great of suction. I ended up throwing it away because it wasn't worth the cost to return it :(",1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",My 3-month-old immediately took to this toy and started batting the toys.  Love that we will be able to use it for a long time.,5
"KF Baby LUJO Diaper Bag, Navy Blue, with kilofly Refrigerator Magnet",The bag is pretty big and has 2 bottle-holding interior pockets along with 2 large diaper and babywipes pockets. Also it has 3 mid size pockets for optional use. I like the beautiful navy color and the waterproof fabric! And these 2 stroller hooks were just smart design!! Such a lovely diaper bag with this price is a good bargain!!!,5

Summer Infant Complete Coverage Color Video Monitor Set with 7&quot; LCD Screen and 1.8&quot; Handheld Unit,"In just over 2 years, we have gone through two of these video monitors.  The screen failed just over a year so we had to buy a second one from Summer Infant.  After having the second monitor for LESS THAN 1 year, the screen/video has already failed.  We will NOT be buying anything else from this company, as they do not stand behind their product.  We actually purchased a smaller screen baby video monitor by Motorola.  It was fairly pricey in the mid $200's but it's been a great monitor thus far.  Again, I highly recommend NOT buying this monitor.",1

Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Moka,"THIS IS A WONDERFULL STROLLER ,IS  VERY LIGTH WEIGHT AND EASY TO FOLD JUST ONE HAND.I LIKE IT VERY MUCH!!",5
Quinny Buzz Stroller-Juice,"I got this stroller because I wanted a full-size stroller that I could actually fit into the trunk of my Mazda RX-8. I was originally shopping for a Bugaboo Bee, but ran across a Buzz and fell in love.Pros: Fantastic ride, adjustable handle bar, great looks, comfortable for children, folds up smaller than most strollers of the same size.The telescoping handle is great for me and my husband since we can adjust it to fit whoever is currently pushing the stroller.It pushes and turns like a dream. The rear tires give it a great ride, and it is very easy to get up over curbs- just tip up the front end and walk it up and over.In spite of what some reviews are saying, it folds up very compactly for a full size stroller. It's one of the only non-umbrella strollers I can get into the trunk of my RX-8 (seat or Dreami cot- they both fit in with the frame, especially when the frame/stroller is flipped upside down first). Also, for a full size stroller, it's average weight, so again, I'm not sure what the fuss is about it being so heavy. But if my 5 ft self has no problem lifting it into my car and my husband's SUV, I can't imagine anyone else would have much trouble either. Compared to the Graco Quattro we've got, it's tiny! I think the people complaining have had very little experience with normal full sized strollers, else they'd realize how small and not-heavy the Buzz actually is.The fabric also cleans up well, having been given some kind of scotch guard treatment at the factory, and we've gotten a TON of use out of the bug net (Virginia in the late summer/fall is mosquito heaven). The sun canopy and rain guard will be put to good use too when we visit Disney in a few months.We went ahead and bought the Dreami cot as well, and honestly, it was a great buy for us. Since our youngest was born in September (and the stroller was purchased for her) we've taken her out everywhere in it. And, it doubles as a bassinet when we stay overnight with the inlaws. She'll be ready for the actual seat in a couple months, and I'm anticipating arguments over who gets to ride in it with my 4 yr old, who claimed it as hers before the baby arrived. We did not get a Maxi Cosi car seat, as we already had a Graco Snugride that we liked. Turns out this was a good thing anyway, as the baby HATES being in her car seat, but loves sleeping in the Dreami Cot bassinet.I've never gotten so many compliments on a stroller before in my life- someone is always stopping to ask us about it.Cons: I couldn't give it 5 stars, though I would have liked to give it 4.5.Folding it up can sometimes be a pain- it's just a little tough to get everything pushed just right (it unfolds more easily than anything you've ever seen before, though). With that said, I've never had so much trouble that I thought it diminished the value of the stroller. Would be really nice to have a one-handed fold-up though, and this is definitely not even close.I wish there was more storage space. The little storage bag that hangs underneath the stroller doesn't hold much at all. Also, it has no cup holders for parents. We solved that problem by buying one with a universal stroller attachment, but it would be nice to have one that came with it, for the price of the stroller. We'll also be buying some kind of storage bag to hang off it.The wheelbase is perhaps a touch wider than I'd like. I've never found an aisle/store/sidewalk it didn't fit on, but it is definitely wider than some other strollers. I don't believe it's much, if any, wider than the Graco Quattro, however.The storage bag is separate, and costs $169. I'd really like one for the plane ride to Disney, so the stroller doesn't get scuffed, but the price is so steep I may just find something else to wrap it in.Overall, a great stroller, and I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone.",4
"Evenflo Triumph 65 LX Seat, Cocoa Fizz","We love this car seat!A month after we bought a new car seat for my wife's car, we picked up this one for mine. This car seat is easily our favorite. It cost less, is easier to adjust, and is more comfortable for our child.My wife's TrueFit cost $100 more and does not work nearly as well.",5

"Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Walker, Ocean Explorer","It works great and my baby loves it, and I know this is actually my fault, but because I have carpet in my house my baby can't really love in it. Also I can't even push it forward because the tires get stucks. It's rolls backwards great. My carpet is not very high and my friends has one that will roll on the carpet but hers cost 150$!!!! No way... So it works great for it's cost and when I bring her in the kitchen she takes of going. I would give 5 stars if I didn't have carpet.",4

Maya Wrap Lightly Padded Ring Sling - Burnt Orange - Medium,"The Maya wrap is comfortable and easy to use. I have other baby carrying wraps and the Maya wrap is by far the most comfortable to use for long periods and very practical to use for carrying my l.o. around the house, out for long walks and breastfeeding. The Maya wrap was a life saver when my daughter was very colicy; she would be calm and sleep when snuggled in the Maya wrap. I highly recommend this baby wrap.",5
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",The projection is wonderful! I love being able to switch out the disks for a different picture. Gave it three stars because the sound quality is pretty bad when we play anything other than the &#34;rain&#34; setting.,3
"Evenflo Active Soft Carrier, Lemon Grass","I purchased this carrier about 5 months ago and have only used it a few times. I feel like my baby is squished in it because it is so narrow. The waistband is comfortable but it rides up if it's not low enough. If I carry my baby higher up, so I can kiss his little head, it kills my back (advice not to carry too high). Other than it being ok, it's not a bad buy if you want to just walk around for an hour while shopping or while doing some housework but if you were to use this more than a few months,hours at a time, good luck. I can't imagine my baby fitting in this over 9 months old. I give it a 3.",3
"Thirsties Duo Wrap, Honeydew, Size Two (18-40 lbs)","I have been a long time fan of thirsties. I have the old fitted diapers with snaps. I have had those diapers for 6 years and they work better now then the day I bought them. I have every size of unbleached prefolds that your company made and love them so much I could never buy any others. I have never had anything but great things to say about your company and your products.But I have to say that the new thirsties duo wrap is a travesty in product quality. I have been cloth diapering for 10 years now. I have some wraps that I have been able to use for 8 years because I know exactly how to wash/dry wraps in order to have them last a long time. The duo wrap is shoddily made. It is obviously thrown together in the fastest way possible. The DESIGN is wonderful, the execution is horrible. The unfinished pocket in the front would be fine if it was done like bumkins- with some care, not just a raw piece of fabric. The lamination is horrible. I have had 8  wraps that I have used and treated well for just two weeks and they all smell horrible and leak because the fabric is barely water resistant, let alone capable of keeping in leaks. Thirsties has sacrificed quality, even if the design is wonderful, it is useless to have a great design when you execute the design in the cheapest and fastest way possible and sacrifice the quality of the end result. I feel cheated. I spent over $100 on your products and now that money is essentially flushed down the drain since I will now have to buy wraps to replace the ones I bought from you that have failed me.",1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I went ahead and bought this sleeper and I am so glad I did!  After my c-section I had trouble climbing into the bed so I put the sleeper next to the couch.  Later on, we were able to easily move it to the bedroom.  My son loved to be rocked in it and the angle enabled him to see me when I put him down into it.It's lightweight and portable, so it was perfect when the in-laws came to visit and decided to stay in a hotel almost 2 hours away or when I took my son to the babysitter's house while we were having work done at our house.  I think this would be wonderful for grandparents/other people the baby frequently visits to have handy at their house as well because it folds and can be put away.  It easily fit into the trunk of my car.The yellow one comes with a little rabbit with a square of fabric attached and it rattles a little.  My son (now 8 months) loves this little toy and it's the perfect size for him to hold.I did read the warnings about the babies developing flat heads or their heads tilting to one side so I bought a Snuzzler to go with the sleeper.  Problem solved.  When our son was a newborn, we put the entire Snuzzler in with him and we were still able to buckle him in.  When he got older, we just used the part that went under his head.  It helped keep him snug and on his back.Overall this is a wonderful item, especially for those with limited space available, babies with reflux (a problem we thankfully didn't have), or for overnight stays with the baby.  It's affordable too, so I would also give this at a baby shower.",5
Amber Heals Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace-Baroque Lemon w/ &quot;Amber Heals&quot; Jewelry Pouch,"It seems to work for my daughter. My doctor told me she had seen too many babies choke in a car seat with necklaces because their parents thought they were sleeping and asked me not to leave on while in carseat. I agree. You can't keep constant watch from the front seat, so we take hers off before bed and if she's in the car seat. But when she doesn't have it on around the house, she does seem a bit ill. I will continue to use this on her.",4

"timi &amp; leslie Marie Antoinette 7-Piece Diaper Bag Set, Black","I have not used this bag yet because I am still pregnant, but I can say that it is beautiful. I wanted a bag that I could carry in place of a purse and still look nice, and this one fits the bill perfectly. The fabric is pretty, the straps are a great touch and the color (I went with amethyst) is striking. I will come back and update my review to address functionality once I have used it for a while, but based on looks alone it is more than worth the price.",5
Nuby 5 Count Splish Splash Stacking Bath Cups,Kids love these; stay in tub forever because they are playing so long.  Tub toys are the way to go!!,5
"HALO SleepSack Comfort Mesh Early Walker Wearable Blanket, Blue Dog, Large",I have used Halo SleepSacks since my son was 4 months old and was somewhat skeptical of the mesh Early Walker BUT now I am very glad that I bought 2 for my 12 month old.  The mesh is great for summer (for toddlers) when all that is needed is a sheet (for adults).  The foot openings give my son mobility which is great for standing up and toddling around.  I would recommend this product to anyone!,5

DEX Products Grab N Go Bottle Warmer BWC-01,"I bought this to warm up refrigerated breastmilk when traveling.  I only tried it once as it did not work very well in warming cold milk.  When you press the button, you can feel the item warming up, but it never got really hot.  After 15 minutes of warming, the bottle of milk was only lukewarm.  Not very good if your baby prefers warmer milk.  I did try the unit out before traveling, and it did work well warming up room temp water for formula milk.  I had better success in warming up cold milk with carrying around a thermos of piping hot water and an empty plastic container to sit the bottle of milk in it and then pouring the hot water into the container when needed.",2
"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso","We bought this crib and LOVE it! It went together so easily and the style is perfect.

Finding organic plush toys aren't always easy, and when you do they often look very &#34;earthy&#34; if you know what I mean.

Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"This saved our sanity.  We live in a small house, and we needed a place to put our kid when we cooked, cleaned and went to the bathroom.  This was perfect.  I have not had any quality issues.  I do think this is superior to other play yards in that there are 8 sections instead of 6.  This allows many more configurations.  We have ours in a hexagon, configured like a half octagon.  To keep it from sliding around, we ordered rubber floor mats and zip-tied the frame to the mat.  SeeB003TU3ZZU",5

"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","When my son was a newborn, I was able to fold it in two and placed a blanket on top to make it a little more comfortable because it is kind of scratchy.  Now at four months it is at is full length and I still put a blanket on top of it.  Whenever he gets it wet I just take the blanket and the cover and wash it easily.  I don't have to mess with the fitted sheet and trying to get it off of the mattress which is so hard since they are so tightly fitted against the crib.  This makes life simple and cleaner.  You can use it anywhere.",4
"Caden Lane Boutique Collection Bedding Boutique Full Duvet, Girl",Our 4 year old loves this vibrant duvet! It's very girly...goes great with the rest of her hot pink rose room. Washes well and it's very soft. We stuffed it with a down alternative blanket and it looks great. Worth the money!,5

I'm currently using with a Safety 1st Air Protect in a Subaru Impreza and it covers everywhere the carseat touches.  With my car seat facing forward it is hard to access the storage pocket but since I have over the seat storage not a big deal.  Just bought another for my second vehicle!,5
"Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, Red","First purchased a cheaper clip on chair from Walmart but immediately returned it as it was flimsy and the material was very cheap.  This clip on booster is a nice canvas material that wipes clean very easily and can also be taken off the frame completely and thrown in the washer/dryer.  I have actually just put it in a sink full of warm soapy water several times and then either hung outside to dry or put in the dryer for a quick run.  It dries super quick!!It clips securely to most tables as long as there is no obstructions (such as butterfly style table extensions) and despite other reviews, it does get right up close to the edge of the table.  Food can fall before it makes it to your babies mouth of course, but I cutdown on that by adding a table mat with tray (Tiny Diner Placemat) and bib with pouch (Tommee Tippee Explora Easy Roll Bib).  When my baby was smaller and just starting to eat solids I had to put a small pillow or rolled towel behind her to position her a little more close to the table, not a problem and actually good that it will allow for growth and use for quite a while as she contnues to grow.  I actually don't have a problem with the steaps and sometimes don't even use them, my child does not try to climb out.  Although, I don't put her in the chair unless it's time to eat and we are sitting together anyways.  Children should not be left unattended anyways.I have used this chair at restaurants and as long as it's a sturdy table, it's not a problem.  It folds easily and travels nicely.It is nice to have your child sitting at the table as part of the family and not off to the side like an appendage and takes up no extra room in the eating area.  Just like a chair at the table and promotes family eating together.Would definitely recommend and can't beat the price.  Have never used another ""highchair"" for my daughter and glad I didn't get a big bulky regular high chair or on the seat booster.",5
Sassy Crib and Floor Mirror,"My baby loves this mirror!  I put it in front of him during Tummy Time and he stares at the bee and ladybug.  I roll the ladybug body and he stares at that too. It is great that it is adjustable and can stand on it's own.  This makes it easy to use rather than having to hold it up or lean it against something.I just with the bee and ladybug were detachable.  I tried to pull them off, but did not want to break it.",4

"phil&amp;teds Portable Traveller Crib, Black","I was really hoping for a playpen that was light and fast to assemble that I could possibly take to a park or beach.  This definitely did not fit what I was picturing in my mind.  I couldn't even put it together, had to get my husband to do it and even he struggled and ended up needing tools to push the black button thing down.Although it is lighter, it is definitely not smaller when folded down than the other playpen I had.  There was seriously no benefit.The only kind of person that might really appreciate something like this is someone who travels by plane a lot and needs something very light weight to keep down costs.  Otherwise, it was no better than a regular playpen, just really overpriced.",1

Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"We got this for our baby as a baby shower gift.  It registered accurately only twice.  Since the second usage, it registers drastically different temperatures within seconds of each reading.  Covers are also impossible to find.  Plus, I was told that I would have to wait until baby was 6 months for an ear thermometer to work properly.  She's 7 months and no change!This is a complete waste of money.  Please don't bother.  Your best guess is more accurate for your baby's temperature.  We bought a basic digital for less than half price and use arm pit temperature now.  Much closer to reality!",1
Baby Einstein Sea Dreams Soother,"This has been helpful for getting our daughter to fall asleep on her own. It was very easy to install on the crib. Some things I would change if I could would be...1. The timer- it goes for 45 minutes or so but it would be nice to do 20 minutes or something shorter 2. Once it goes off the unit is still technically on & I believe it drains the battery, since my daughter doesn't sleep through the night I can turn the unit off in the middle of the night. We have had it 4 weeks & already replaced batteries but it could be the demo batteries don't last as long. 3. The remote doesn't work that great. We don't use it at all. The things we like about it are the 2 volume settings, nice sounds, night light, easy to install & our baby likes it. I would but it again...wish it was pink to match baby's room :)",4

Summer Infant Complete Coverage Color Video Monitor Set with 7&quot; LCD Screen and 1.8&quot; Handheld Unit,"The handheld only lasted about 6 months. When I called customer service, they told me to ship it back and that they would ship me back a new one within 7-10 business days. . . well, that means that I would be without my expensive monitor for 2-3 weeks (including shipping time there and back). So, I had to go out and buy a cheap monitor so that I could still hear my infant while the expensive monitor was in transit. When I finally got the replacement, the nightvision stopped working within 2 weeks . . . guess what . . . now I have to send it in AGAIN - at my own expense. Nice. Guess I better get my other monitor out again.Additionally, even when the system is working, it seems to be bothered by all kinds of other radio interference that's around it in the house. It's a little tempermental.This is an expensive system that is only okay - and the customer service is not the greatest.",2
"Carter's 3 Count Keep Me Dry Flannel Lap Pads, Girl Circle","I use these instead of a changing pad when I'm at home and just need to do a quick change on the floor. They are not waterproof, but if you pick them up fast enough nothing will leak through. I also use them on my changing pad so I don't have to wash the entire thing every time there's an accident. I own 6 of these and they're all in heavy use. This was a great buy.",5

Munchkin Auto Seat Protector,"I needed something for our new car to protect from the wear and tear of our carseat and child climbing on the seat.

Inflatable Bathtub Alphabet Inflatable Bathtub Liner,"I wasn't sure of this product when I bought, but it is definitely worth the money and has saved my ten month old son from several bumps and bruises (he gets a little rowdy in the tub). The only reason I gave it four stars is because it needs to be cleaned frequently. My son loves playing in the water, so he takes two baths a day and because the liner stays wet almost constantly it needs to be cleaned about once a week. If it isn't, it will grow mold and at that point it is really difficult to clean. Oh, and our tub is slanted in the back and I had no problems with the suction cups sticking to it ( I think one reviewer did).",4

The toxicity of today's mattresses are appalling and Moonlight Slumber has addressed this problem by creating natural mattresses.  Their customer service is amazing and I would defininetly recommend this mattress.,5
"Evenflo Modern 300 High Chair, Trivet Blue","If you have more than one child you do not have the time to clean a difficult-to-clean highchair. Been there and done that it was misery when I only had one child. With more than one child now I need a chair that is:1. Easy to keep clean (easy means wipes off quickly and there are no cracks, crevices, holes for food and drink to get into and mold away)2. Sturdy and strong3. Attractive4. Easy to assemble from the boxThis highchair meets all of those requirements and I highly recommend it.",5
Superman &amp; Shield Comic Little Boy Blue Soft Baby Blanket for Boy TM &amp; DC Comics,"As expected. Soft kids blanket, not a bad purchase. Bought this as a birthday kid for a Superman theme Bday party, hopefully he likes it",3
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"We absolutely LOVE the Snap 'N Go and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a stroller.  It's very easy to use and extremely light.  I love it b/c I can use it when we go for walks or run errands.  It's not a hassle to carry around and it fits in a small trunk very easily.  The infant seat literally ""snaps"" right in and is very secure.  I do, however, think that it works best with the Baby Trend infant carrier and not well with others.  We have friends who originally purchased the Graco Snugride to use with the Snap N Go, but it just didn't seem secure at all . . . very wobbly.  They ended up switching car seats and are much happier.I can understand people wanting a stroller that grows with your child, but the travel systems are so cumbersome and this is SO easy to use.  We have a lightweight stroller to use when we want to use something other than the Snap N Go and it works just fine.This is, by far, the best item that we registered for.",5
Hugga-Bebe Infant Support Cushion (Yellow),"I received this as a gift and I can't believe how much I love it.  We use it when going out to eat to hold the baby up in high chairs, We us it in his Johnny Jumper, exersaucers etc.  Some people complain that they can't reach the toys, and I can see that but it hasn't been a big deal for me.  Its also great for playground swings.  The only issue I have is that my son gets so caught up playing he spits up and then I have to clean it and its not an easy fabrick to clean.  It's like it needs a slip cover or something.  Other than that...its wonderful!",4
"Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Toddler Size 2 - Pack of 2 (Mint Green, White)","These came up when I searched for toddler Snappis.  It was not clear to me in the product description that these were actually Size 1 instead of Size 2, or I never would have ordered them.  Otherwise, Snappis are awesome!",1
Boba 2G Baby Carrier - Chestnut,"I cannot emphasize enough just how plush the panel and straps feel on this baby carrier.  Sure, the style is quite modern and sleek, but what does that amount to if it isn't comfortable, functional, and easy to use?  The Boba Organic 2G possesses all the qualifications I mentioned.The official Boba website has a video page that shows you how to use it properly.  I was able to get my 9-month-old in the back carry position on the first try after viewing the videos.  I just prepared lunch with my baby on my back, and she chirped away contentedly the whole time.  She gave her endorsement!The only minor down side is that my little one sucks on the straps, which will make the straps look dingy.  The official website recommends spot cleaning often, and machine washing (gentle cycle) less frequently as it will eventually fade the dark material.  I suspect this is unavoidable on any washable baby carrier.  This was also the case with the Baby Bjorn, which I used when my three kids were 8+ pounds to 15 pounds.  (No more Bjorn backaches for me!)  I may sew some strap covers to prolong the life of the fabric.I spent an inordinate amount of time researching baby carrier reviews before my purchase and am quite pleased that I went with the Boba Organic 2G.UPDATE 9/29/12: I now have a 26-month-old and 7-month-old who benefit from the Boba Organic 2G. The Boba is very easy to adjust to either child, so I use it for both of them on a daily basis. Just last week, I walked the Women's Fitness Celebration 5K with my 26-month-old in the Boba the entire time, and it was quite comfortable the whole way. That was 30 pounds on my back for almost an hour going up and down hills, and I was pushing a stroller AND with my two other children (9 and 5) as well, maneuvering through a 15,000+ crowd. I just love how it distributes most of the weight to the lumbar area with great stability, allowing me to transport the 26-month-old AND carry my 7-month-old in my arms simultaneously (I get lots of comments from smiling people - ""that's quite a load you have there!""). I wholeheartedly recommend this carrier!",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",My son used it until he was about 7 months old and he was one big baby. Love this carrier. it is so adjustable and SO incredibly easy to adjust on you.,5
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"I'm kind of upset about this, as the description posted here on Amazon says to 52"", but in the manual it says to 50"".I hope when I put this up, it fits, because if it doesn't, I'm sending it back.",1
"Britax Kick Mats (2-Pack, Black)","I bought a brand new pilot, these mats were everything I wanted. As you know kids have bad habits of kicking the back of chairs. These work perfect the cover the while back of seat! So now all the dirt goes on the mats and my chair is clean!!!",5
"Kids Line Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier, Flower","I bought this humidifier 2 years ago for our older daughter's room.  With forced hot water baseboard heat, in the winter it is important to humidify the bedrooms at night for comfortable sleeping.  Starting in early toddlerhood she would get bloody noses with some frequency if we didn't run a humidifier; any parent who has had to try to stop a 15 month old's bloody nose will understand why we'd want to avoid that situation!This is a cute humidifier with the little monkey peeking out.  A cool mist humidifier is the best choice in terms of safety for a toddler/small child who might play with or knock the humidifier over.  There are significant downsides to this humidifier, though.  We found that the reservoir is small and needs to be refilled on a daily basis if you're running it on the highest setting.  The entire humidifier is also VERY difficult to clean with a lot of small nooks and crannies that you just can't wash.  Since this is a cool mist humidifier, mold and mildew is a very real concern and between her mild asthma and her baby sister now sharing her room we cannot have mold spores floating round in the mist.After 2 winters of use, I plugged it in tonight and discovered it won't produce mist anymore.  I guess we got our money's worth with 2 winters of daily use, but we will either be replacing it with our Crane teardrop cool mist humidifier or a warm mist unit.",2
"Bright Starts Around We Go Activity Station, Doodle Bugs",I bought this when my daughter was about 9 months old because I wanted something that could entertain her but keep her from crawling around while I was getting ready in the morning.  The basket seat thing didn't last long--she quickly figured out it was more fun to play with it with out the restraint!  But the &#34;mushroom&#34; part is still every bit as entertaining as it was when she was a baby--and she's 2 now!  I've never had a baby toy remain interesting for so long!,5
Dr. Brown's 6 Pack Natural Flow Level 3 Standard Nipple,My baby had no problem with these nipples.  The flow rate was perfect and they are high quality like all Dr. Brown's products.,5

Evenflo Soft And Wide Gate Taupe &amp; Chocolate,"We have an extra wide staircase and this gate is PERFECT!!! It was a great price, too. I love that it is so easy to put up and take down. We travel often too and it is great to be able to put it up in multiple size stairways. We looked at many gates from several websites and this was definitely the best deal!",5
"JJ Cole Bundleme Original Weather Resistant, Gray Circle, Toddler","This is very warm in cold weather.  However, you still have to cover with a blanket as the top does not zip and cold air can get to the baby.",4
Traffic Light Lamp,This is not very large but it makes a great nightlight for my sons cars themed room. the 1st one we had blew out like a Christmas light after about 6 months. It was cheaper to replace then to fix so we are on outer second one.,3
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator CRYSTAL With Extra Nose Tip and Mouth Piece | #1 Tested Snot Sucker,"We LOVE the Baby Comfy Nose. It works extremely well at removing congestion from our three month old son's nasal passages. He still fusses and squirms away, but we have more success with this than either the bulb sucker or the electric suckers.",5
Disney Minnie Fluttery Friends Window Valance,"This valance looks absolutely adorable with the matching bedding, held up great in the washing machine and the colors are very vibrant.",5
"Kushies Receiving Blanket, Blue Dots",Not the softest blankets. Print is only on one side and kind of just shows through the other which makes it somewhat unattractive. Doesn't wash up particularily well either. Probably would not recommend.,3
Boppy Water Resistant Protective Cover,works great! would highly recommend to keep your boppy protected with how expensive they are. it is very water resistant,5
Giant Panda Bear Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"This was one of the few motives I could find, that would be usable for both - girl and boy, since I didn't wanna know the gender and I could only find pink flowery or blue car stuff. Since I don't like the idea of blue vs pink for almost everything, I always buy neutral stuff. It's a nice set, came in a nice little suitcase. I only use the bedsheets and the bumper since my baby is too little for a pillow and blanket. The diaper stacker and the toy bag (I use it for my personal stuff) are useful too. The bib is a little poor quality and those window valances didn't find their purpose in my apartment. I don't know how long it will last but after the first washing, the thread of the panda pictures already started to ravel out. So I assume that's why the price as it is but I wouldn't spend 150 for bed sheets anyway.",4
Bee Smart Trike Zoo 3 in 1,"Received the trike yesterday.Very bright nice color, all components feel solid and nice build.It wasn't as bad as other reviewer described to put the trike together. If you do have problem to assembly, check the company website to watch the product assembly demo.The handle to push the trike around do feel a little shaky when you extend it to the highest position.Only tried on hardwood floor, I guess it feel worse when you push it outside on rough surface.",5
"Prince Lionheart Corner Guards, Chocolate Brown","There is no baby in my home; just a senior citizen on Coumadin therapy who bruises very easily. The sharp corner of my chest of drawers is right next to the closet door, and my balance is a bit poor. Therefore my arm was always covered with bruises where I bumped into the corner of the chest. This corner protector does not look great, but it does the job, and was easy to put on. Since I only need one I have spares if I need them elsewhere.",3
PumpEase Classic Collection hands-free pumping bra - Verry Cherry - M,"This is a great product! I wish I had thought to get one of these from the very beginning as it would have made keeping up with pumping so much simpler. The materials and construction seem to be very good quality and the print is adorable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I feel like the fit was a bit loose. I ordered based on the sizing measurements (I am very large chested), but it didn't fit quite as snugly as I would have liked. I would suggest ordering a size smaller than they recommend since it really needs to be snug to hold the pump in place.",4
"Lansinoh mOmma Feeding Bottle, 5 Ounce",We tried 8 different bottles for our 8 week old (exclusively breastfed baby) with no luck! Our pediatrician gave me this bottle at her 8 week checkup after I explained our issue. My daughter latched on to this bottle right away and took 3 ounces. This bottle has been a lifesaver and has given me a few hours of freedom to leave my baby! I am going to try the newer non-round model too. The ounce reader on this model is VERY faint which is my only complaint. If you are having bottle issues please give this one a try. We love it!,5
"Phil&amp;Teds Car Seat Adapter For Graco Snugride To Classic, Explorer, Navigator, Dot, And S4 - Main Seat","I got this after amazon telling me it was for the dot.I was upset when I got it and the box didn't state it was supported for the DOT.I went on the P&T; website and found that it is in fact supported for the DOT.It works great and now I can move my infant from car to stroller in his graco carseat.I use with a doubles kit on the back for my 17m old to ride in.This is great.*note on the phil & teds dot with doubles kit. You cannot close the dot with the doubles kit on the back, but you CAN close the dot with the car seat adapter on it.",5
CherryCreek Decals Cherry Blossom &amp; Birds Decorative Nursery/Room Wall Sticker Decals,"Easy to put on, comes with instructions. So far it has been up & on the wall for a week & has yet to fall off or start to peel. I bought it for my 13 year old to do up her room in & she loves it. Does not look nursery(ish) at all. Will buy more from this company.",4
Levana BABYVIEW20 Interference Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby Camera,"What a great monitor.  We originally bought the Summer Infant Day & Night Handheld Color Video Monitor, but returned it due to the constant static.  We also could see two other children in the neighborhood on the Summer monitor....scary!  The BabyView is amazing and I would recommend to anyone who wants to keep a close eye on their baby!",5
"Izzy Farmtasia Nursery Blanket, On the Farm for Boys","Did I buy a blanket or an oversized baby towel?  While it said blanket, I had pictured it in the style of a comforter in my mind.  The description should be a lot more clear as to what kind of material from which this is made.  While the design is cute, it definitely was not worth the money that I spent.",2
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I have loved this product! My baby is now 6 months old and doesn't always want veggies with cereal. However, with this product, I just make a whole bunch of ice cubes with whatever pureed veggies I want, plop the cube in the feeder and she gets the vitamins and relief from teething! I plan to freeze pureed soups with meat and veggies later in this fashion. My only concern--some of the edges are a little sharp.",4
Lansinoh Diaper Rash Ointment 3 oz (85 g),I love this ointment!  A friend of mine told me about this ointment and she was right - it works super fast and you just have touse a little bit!  To meit's worth the hefty price tag.,5
Safety 1st 10 Pack Spring n' Release Latches,This product is terrible. It is not possible to install these in a way that you don't have to push down on the spring each time you want to close the door. I'm going to buy the simple cantilever ones.,1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","Pretty pink shade, easy to use and helps make a great seal with the flanges.  I love that it is adjustable!",5
"OXO Tot Divided Feeding Dish, Aqua","This is a nice dish, but more of a hassle because I don't re-heat in plastic & the extra pieces are annoying & not helpful.  Maybe when my child it older it will be more useful.",3
Skip Hop Duo Diaper Bag BLACK,"The delux has better features however this is the best diaper bag.  It's not bulky, however fits everything.  i love the color red, it looks so cool on the stroller and doesnt bother me at alll.",5
Bento Decoration - Food Picks (Animal) 15pcs,"These are winning me """"mommy of the year"""" awards from my 4 year old daughter! She thinks they are so cool.  They are small but she likes using them as forks.  I put cubed ham on them and sent her a """"zoo"""" in her lunchbox.",5
WubbaNub Giraffe,"My son loves all of his wubbanubs. He piles them up in his crib and snuggles with them. They dont bounce away, he easily learned to put them back into his mouth, & they lie flat on his Chest. When he was younger, they tucked easily into his swaddle & car seat restraints. I just wished they were easier to clean since there's no way to detach the pacifier from the stuffed animal.",4
"Kaloo Plume Lilac Bear, Medium",We all love this fat bear :-)  Even like its box.Hope it can help my 6 months daughter sleep well.,5
"Munchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Vary","I tried to put frozen grapes or strawberries in here for my teething daughter... I liked the idea of the cold to soothe her gums and also adding some fruit to her diet without the choking hazard.  Unfortunately, the netting is so thick, none of the juice made it to her mouth, so she was essentially sucking on a cold net.  As you might imagine, she lost interest in this ""treat"" very quickly.",3
OsoCozy Birdseye Flat Cloth Diapers - 27x27 inches (dozen),"Children grown and gone, I have no use for &#34;nappies&#34; for little tots. But as cloth for polishing motorcycles and cars they are great and highly recommended!.",5
Jolly Jumper Sneak a Peek Sneak-a-Peek Infant Carseat Cover Deluxe Gray,Fits perfectly over Graco carseat. Used it during peak winter for our newborn and it keeps the baby warm and cozy.,5
"Lifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Sky/Spring Green","My daughter started teething at just over 4 months.  This have been amazing for her. She loves to chew on these rings.  Sometimes I put them in the freezer so that they are cold when I first give them to her.  The packaging said they could be chilled in the freezer but don't expect them to stay cold for long.  She loves to rub her gums back and forth over the different textures. They are also lightweight and easy to attach to a pacifier clip so that she can't toss it over the side of her car seat/stroller/bouncy seat.Overall, these are absolutely perfect for any teething baby!!",5
"Under the Nile Organic Cotton Onesie - Long Sleeved, Blue 3-6m","I love Under the Nile products in general, and this onesie is no exception.  My daughter started wearing this around the 2 month mark.  She was 8lb 3oz at birth, and she is cloth diapered, so she outgrew her newborn sized clothes quickly.  I found myself scrambling to find some organic onesies with foldover cuffs for bedtime use.  Let me explain: until she was about five months old, her little fingers would be FREEZING cold even if the rest of her was toasty warm. The foldover cuffs warmed up her fingers--at least until about four and a half months, when she just refused to obey the system any longer.  (Luckily she fixed the cold finger situation on her own...)Fast forward, she is six months old, and she still fits into this onesie, even though she is about 18 pounds (and cloth diapered, which adds bulk around the midsection).I think you'd be hard pressed to find a onesie that is as well made as these.  Everything from the seams to the snaps are top notch.  In addition, the onesie fits kimono style, so there is an extra layer of fabric over baby's tummy.  Sure, they are more expensive.  But you can rest easy knowing your little one is wearing chemical free clothing that is both safe and warm.  We use these each night with a sleepsack and couldn't be happier.",5
Summer Infant Deluxe Comfort Booster- Tan,I guess you get what you pay for...it's ok but usually takes two adults to maneuver a baby into it.....the tray is difficult to slide onto the tracks.,3
"Carters 5-Piece Girls Diaper Bag Set - brown/pink, one size",I though it would have been made better but it's good for the price! But I did find myself buying another diaper bad this one doesn't zip afraid of things falling out,3
Ergo Baby BCP32300LED Performance Carrier With a LED Safety Reflector Light - Spring Green,Super comfy once you get the pack and kido on. The hard part is getting this on without help. Once you get the pack on it feels great! Takes the weight off your back and hips. Overall I would recommend but suggest to have help putting on.,3
"Chicco Polly High Chair, Chevron","this is the WORST. We've endured it, but I can't any more! All 3 of my children have been able to wiggle right out of the straps, no matter what we do and climb out. SO DANGEROUS!!",1
"OXO Tot Tub Drain Stopper, Blue",It's not really a stopper in that it goes into the drain and plugs it - it really just suctions over the drain. It took a few tries to get a good fit - it kept wanting to float away. But we got it to work and it keeps water in the tub.,3
"Safety 1st Prograde Toilet Lock, White and Silver - 1 Pack","This really is a great product.  It was easy to install and easy to use; one-handed open and one-handed close, but certainly too difficult for a baby or toddler to break through.  It is a little difficult to clean around it, but no impossible.  From what I have seen, this is the best toilet lock out there now.  I bought two more after installing it on the main floor of our house.",5
Nuby Octopus Bath Time Toss,"Great idea but it can use some design changes. The head is too small to fit on a faucet that has the train lever. Once it's on it takes some muscle to get it off. So if you have lots of bath time and a drain lever, this is a pain.",4
Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor,"Just got this yesterday, the product they sent me was the ""boost"" version of this same baby monitor, which is the new model but not the model I ordered, that concerns me only because I researched both the boost and the older model and it appeared as though this model was better then the newer one. I didn't call, I figured well I will go ahead and try this one. Turned it all on and everything sunk immediately. The daytime picture is nice and clear, nighttime looks the same as the $100 Vtech monitor that I sent back. But then again, I just don't see these baby video monitors being perfect without a very hefty price tag, more then any of them are now anyway. The monitor seems very fragile, if I really like this one I will order the silicone case for it, yet another expense but probably worth it. I love the fact that the video portion can be turned off manually for at night, it also goes out automatically if you're running on battery power. There are not a whole lot of other options other then adjusting the brightness and adding/deleting cameras. My house is all one story basically, so it is very spread out, probably 100-150 feet and 4+ walls in between my sons room and ours and it seems to be OK from his room to ours, but I will say that any little movement or even if I walk in front of it, it gives me that wonderful ""out of range"" silent red X and wording across the monitor. That is probably my BIGGEST complaint, that the monitor does NOT have an alert feature to let you know if it goes out of range. It would be really nice to have that feature with an adjustable volume to it, even an off switch really. Especially for at night, I'd rather have it beeping or something then not know that I won't be able to hear my child. I ordered a second camera so I am looking forward to experiencing this ""scanning"" feature everyone talks about. THAT was the whole reason I returned the Vtech, because what's the point of having it if I can't hear both rooms or all 4 rooms I want to monitor if a child cries?! So far so good, I will update again though because I see how important other peoples reviews are for sure.",4
Leachco Back 'N Belly Chic - Taupe,"I don't know what I would do without this pillow.  I purchased it during my first trimester when I found out I was pregnant and could not live without this pillow.  It supports your back and tummy throughout your pregnancy.  I had to travel for three days without my pillow and had the worst three nights of sleep ever, standard pillows just did not do the job in making me feel compfortable throughout the night.  The color of the cover is very neutral and easy to wash. I've washed it many times and it holds up well. It is so comfy to sleep in that I have even caught my pug puppy sleeping in it while I am at work :) Highly reccomend to anyone pregnant to ease with sleeping at night throughout your pregnancy!",5

Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"When Nathan was first born, this carrier was our way to soothe him when nothing else worked!  My husband or I would place him in the carrier and walk -- putting Nathan to sleep!As months passed, we discovered many other ways this carrier was handy.  I use it to get housework done, Nate helps me make cookies in it, we walk together, and he is much happier for longer periods of time in the store in this than he is in the cart.  For alert babies that are happiest to see what is going on, this is the way to go!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5
"Snoozy Organic Cotton Waterproof Multi Use Pad, 27&quot; x 36&quot;","I ordered two of these off-hand when I was pregnant. Now I have four. I wish there was an even larger size now that my baby rolls and scoots on her belly all over the place - I'd love to have a rug- or bed-sized version. We change her diaper on this, have diaper-free time on it, play on it, and sleep on it. She is a major spitter-upper and this has protected anything she has sat on. She's also peed, pooped, and drooled on them. They clean up beautifully in the washing machine and don't need any special care (I just wash them along with everything else). Looking back over the many pictures I've taken the first 5 months of my daughter's life, this product is in over half of them!",5
"DaVinci Jayden 3-Drawer Changer Dresser, White","This changing dresser was fairly easy to assemble though the instructions are little bit vague.  It arrived at our front door at 3:53pm and was completed at 6:00pm with the help of my fiance.  I would defininantly reccommend having two pairs of hands for the main assembly though the drawers can be done by one person.  There is a little bit of an odor but i think it will air out in a couple of days and it's faint anyway. This also comes with an anti-tipping strap to secure to the wall as well as a strap on the changing table part for the little squirmer.  As far as the drawers being flimsy they are slightly but as long as you don't try to stuff them with every thing you own you will be fine. If your looking for a piece that can be handed down for generations this is not it, but if your looking for something that is safe and sturdy enough to last through a couple of kids and won't break the bank, then this is a good buy.",4

FingerGuard SM (3-4 yrs.),"I purchased this for my 3 yr, 4 month old daughter.  The first two days were torture for her.  She screamed for two hours the first two nights and days.  The only time I removed it was at night after she had fallen to asleep to clean it.  I kept it on 24/7 for four straight weeks.  After removing it, she never sucked her fingers again, she completely forgot about the sucking sensation.  I highly recommend this product.",5
"Stork Craft Carrara 4-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, Cherry","First, the crib is amazing, sturdy, and beautiful if you ignore the 2X6 strip of unfinished wood. I spent about 2 hours putting it together and it was beautiful until I pulled the 2X6 government sticker off of the foot board ""part B."" I pulled it off as carefully as I could and 90% of the finish under it came off. Now we have this beautiful crib with a huge spot on it.I called customer service and they are charging me for a ""touch up"" kit to cover the spot that their inferior finish came off of from a sticker they are required to put on the crib. Does anyone leave those stickers on the crib in a spot that is not able to be concealed? Look at the picture of the crib,see the top rail on the end right in the middle, that is where the sticker is. There is another one on the bottom of the opposite rail, but I was able to conceal that one under the bed. I guess $200 isn't enough to spend on a crib, they need to nickel and dime you to take care of the inferior stain/finish they use...",2
"Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump Reducing Flanges BPA Free, 22.5 Mm - 2 Pack","I had to get these when I got the Ameda Purely Yours pump.  The stock flanges on it were 25 mm and that was just a touch too big for my size nipples.  The flanges also fit into the Medela flanges to reduce them too.  I am impressed on how well they actually work.  The only issue I have with them is that they don't stay in the flanges, but you just have to push them in a bit harder and they should stay put.",4
EvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer,"I just received this exersaucer from a relative whose son just outgrew it and it is WONDERFUL!!! This saucer has soooooo many fun functions! It has great sounds and toys! It keeps my 6 month old very occupied. He'll stay in it for about 45 minutes at a time. This saucer has 11 different toys, a mirror, and three hanging rattles. All the toys have a function, whether it be beads in it, fun sounds, colorful shapes and colors, etc... It is not loud or annoying, either, like some toys can be.When it was given to us, the legs nicely folded down and it fit in a normal sized trunk. It will be easy to store for when I pack it up and save it for the next baby.Even though this saucer was given to me, I would have definitely spent the $99 on it. My baby uses it everyday, and the price is well worth it.If you are looking for a great toy that will provide endless hours of fun entertainment for your baby, this is the saucer for you!",5

"Britax Boulevard G4 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","As a grandparent with only occasional need for the seat, the ability to install and remove the seat was important.  The Latch system (supported by my car and Britax) works well, allowing far easier removal and reinsertion than I had feared.The babies are sill young so the seat is still facing backward.  Because the car seats slant downward (knees higher than bottom), the Britax seat wants to pitch down, making the back too straight up, even when in its fully reclined position. The fix is padding on the car seat to level it--not optimal.  The seat should recline farther to better adapt to back slanted car seats.The buckles in the latch system are very easy to tighten, and easy to latch and unlatch.  That said, they are hard to loosen--and this is required to reinstall the seat.  Fiddling for some time with each buckle is needed to add enough slack to reinstall.The seat appears to provide robust protection and the babies are ok with it.  We have not yet had to test the ease of removing and washing the seat cover, but a trial run suggests that this feature will work fine. The 4 stars rating reflects these essential features. However, there is still room for improvement in my opinion.",4
Bummis Original Wrap - Small - White,"My son is 1 month old and about 10 pounds. I use these covers with the Bummis and Bumpkin pre-folds. They do a great job at preventing leaks as long as you change the pre-fold immediately which is difficult to do unless you want to constantly stick your finger under the cover and check it. I very rarely get a ""blow out"" with these diapers which is awesome because my son constantly blows out of the Pampers or Huggies every time he goes poo.The MAJOR downside to this diaper cover is the velcro. The more I wash these covers, the more mangled the velcro tabs get. The rough velcro tabs do not sit flush on the diaper cover which causes the corners of the tabs to poke out and rub against the soft skin of my son's belly. The velcro doesn't bother him when he is lying down flat, but once I sit him up (and his belly sticks out) or I cradle him (and his waist is bent) then the velcro rubs and irritates his delicate skin. This downfall is enough to make me discontinue use of these covers. I'll be sure to never purchase velcro covers ever again!",1
Deluxe Muscle Chest - The Flash,My 3 year old loves his flash costume.  He was the only Flash we saw this year.  The muscles go a little high and hit his chin and the sleeves are a little snug but that doesn't seem to bother him just makes it hard to take off.  This would be a great costume or dress up item for any Flash fan,5
CHILL BABY Mustache Pacifier,"I was a riot. Put it in my grandson's Easter basket and it brought many laughs and pictures, fun, fun!",5
"Bumbo Floor Seat, Aqua",We absolutely love this for our baby who is 4 months old. It has helped him learn to sit up. My only complaint is that our baby is only 4 months old and is getting too big for it!,4
"Stephan Baby My Best Friend 14&quot; Rag Doll with Removable Outfit, Lindsay","This was a very disappointing buy. The outfit is not easily removable at all, especially not for a child. The hair of the doll falls out.",1
6 Baby Love All-in-One Cloth Diapers,"I used disposables, always wanting to use cloth, when we decided to have another child, I made the commitment.  I have Fuzzi Bunz and these.  I don't know if it's the way we are trying to use the Fuzzi's , but they leak A LOT!!!  These are great, they take a little longer than the pocket diapers to dry, but they are very absorbant and don't leak!!!!  We put a fleece liner in to keep the pee off of my son's skin, and to catch the poop.  The fabric did stain a little, but it's hardly noticable!  It's a diaper anyways, who cares?  I want to try out some BumGenius and see if I like them better......but I think these are better than Fuzzi Bunz.....I don't think these are going to fit my newborn when it's born, but I got some Kushies Premie and Fuzzi Bunz small......I hope they don't blow out with those newborn poopies......",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",This is a great product.  Our grandson loves the buttons and moves easily around the house.,5
"Goldbug Animal 2 in 1 Harness, Horse","We got this frog harness for our 4-year-old son for a cruise.  We had to take two airplanes, wait in airports, ride busses, and get ourselves onto the ship.  He didn't mind having the ""froggy backpack"" on at all.  He thought of it more as a stuffed animal friend hitching a ride on his back.  It's super soft and super cute.  We got a bunny one for our 2-year-old, and she loved hers, too.  I would recommend these for parents who don't want to have to carry their kids around in heavily populated public areas.  They were a hit with our family!",5
Mommy's Helper Safe-Lok Cabinet Door and Drawer Lock,"I liked these locks.  They were easy to install and worked well.  I had tried several other brands, and found they were a pain to install and my son could open up the cabinets!  These finally worked.",4
Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,Love this product! Easy to use especially when warming bottles in the middle of the night while half asleep. If this bottle warmer was cordless it would be even better. Nevertheless I love it.,5
"Nuby Suction Bowl with Spoon and Lid, Colors May Vary",The bowl is fine but I was expecting three as there were three in the picture. I'm sure it says somewhere that there is only one but I didn't spend that much time reading the small print of a plastic bowl......,3
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"This potty is great. As the previous reviewer mentioned, it's one piece so nowhere for the pee to go except inside. I think the only fault is that it's incredibly low to the ground, so although that is great for new learners, once they master the potty training and you just need an extra around the house, it doesn't encourage them to go because it's too short. If you can spend a bit more, the newer model with the inside that comes out ($24.95) is much better in my opinion. HIgher for sure, and actually easier to dump since it has an insert. Make sure never to use bleach in these, though, I ruined the bottom of one of these by letting it sit in a 50% bleach solution, it ate away the smooth bottom.",4
Cosco Scenera Convertible Car Seat Black,"We bought two of these seats to fly with since they are much lighter than our regular Roundabout seats. I would describe them as ""tolerable"" but not much better. I found it virtually impossible to get a tight fit in the car. Kneeling on the seat and pulling the strap as hard as I could managed only a loose fit, which my husband could only improve a little bit. Getting the shoulder straps even is also sometimes a challenge; sometimes you get one shoulder strap that's much tighter than the other side. Adjusting this  makes the process of buckling in two kids longer than it needs to be. We'll probably use the seats again when we fly (since I won't care much if the airline damages them!), but we'll definitely stick with the Roundabouts for everyday use.",2
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Basket, Espresso",This is a great basket for the price. I keep it on our tv stand to hold items in place.,5
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler",Great little chair! Baby is 8 weeks now and really enjoys the toy bar. Would love it if FP could create an auto shut-off for the vibrating motor ;very easy to forget to shut that button off when you're thinking about getting baby up to change or feed. Love the fact that the baby chair can be converted into a toddler's chair; one of few baby products that can be used for more than 6 months!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,We love this potty...it's not complicated like other pottys. It's easy to empty and clean...the seat seams comfortable for my daughters tiny butt... She loves to sit on it...glad we chose this one over the other cheap pottys.,4
"Trend Lab Storage Caddy, Ultrasuede Brown/Pink","I purchased this to carry and store my variety of fish food, since I have several tanks located throughout my house, I wanted something that was cute that I could carry from tank to tank. Well this item fit the bill. It's sturdy and it comes with a divider that can be removed. The one thing I'm not that found of is it's very difficult to fasten the bottom buttons on the dividers. As long as you can keep the top ones fastened, the dividers are not going to move. This is a very roomy bag, but it's not really high. I would really recommend it to those who want to carry their crafts (or fish food and medication)or anything you'd like to be able to cart around the house.",5
"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light 2, Black",Light Beautiful design  We have used it in many different locations and it is very easy to set up. Another great Bjorn product,5
Susen Safe Shampoo Shower Bathing Protect Soft Cap Hat for Baby Children Kids (Blue),"It works ok, some water gets between the head and the cap, so is not a perfect solution. But it is great for the price.",3
Graco Cuddle Cove Playard - Minnie Mouse,This same pack n play is sold at Babies R Us for 209.99... and they always have a 10-20% off coupon you can use to get it even cheaper.... this price on here is rediculous!,1
"Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemats with Reusable Pop-up Travel Case, 50-Count",These are high quality and the carrying case is nice. I like the designs and as my 13 month old grows she'll interact with it more. My daughter is facile with her fingers and has not ripped these off. Also they do not ruin tables,5
"Summer Infant Sure and Secure Bedrail, White","I've purchased Summer bedrail in blue a few years ago and was pleased. I decided to purchase one in white for my daughter's room.  Construction has changed. The middle pole protrudes onto the bed significantly that a child could hit it during the night. Also, warning message is written in black bold lettering on the outside of the rail. Not something I want to see when I walk into my girl's room.",2
Safety 1st Bath Toy Bag,Great Product for the bath tub....Nice and sturdy net to keep bath toys in one place also the net prevents the toys from getting moldly,5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Slipcover, Blue","This cover is just OK.  I'm surprised at some of the reviews praising the softness; it just is not as soft as the cover that came with my Deluxe (which was the Periwinkle one).  It's also slightly smaller and the closing mechanism and velcro is not to the standard of the Periwinkle one.  I use theMy Brest Friend Professional Slipcoverover the pillow itself for waterproofing, and the inferior softness (and thinness of the fabric) is much more obvious then (though not with the original cover).  It's OK in a pinch (if the original one is in the wash), but look for one of the others instead (like the Periwinkle, which apparently isn't on Amazon, orMy Brest Friend Deluxe Nursing Pillow - Sweet Blossom).",3
"Peg-Perego 2010 Pliko P3 Stroller, Java","I wish I had purchased this stroller when I had my first child.  The quality is great, easy to handle, perfect for traveling and everyday use!!  Absolutely love EVERYTHING about it!  Would definitely recommend it to anyone! The Peg Perego official website is a great source for details on this stroller.  It is a little expensive, but completely worth every penny.",5
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump,Don't waste your money on a pump that is just $20-$30 cheaper and don't spend an extra $100-$150 on a pump just for the name that is on it.  As someone that exclusively pumps thus using this pumps multiple times a day - I love it! (As much as you can love a pump)  It is very efficient and I love that it is a closed system.  The extra parts they send you are a lifesaver.  It is also not bulky and it very easy to transport back and forth to work.,5
Medela Freestyle Breast Pump,"I was so excited to upgrade to this pump after being really happy with my old pump-in-style (which still works like new after 2 years of heavy use and 2 years of storage--I just wanted one for home and office), so I was disappointed to see that this had so many disadvantages in comparison: the motor on the pump makes a really odd and annoying sound, the bottle attachment didn't fit my glass bottles so they leaked (the pump-in-style's fit fine), and the attachments that help make this a &#34;hands free&#34; pump are so complicated and flimsy they're not worth it. I returned it and just got the new pump-in-style, and I'm so happy with it. Even better than the old model, it's light-weight and less bulky.  And I use it hands-free all the time just by strategically placing the bottles when I pump. In my opinion, this pump was definitely not worth the extra money and I would hate pumping if this was my only idea of what a breast pump was like.",1
DaVinci Elizabeth II Convertible Toddler Bed in White,"After much indecision about which toddler bed to get, we got this for our 2-yr-old. It came undamaged and is absolutely beautiful. Took about 30min to put together. Fairly simple if you have assembled baby furniture b4. Our girl loves it! She is a flippy sleeper and with both rails it is very safe, yet she can still get in and out herself. She also stays in it all night and I think that's because if feels like her crib. We had been having trouble getting her to get into her crib at bedtime, but now she jumps right into her ""big-girl bed"".  I highly recommend this bed!",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",This product is well constructed and is easy to setup.  It also looks good.  This was purchased to keep my dog from jumping on the storm door and breaking the glass and screen.,5
"Britax Marathon 70 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","First of all the Britax brand of car seat is the same brand we have in our other car. It is a different model, the boulevard, and it is great. We truly love the all around ease of the Marathon 70, from installation to the height and security adjustments.  My wife and I are firm believers in the side impact protection and hope to never have test its effectiveness, but feel comfortable knowing it is there. We will use the Britax seats until our kids no longer fit into them which is an astonishing 70 pounds. These seats are the best",5
Universal Baby Food Jar Storage &amp; Organizer,"I have a very small kitchen so space is hard to come by and baby food jars take up quite a lot of space.  I wasn't sure if this was going to be another product that seems like a good idea but then becomes another thing that gets pushed around....I was happily wrong.  The organizer is very sturdy so I was able to place it on the counter, although I could have easily put it in a drawer as the height allowed it to fit in most of my drawers, and put my heavier cookbooks on top.  The 4 seperate sections allow me to seperate my fruits and my veggies and the incline of each section is helpful in that I don't have to dig into it to retreive the jars as I use them.  I was worried that I might have to tilt the organizer forward to get to them and was pleseantly surprised that they move down automatically.  I will probably need to get one more so that I can have a full weeks supply ready but I can tell that they will stack nicely on top of each other or side by side which I will most likely do.",5
"Tilty Sippy Cup, Clear, 7 Ounce, 2 Pack","In general, the Tilty cup seems to be a hit with my son. (He has hated every other sippy we tried) When I handed it to him the FIRST thing he did was put the spout in his mouth, tilt the cup up, and start drinking (VICTORY!!!)  After that, he decided he wanted to try sucking on the bottom of the cup, which wasn't ideal, because there isn't any sort of valve mechanism in this cup to keep the water from leaking.  So it leaked all over the place.  :\\ The plastic lid is also pretty flimsy, so I don't expect this cup to last a super long time but the price was right and again my child will actually USE this sippy, so I can't complain too much.  (You can also buy replacement lids on amazon for a couple bucks).  My son seemed to really like the shape of the spout (it's shaped more like the edge of a cup - like a crescent shape - rather than a nipple or nubbin type shape), the lack of handles, and the fact that he didn't have to tip his head all the way back and stare at the ceiling just to get a drop of water out.  Also, one thing I don't like about the Playtex sippys is that they have that double valve insert thing.  With the valve installed, you need to suck pretty hard to get anything out.  With the valve removed, I feel like water just pours out.  The good thing about the Tilty is there is no valve (so the drinking hole is just open) but there is also no vent hole (so you do have to suck on the cup *a little bit* to get stuff to flow out.) It seemed like just the right amount of resistance to flow, if that makes sense.  Also, not having a valve means one less piece for mommy to wash.  So there you go.  Pro: my kid likes it.  Con: it leaks a bit and probably won't last forever",4

Lovin Hug Swing - Orchard,"I usually dont write review but I m writing this one so that more babies dont suffer the way my wife and son did. The motor is very noisy and consumes batteries very quickly. The specs said it would work for babies upt 25 lbs but when my son got to 14 pounds even at top speed the swing would barely move, baby would wake up all the time. We were manually rocking the swing and finally it broke down, I mean literally. Finally I went ahead and bought Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing from Fisher Price, its a bit expensive but totally worth it. My son has very sound sleep and loves the overhead toys, music and light. It hardly makes any noise, battery lasts long and easily carries around 20 lbs. By the way dont under estimate the cost of batteries. Moral of the story is Fisher Price is a lot better atleast the model I mentioned. Hope this helps you guys.",1

Disney Friendship Pooh Embroidered Boa Blanket,"I've purchased this item after reading it's review and i am very satisfied with it. It is very soft and good size, may fit for up to 1 year baby,maybe even more. Only thing is that i thought the material would be thicker, i don't think it will be good for winter, for the rest of the year you can use it perfectly.",4
"NUK Trendline Silicone Spout Learner Cup, Blue/Orange Dots, 5-Ounce",It is so easy for my 14 months old to hold. Actually he was holding it fine since he was 10 months old. I also love the fact that it doesn't have a valve. The spill-proof is built in.,5
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","I had my doubts when I pulled it out of the package ,but after I got this thing snapped together (I had a hard time seeing the directions) it's worked flawlessly. As for keeping odors at bay it works great to. I like how it works. Pull the plastic out, tie it ,when its full cut it off (the little cutter they have in there works slick) tie the other end and you're done!",5
"Peg-Perego 2011 Prima Pappa Diner High Chair, Naif Rose","We have this high chair and we love it. My daughter has been sitting in it for two months.  I love that the height on the chair adjusts, she can be at dining rooom table height or up higher equal to our kitchen counter.  It has good safety straps, it is easy to clean and wipe down.  The tray is perfect for eating or giving her toys to play with while I do dishes.  This high chair is extremely durable and well made.  It is a little bit expensive compared to some other high chairs, but it is worth the money.  I plan to use this chair over and over during the years to come.",5
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,This is a cute little peek-a-boo story book.  It's soft.  It's safe.  And it is easy for baby to handle.,4
Fisher-Price Lollipop Rattle,It looks very cute but is extremely dangerous for your baby due to the fact that it is very hard and heavy so when she swings it around and hits herself in the face it hurts her... Not very well designed or baby friendly since it's a rattle made for shaking,1
"Safety 1st Comfy Bath Cushion, Green",These are so hard to find in the stores.  I use these in the bottom of my special needs daughters bath chair.  She does not like the mesh feeling on the seat and this keeps her from slipping around.  I have had many before and I have even washed them in the washing machine a few times to make them last a little longer.  I always order two or three at a time so I can have them on hand.,5
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Natural, Tan Stripe, Medium","I got the tan Sleepyhead Bunny and the light blue one for my grandkids, who are nearly one and two years old. I think they are perfect for this age; no removable parts to choke on or get lost. They are machine washable on cold inside a pillow case. The bunnies are so cute in their stripey pajamas, and the velour material that makes up the rest of the bunnies (the feet, hands and head) is super soft and cuddly. Wonderful baby gift; can't wait to see how they like them!",5
bumGenius One-Size Hook &amp; Loop Closure Cloth Diaper 4.0 - Blossom,I love these! My son is 18 mo and we have used them since he was 3mo and they still hold out. We tried the g diapers but they were way more work to keep clean and the Velcro caught on the shells and made them look worn out. The bumgenius are easy to wash and assemble and the sizing was great for little to big (my 18mo wears 2T). You have to use good detergent though or they will leak. My mother in law used her detergent and I had to wash them all in Charlie's soap. Which has worked great for us.,5
Safety 1st Jumbo Edge Protectors,"As the name suggests, these edge protectors are bigger/wider so they won't fit small/narrow edges.  They are thick enough to protect little heads from bumps.  They adhere well and stay put (provided that you do it right and clean the surface where the protector is to go).  At the same time, they are fairly easy to remove; I say ""fairly"" as you will have to use a little force to pull it off.  Didn't damage any of our furniture when removed.Package contains 4 edge protectors.  Each is 17 inches long. The side of the protector (from side edge to center) is almost 2 inches. And it is almost 1/2 inch thick.They work great for us and I highly recommend them.  Saved our baby lots of pain and bumps.  I only wish Safety 1st made them in different colors (the ones we got are sort of tan colored).",5
Ambient Market Maven Stock Exchange Tracking Instrument,"First off, if you are considering this or any other Ambient Devices gadget, it is absolutely essential that you check the coverage map on Ambient's website, and take a good hard look at the area you plan on using this device. If you're in a spot where it's hard to get radio or cellular coverage, chances are this device won't work for you.This gadget is a standalone item that gets a data feed from Ambient, and shows you the current state of the Dow Jones, NASDAQ, and S&P; 500 exchanges. It gives the current position, change, and a rough graph of activity over the day, as well as the time of day and if the market is currently open or not. It can also display your custom portfolio, but that comes at an extra cost per month. The 3 main stats are provided free of charge with the device.That's all.It works by receiving a low speed data stream broadcast by Ambient over the Flex pager network, so if you have pager coverage in your area this will probably work ok. It uses 3 AAA batteries, and they seem to last a decent amount of time - at least 3-4 months per set.Since it has the time of day on it as well, I'm using it as a geeky desk clock, something for which it works quite well.",5
Disney Lion King Bumper,"Great quality, prefect for my crib I purchased. I machine washed it and dried it and it's still in prefect condition.",5
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Kristy","I purchased this product for my parents to have for when we visit them from out of town.  As a very part time use car seat, it is acceptable especially for the price.  It was pretty easy to install and compact enough so it did not overwhelm the back seat of their SUV like some car seats can (two adults could still sit back there with the car seat installed). That being said, i would not want to have this as my primary car seat for teh following reasons:1.  The buckles (chest buckle and anchor buckle) are a bit flimsy and both took a bit more effort to detach.  They reminded me of the buckles in my infant car seat which I did not like at all.  The straps were easy to twist which can be a real annoyance.  I can see these buckles wearing out after a certain period of time and becoming more difficult to unhook.2. I got this when my child was 1.5 years and less than 20 lbs but tall.  She sort of sat in the chair slumped over dn the stranps although tight as per manufacture recommendatins, she was still slumped over especially when she was sleeping and despite trying to resposition or change the straps, this continued to be a problem.  It somehow looked like she was more sitting inside a bucket and less in a car seat (like she sits in our full time Britax...which is an amazing seat).I would not recommend this for a primary car seat.",3
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"What a great idea - play CDs for your baby instead of the grating MIDI noise from kid toys. Unfortunately this product is a disaster. First - the company put in the cheapest possible speaker. I am not kidding. My laptop has better speakers. You can barely make out the music. Second, there is no skip protection (which EVERY portable CD player has, these days), so the slightest jostle skips the CD. Third, it EATS batteries and there is no AC Adapter option. Seriously, save your money and get a boom box or traditional portable CD player with external speakers. You will be sorry if you buy this.",1

"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","We purchased this car seat with the travel system in the Miro design.  The car seat was awesome and I suggest it to anyone I know.  Consumer reports rates it as the #1 rated car seat for over 20 lbs for infant car seats.  It was easy to use, easy to carry, and I washed the car seat cover a few times and it was easy to remove and put back on.  It is worth it's weight in gold!!!!!!!  I highly recommend it!!!!",5

Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,I am a mother of 3 and I formula fed my first 2 and I was very nervous about nursing the 3rd.  This pump (and my glider rocker) are the two things that I have to say have made my nursing experience a success.  I have just started to pump and feed my son a bottle once or twice a day so weaning wont be so hard but I have used the pump from the beginning to help with my god awful engorgement.  I find this pump less painful than nursing no sore nipples.  It is also fast I have never used an electric pump but this is quick enough for me.  I can fill a 4 oz. bottle to the rim (so aprox. 5-51/2 oz.) in 6 minutes. I would recommend this pump to anyone who is even considering breasfeeding it isnt extremely expensive and it works great.,5
Imiss Party In The Tub Light For Children Bath Time,"My kids (2 and 5 years old) LOVED this.  But it took on water horribly.  The first night I unscrewed it and dried it out.  The second night I decided to just leave it and see if it would eventually drain out.  It didn't.  The water was brown with battery acid.  I attemped to rinse it out, but it was ruined.  My kids are very disappointed.  If you decide to purchase the light, I think you will need to unscrew it and let it dry out every night.  But it was nearly fun enough to go through all of that!",2
Alphabet With Animals Foam Play Mat,"We purchased this mat for the playroom. When the product arrived we were excited to see that it looks great, but didn't realize that it is a choking hazard for children under 3 years of age.

We like it so much we're planning to save it for later, but wish that there had been a 3+ note in the description of the product!",4
Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub,"Originally loved this tub but after only 4 months of use, it sprung a leak. And we had been taking care to hag it and dry it per recommendations with each use. The manufacturer was of little help. Though they agreed to replace it, the process takes three weeks and they won't send a replacement until you cut a huge hole in your existing tub to prove it's been destroyed.  They didn't answer the phone promptly and when I had to leave voice messages I NEVER received a call back.  Very frustrating.  Big hassle, find another tub with a higher rating because you may be replacing this one before long, at your own expense.",2

"Quinny Buzz 2009/2010 3 Wheel Stroller, Storm","Got my quinny two years ago when my baby was ready to be born, I have used it since as a stroller and as a nap time bed at the babysitter, I love it!!! Easy to drive, comfortable,good looking, and definitely attention grabber, everybody has something to say about it!!!!!",5
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"Before my baby was born, I thought the concept of wipes warmer was over the top and one of those unnecessary items stores make money off of when new parents are shopping for baby.  Boy, was I wrong!  For the first few weeks after my baby was born, I was dealing with screaming, peeing, and pooing all over me almost every time I changed her diaper.  I knew the wipes felt cold in my hand, but I thought it was normal.  After all, parents have been going without wipes warmers for decades, right?  Well, that may be true, but all I can say is that after being fed up with stressful diaper changes for three weeks, I ordered the wipes warmer and things have been better ever since.  It does require a once a week upkeep of the pillow (rinse and remoisten it), but it's worth it when you're changing 10-12 diapers a day and your baby is content.  I highly recommend this product.",5
"Stork Craft Rocking Horse, Oak","I was not looking to spend $80+ on a  rocking horse, (Plus some of those &#34;higher end&#34; ones are just way more ugly!!)  and I was glad to see this pop up in my search list.  After reading the reviews, I purchased on for my daughter as an Easter gift.She fell in love with it as soon as she saw it, and now she's learned to say &#34;Go go go!&#34;  While riding it.  She's one and a half.Assembly looked easy enough, I had someone else do it because I literally can't put something together than has three pieces because I mess it up.  Did not take my mother long at all and she did not swear while doing it.  Must have been great!",5
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","Let me start by saying we have 4 kids in car seats. Had Alpha Omega's and Graco's. Those were junk, the alpha omega's were infuriating to clean and install, and once we found out how unsafe they were we replaced them with two Britax Frontier's Ver 1.0 and one Britax Marathon. The Frontier Ver 1 is difficult to install but we really have no other complaints. The Marathon is perfect.Thoughts on the new Frontier 85. I had mixed feelings about the ""improvements"" Britax made to this seat. I now think Britax took a good thing and fixed it until its broken. I'm not happy with this seat at all so far and I haven't even gotten around to the obligatory wrestling match that awaits me during installation. Just pulled it out of the box this morning. Tried adjusting it for my 4yr old. The straps are softer but also much thinner and pliable. This means twisting is going to be a common problem. I prefer the thicker and stiffer straps of the older frontier because they dont twist very much. The fabric seat bottom doesn't fit nearly as well on the new version. The slots in the cover for the buckle dont line up the the holes in the plastic anchor positions. Also, rather than fit over and around the entire bottom edge of the seat it has to fit around cup holders. As as result the edges keep coming out of there tracks and cover the cupholders. A ton of dirt and crumbs are going to end up under the cover. The front lip only has two elastic clips at the corners. It definatley needs two more closer to the middle to keep the front from pulling all the way up. I think my kids will rip this with there shoes fairly easily. Perhaps Mine is just defective but the design is still rediculous. $230 seat, you can afford to put a few more elastic clips on the cover and have it wrap around the entire bottom!! I prefer the head restraint adjustment of the Ver 1 much more. It can be adjust without removing the seat. This is handy if you have kids of different sizes that like to swap seating positions once in a while. The new seat has the head adjuster lever halfway down the back of the seat where you would have to loosen the straps or remove the seat to reach the lever.I am strongly considering returning this item.  If I can find Ver 1 anywhere in a seled box I probrably will. Very disappointed.",2
Lite-on-Shoulder Baby Sling,"Wonderful line of colors to choose from, fast shipping, great price and very, very well made. I am so pleased I am going to order another one for me! This one was a gift for my daughter-in-law.",5
My First Birthday Photo Album,The picture shows blue and I got this for a boy when I got it it was purple I was very disappointed in this item.,2
"Delta Universal 6 Drawer Dresser, Black Cherry",the dresser is pretty and matched my delta kalani crib and changing table well.  I like how the dresser is wider and lower than the other dressers I've seen.  The only thing is the drawer isn't all that deep in and one of the dresser is always hard to open and close. I would definitely recommend this product...especially for the price.,4
SafeFit Kick Mats 2-Pack in Black,"I ordered the 2-Pack Kick Mats for our new KIA Sorento. We often have our grandchildren in our car and wanted to protect the backs of the cloth seats, especially the one in front of the 3 year old's car seat. They were easy to install; the elastic slips over the front seat to hold the bottom of the kick-mat in place. The top has velcro strips that fasten around the head rest. They work great. It may be better for some if they had pockets since they cover up the pockets on the back of the seat. We don't use the pockets but some folks may.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I've never even had a problem with it.  There is no odor and I find it very convenient to use garbage bags.  The only thing I do is spray the inside with lysol once in a while.  Even when I change the bag, the only smell is the diapers.  Once they are out, the diaper champ really doesn't have a smell.",5
"Bella Tunno Disposable Bibs, Boy","I received these as a gift prior to going on our first road/airplane trip with our 8 month old.  I honestly didn't really see how they'd come in handy since we have lots of cloth bibs, but threw them in the tote anyway.They are great and I've not stopped thanking the friend who gave them to us.On our 3 day road trip, we were in a different hotel every night.  The first day we used our cloth bibs (didn't remember we had these disposable ones).  That night, I was washing out dirty bibs in the hotel sink, hanging them around the hotel room and hoping they'd dry overnight.  They were still damp the next morning and while drying them with the hotel hairdryer, I remembered these disposables.Voila!  Second day of travel made much easier with these disposables.  Use, then toss.  No laundry, no worrying about having to stuff dirty bibs into plastic bags until you have a chance to wash them out . . . They're actually quite durable as there's a light waterproof coating on them, and if they don't get too wet, you can use one more than once.I guess my only critique of these is their price ($6 for 10 bibs).  Other big brand companies sell boxes of disposable bibs that aren't as pretty for much less.If you plan to use these on a regular basis, cost of these might be an issue, but for a gift or for travel, these are certainly cute, useful and a huge help.",5
Gerber Healthy Start Training Toothbrush Set,"Not a safe item. Terrible quality of this set, after using it 4 times the material/plastic of both items started to disintegrate in my baby's mouth, caution with your babies.",1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper,  Rainforest Friends",This is a Godsend and a must buy for anyone expecting.,5
"Nuby 3 Pack Tinted Bottle, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","The important part of the bottle is the nipple. It works for babies that bit the nipple instead of sucking, because the nipple has a star shape hole when baby sucks or bits, allowing thicker liquids go through. I use this for baby smoothies and for milk with rice cereal. One thing, the hole on  the 7onz  nipple is smaller than the 10 onz. The problem of the 10 onz is that does not fix in my sterilizer. Additionally, the measurement are not in a different color, so its a little bit difficult to see.",4
"Jolly Jumper Insect - Bug Net - Fits Most Strollers, Pack 'N Play, Bassinets, Cradles and Car Seats",It's well sawn and fits our playpen so it's versatility will ensure we use it all summer. Worth the price.,5

Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I bought this bouncer for my neice for her new baby.  It is very colorful and strudy.  The toys click off and on, very easy.  Great service will purchase another one for the next baby shower that we are invited to.",5
"aden + anais 3 Pack Muslin Snap Bib, Jungle Jam",These look much bigger in real life. Therefore ideal for the older baby during feeding time. there are of good quality and quite thick.,5
Tigger High Back Chair,"My son recv'd this as a Christmas gift from his grandparents. At first I thought it was a little junky (and it does look junky with the blue fake fur), but my son loves it! He's three and it's just the right size for him. He watches all of his favorite movies in his special little chair.I have a 20 pound cat named King Mo who spends his spare time in the chair when my son isn't using it. Apprently, he's holding court what with Tigger on the chair and all. It's quite funny to walk into the living room and see a mountain of housecat sprawled out in the seat and over the arm of this little toddler chair!The cover is removable and washable. It zippers on and off. Be sure to air dry this one, though, or you'll have blue fur in your dryer for weeks.This chair also makes a nice footstool to prop up your feet under the computer desk. ;)",5
"Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor, Sliver/White","We received the Summer Infant Best View baby monitor as a gift. After reading reviews about this product, I was skeptical, but hopeful that we would be the lucky ones who received a solid product. Well, after using the video and monitor for just 3 months, the monitor will not project the video image any longer for no reason other than it is not a good product. The monitor only displays either the welcome screen or black. The audio still works; however, partial functionality is not acceptable.I would have rated the product much higher if the monitor did not break in only 3 months. I liked the color view and the remote ability to control the camera. I also like its portability. It just stinks that the product failed so soon.Update 9/17/12: Since the sound still worked, I continued to turn on the monitor to at least listen if my little one was in distress. Surprisingly tonight the video came back on and is working fine again. I guess it will be a good backup for our other monitor.",2
"Maclaren Twin Triumph Stroller, Black/Charcoal",It works for how we need it!  Would get it again for the price.  Right on!  Right on!  Alrighty then!,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Baby LOVES this thing. Bouncebouncebounce, for 5 to 20 minutes at a time depending on her mood. Once she actually leaned forward on the tray and went to sleep in it. Stable enough not to dump her out even when she did that. The plastic tray doubles as a place to play with toys and a stabilizer, it seems.The bumpers really work.  She could theoretically get her fingers caught between the bumper and a doorway now that she's bigger, but the design of the toy tray/bumper makes that unlikely (even now that she's at the upper end of recommended user size).It came out of the box very easy to put together. I can attach it to door frames without any assistance.Only wish it would accommodate larger babies... she's outgrowing it now.By way of comparison:  We also tried the Evenflo Jump Up, but it never seemed put together quite right. Less stable -- the baby would flop over forward in it. Observers wondered if she would fall out. While that never happened, she'd get burns on her arms from leaning on its frame & ropes to stabilize herself.  I had to get help to clamp it into doorways.",5
"J.I.P. Photo Print Bib, Tie","Im a photo nerd so for me this was a must have.  Its super funny and cute on your kido.  FYI I would have loved it but the print it self is almost like an iron on so it cracks and will not hold up over time.  I still gave it 4 stars as its worth it for one photo with it on him or her, but the quality of the product is not that good.  I would not buy again for me but would got a gift for someone else.",4
Playtex Drop-Ins System Breast Milk Storage Kit,"I was going to make this system my storage choice for storing breast milk because it is so easy and convenient.  Being a new mom as of January 2014, I purchased the new 2013 nursers that have the pivot option.  The new nursers are okay, although I do prefer the old 2012 ones.  The storage rings leak on the new nursers.  I lost about an ounce of my hard work when I went to feed my baby.  I am not sure why the system does not work on the 2013 nursers, but they don't, they leak very badly.  Playtex, if your going to change your bottles, make sure everything is still compatible.",2
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle / Foot Finder Set of 4 (2 Wrist 2 Footies),I was surprised to see 3 other sets of wrist ratles given as gifts at the baby shower. I thought they were a new item .There were no foot finders except mine. I like buying the LaMaze brand for confidence. Packaging in a plastic baggie left something to be desired.,5
"Gund Baby Huggybuddy Tucker, Giraffe","This ""lovie"" is the best.  My son received the giraffe from the gift shop at the hospital on the day he was born.  I had forgotten all about it until he was about 8 months old.  Over the course of the next few months, he became very attached and loves this things.  He is now 19 months old and still sleeps with it and loves to hug it when he needs comfort.  It's not called a HuggyBuddy for no reason - it's large & substantial enough for them to grasp and squeeze, unlike some of the other flimsy lovies out there.  It's his buddy.  It's held up very well through multiple (and I mean multiple) washings.  I put it on delicate cycle and dry it on med-low heat.  It's definitely not as fluffy as it was when it was new... but that gives it more character.  The important thing is that it's held up very well, at least in the 11 months of non-stop use thus far.  We had to buy a second in case something ever happens to it. :)",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"This toy is colorful, plays a song and is easy to hold on to. It has a lot of crinkly parts and different textures.",5
Pigeon Baby Nose Cleaning Tweezers Pigeon (Made in Japan),I definitely recommend this! I've been using this since my baby was born. It sooo easy to take out those little buggers that not only bother my 3 month old but me too.,5
"Thirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boy","I use these Fab Wipes on our little baby in combination with the peri-bottle that I got from the hospital.  I love that it's like a nice little bath for her with each diaper change.  To clean them, I just throw the wipes in with her cloth diapers and everything washes up beautifully.  Great product.",5
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,We got this gate to block our dogs from going upstairs when we are not home. We love it. Sure easy to instal and it looks great. The quality is also really good.,5
Taggies Flower Me Fun Plush,I have the taggie flower me fun blanket and my 3 year old loves is so wanted another one for her to take to babysitters. She wanted the plush and does not like it. Its too big to cuddle with and there was no information on it so I didn't know there is a bell inside the pillow which is not good when a child is trying to sleep. I will be opening it up and taking out the stuffing and the bell.,2
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Midnight","I have used this Car Seat now for a few months and I love it and so does my daughter.  I drive a VW Golf so it is not a tall car but I in no way need to slide the Driver seat all the way forward.  It is a bit tall for my car so getting a wiggling baby in can be difficult.  But, she slides right in and to be honest if I have to slide her in sideways or if she has to duck climbing in a little inconvenince is worth it for the safety.  Right now she is 14 months and weighs 20.5lbs and no more than 30 inches (I hope she hasn't been measured in 2 months).  Also I can not see her but can see around the car seat just fine while driving.  The seat fabric does not make her hot like you would think it would.  The cushion is fabulous and I can tell she knows the difference between the bucket seat and this seat.  She likes being able to see outside.  Hopefully this seat lasts her rearfacing well over 2 if not hopefully something will come out with a higher height limit.As for the safety we have 2 Recaro seats in our sports car which made this purchase a breeze.  Although I would have liked to have the Sunshine Kids carseat since it is made out of steel and exp. date longer.All in all I am very happy.",5
"Fuzzi Bunz Comfort Pad Combo, White, 3 Pack","I purchased these based on the brands reputation for cloth diapering. They are very soft, incredibly absorbant and stay in place well. I did NOT care for the small- that was way too small to stay in place  and do it's job. The medium and large sizes are great and I will end up ordering more in the future! I used them on a really hot day and was wondering if it would be extra hot, but in fact I didn't even remember I was wearing one!!! I read a lot on washable pads and was skeptical but these really are nice (and it's true- NO ODOR!!!)! I wash mine with my son's cloth diapers; fairly simple to care for.",4
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",makes giving my newphews juice boxes so much easier cause they dont squeeze them and then wear them...would buy again and again. they fit everything from regular juice boxes to capri sun even the little juice boxes are safe.,5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","Bought this and the Musical Nature arch and they are so easy to switch between the twin's stollers!  And the ability to move the location of the toys and to replace them with new ones sure keeps them occupied!  Great product; thank you, Tiny Love!!",5
"Karibu Baby Cushion Step Potty, Green",This is best best toilet seat ever especially for autistic kids n especial needs kids ... So secure comfy n cute.,5
Sassy Phone Of My Own Developmental Toy,"I took my son to the store to pick out a new toy when he was 4 months old.  He immediately grabbed for this phone out of all the other toys.  Initially he was mostly enamored by the black and white and colored rings because he couldn't open it up on his own but it has been four months and it's still one of his favorites.  We give this to him in the car and it will even keep him occupied for those marathon trips to grandpa and grandma's house.  It holds up pretty well to being dropped and slobbered on.  We've only had one instance where the buttons stopped working after a particularly long fall but a few days later we heard it ringing and chirping """"Hello! Hola!"""" over in the corner - we haven't had any problems since.  It's great little toy to tie onto a baby shower gift.",4
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado","I love that I never touch my dirty diapers.Very durable, no leaks. I would certainly recommend it to others.",4
"Nuby 2 Count 2 Handle Cup with No Spill Super Spout, Colors May Vary","I couldn't understand why my nephew refused to drink out of this new cup, but liked the lousy and leaky cheapo cup he was currently using.  I just tried to drink out of it.  No-spill is right, I couldn't barely suck a drop out of this cup!  I am getting a refund from Amazon.  Since they said I can keep them, I'll stick a steak knife in the sippy top and see if I can open it up a bit.",1
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","The Moby bath spout cover is much better looking than other too-cutesy covers, but it's also very functional ... easy to install and adjust for a perfect, snug fit. The shower lift and faucet work/flow perfectly with it in place, while my little guy is protected from bumping his head.",5
Bright Starts Lots of Links- Solid Colors,"There are several different molds uses to make the rings. My little girl likes them, they can form a chain to hold toys to things.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,This cute little peacock sure keeps my little one busy. She makes it crinkle and crunch and just loves the baby mirror. I would definitely recommend this product for a developing baby.,4
"Munchkin Feeding Set, 15 Pack","This is a great set for a toddler/preschooler. The colors are vibrant and the fishy design is exciting for the kids. The cups are perfect. My only complaint is that the bowls and plates are a little on the small side. So if you're looking for a deeper bowl or ""dinner size"" plate, then you should skip this set. If you're getting it in conjunction with other plates/bowls that are bigger, then this is a perfect addition to that. Also, I love that they can go in the dishwasher & they're BPA free!",4
Mommy's Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,I have a standard Kwikset knob... I felt like the damn thing was a jigsaw puzzle and someone was taunting me from outside... It took a screwdrive to pry the damn thing off just so I could open the door to get out of my house...  I guess it's my own fault for being cheap...,1
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","My little one has been using this chair for more than 2 years now and it has held up very well.  Although it did take me more than 6 months to figure out that I could take the whole fabric part off and wash it, it did wipe down easily without removing the whole thing.  I like the fact that the chair is sturdy and allow for a variety of both height adjustments as well as set back adjustments.  Good purchase.",5
Original Sleepy Wrap Baby Carrier (Brown),"I Bought this wrap when my baby was two months old and he loves it . It relaxes him and it's comfortable enough to wear for long time periods. It's one size fits all unlike some so I can wear it , grandma can wear it , etc.  It's the best priced wrap I've seen and the company doesn't charge extra for different colors or prints. I would definitely recommend this .",5
"Ameda CustomFit Breast Flanges, M/L","I have experience with both the Ameda and Medela pumps, and I have to say that I vastly prefer the Medela flanges both in terms of size and ease of use. This Ameda set of flanges for 28.5 and 30.5 mm is very poorly designed -- in order to use the 28.5 mm flange you have to use the insert for the 30.5 mm flange. Why?! Why not just sell both sizes as standalone flanges without all this inserting nonsense?! It ends up being more parts to wash (always a pain with pumps!) and it's not easy to use. You also can't really see the milk flow easy through two layers of flange plastic.It's frustrating because if you need this size flange and you have an Ameda pump, you're stuck with this situation. But it really is a poor design. Ameda, if you're reading this: REDESIGN THESE FLANGES.",2
Eco-friendly Oeko Tex Binkie Bungee Pacifier Clip (Pink Dot) - 3 Colors Options!,"Just like the other reviewer, I bought this because it works with the Soothies pacifier (the only one my son actually liked).  I've washed and dried it several times now (because I wasn't thinking far enough ahead to buy 2), and it has stood up wonderfully.  Great quality, safe for my baby and safe for the environment.  What more could you ask for?",5
"Leachco Snoogle Mini Compact Side Sleeper, Sage/White dot","I love this pillow. I'm 6 months pregnant and I sleep quite well with this thing.  It is a bit of a gymnastic feat to roll over, but my hips are no longer sore. Yay!  My main complaint is that it curves so tightly that it is a bit too small for me, even though I'm only 5'4.  On the up side, the small size makes it easy for me to continue sharing the bed with my husband.",4
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,"This are awful.. Cheap and awful. My husband cannot take them out, but I can with my nails. My poor manicure! Safety first has ones with a push in the middle that are so much better. I threw 2 unopened boxes away. Waste of money!",1
NoJo Little Bedding  Jungle Time 4 Piece Crib Set,"I got this order very fast! I ordered at midnight friday and recieved it Monday at 5pm. That was very nice! The quality seems pretty good, I thought the Quilt was going to be a little bigger but it is nice. I hope it washes up good!",4
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"The Nosefreida Nasal Aspirator works much better for me and my baby than the traditional bulb syringes passed out to every new mother at the hospital! Get this and some saline and have a happy, no longer stuffy baby! :)",5
"Munchkin 6 Shelf Closet Organizer, Cream/Green","The three bottom openings are the right size for canvas bins or wicker baskets (neither of which are included unfortunately).  I have a basket with refill packages of wipes, another with tubes of cream, and I use the split compartment for stacking diapers so I don't have to wrangle with a package every time the changing table runs out.  I use the netted shelves at the top to store hats and shoes, perfect size.  I have no trouble with how it hangs, and the compartment floors are sturdy enough, especially if you're going to put a bin anyway.  I have another brand in a different closet, and I actually needed to put skinny hard-cover books on each shelf to compensate for the lack of support - no issues like that with the Munchkin one.  My only complaint would be that it ought to come with at least one canvas bin... but heck, then they would just charge more for the ensemble anyway.  The bins I use in it came from Babies R Us.",4
"CribWrap Crib Wrap 3PC Rail Cover Set By Trend Lab - 1- 51&quot; Front Rail Cover &amp; 2- 27&quot; Side Rail Covers &amp; Bonus Cloud B Plush Rattle, Blue Fleece","These crib rail covers are great. They are soft and thick, and a great value compared to the other covers that are available. I tied the strings in bows on the outside so my kids couldn't pull on them, and it looks a little neater too.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",I got both this pillow and the boppie pillow.  The Brest Friend is MUCH easier to use.  Baby doesn't slip off of it as easily and it provides more back support.,5
Boy/Girl Soothie Pacifier &amp; Toy Holder Clip - Pac Man,"This pacifier holder is perfect! Good quality, packaged very nicely and was received very quickly. The picture does not do it justice. I cannot wait to give this gift.",5
Dr. Brown's 2-pack 7-ounce Standard Feeding System Glass Baby Bottles,"I love these bottles..this is my second baby and the second  time we have used them.  I did decide to use glass this time and love them.  You can warm your formula or breast milk up very quickly just under running water.  You will need to learn how to use this system but once you do...its no big deal.  I also am a huge supporter of Dr. Browns because he lives in my town and I trust what he has accomplished with these bottles. I will say his old bottles went up to 8 oz on the big ones and 4 oz on the small ones (which these do not..7 and 3)  so that makes things difficult b/c of how formula is scooped out but again minimal effort involved.  Another issue is that the glass bottles leak...I figured out that after you shake your bottle and warm it under the water..just simply loosen the lid again and allow the milk to run back out of the tube and into the bottle.  Takes a second, but I have learned this does prevent the milk from dripping on your babys neck..Hope that helps people:)",5
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,"Received the pouches really fast, great quality, my toddler loves them! The zipper on top stays closed and I have not had a problem with any mess, easy to clean with a bottle brush as well.",5

GroVia DiaperRx Laundry Treatment - 20 Count,"We had been having serious smell issues with our cloth diapers--our HE washer was taking 6-7 washes and there was STILL a stink.  I have since changed detergents to a more hard water specific brand, but I first used these little packets to see if I could get the smell out.  ONE wash with an extra rinse and there is NO smell anymore!  I was seriously at my wits end--this product has saved me a ton of time and money--definitely would recommend to anyone with a build up/smell issue.  I am hopeful this has finally done it.I will update this review to say for some reason this product worked wonders the first load I used them for, but the second batch-not so much.  I have no idea why as I did nothing differently and followed the instructions exactly; I washed half of our diapers in each load.  For the steep price I am going to have move on to something else.  I am so bummed!",3
Satsuma Designs Jersey Infant Hat - Natural,I have this hat and the velour hat and blanket.  Love them all.  This hat is super soft.,5
Narrow Striped Zebra Pelt Rug,My daughter LOVES IT!! It is narrow though--make sure and measure your area first. It is very soft and fluffy!,5
"Summer Infant Swaddleme 100% Cotton Knit - 4 Pack, Jungle Fun (Large)","We swaddled our son up until he was 4 months old, and he always seemed to get his arms loose until we tried these.  They are very easy to use and kept him tight and comfortable.  The material was thin enough that I wasn't worried about him overheating.",5
BRICA Stretch-to-Fit Window Shade,"Out of the package, this sun shade looks awesome. It appears to be well crafted, with good materials. The mesh is wonderfully stretchy and strong, and the snap along the edge of it allows you to cinch it on the short side of a rear window for a better fit...great idea there. Unfortunately, like most of the reviewers here, I quickly discovered that the suction cups are total junk. I bought two shades and put them on my rear windows. Within a week, one of the shades started to fall off the window in two places. I reattached the suction cups; they held for about 30 seconds before popping off again. After reading reviews here (which I didn't do before buying; lesson learned!), I looked closer at the suction cups - sure enough, I saw a hairline crack on the underside of each one, rendering them incapable of holding suction. They have never worked again. Within three weeks of installation the other shade did the exact same thing. Wish they'd address the design of the suction cups, because this could be a great product...but as is, they're total junk and a complete waste of money.",1
Bumkins Supersized Superbib - Fire Engine,my wife loves these bibs. They are easy to take care and can be thrown into the wash. we like them so much we bought an extra for granny's house.,5
"Newco International Kids Bean Bag, Soccer","If you have a toddler who likes bean bag chairs, this one is durable and washable.  A great gift for those toddlers who like to run and jump.....they can jump on this and avoid the furniture and getting hurt.",4
Lamaze Logan the Lion Play and Grow,"I bought this for my 5 month old because he loved Freddie the Firefly but had already had Freddie for 3 months so I thought it was time for something new. For some reason he just doesn't seem interested in this toy. It makes a """"roar"""" when you tip him. He likes to put the hands into his mouth but the teething toys are attached to it so he just seems frustrated by it. Lamaze has great toys but this one was not a winner with my little guy. He has had Freddie since birth and still prefers it to Logan. Go figure.",3
Trend Lab Paisley Park 4 Piece Crib Set,"It went perfect with the stencil set we had.  This was the only bedding set we found that matched.  I like that the bumper pieces have several ties to tie to the crib.  We haven't got to test it out yet since baby hasn't arrived, but the sheet fits very snug on our mattress.  We are very pleased with this purchase.",5
Boppy Contoured Pregnancy Wedge,Very supportive with a firm foam and great for even early in your pregnancy has a nice contour to it as well,5
Sesame Street Framed Friends Green Folding Travel Potty Seat,Love it I take it everywhere. No more holding my kids up on the toilet in public restrooms. Go ahead and buy it!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Rusty the Robot Take Along Toy,"I bought this before my baby was born, I was surprised how big it was, it was almost the size of the baby!!! It's about 10"" long, so better for bigger babies. I've been showing it to my baby since he was born, but it's only now he's turned 3 months that he's noticed it. He likes to grab it by the arms. The little mirror attracts him, as do the faces of the robot. It's very well-made, with bright colors and different textures. I think this will become one of his favourites..",5
Graco SnugRider Elite Stroller &amp; Car Seat Carrier,"This 'mini' stroller reminds me of our 'old' stroller.  It is very lightweight and is easy to maneuver, which is why we purchased it.  The new 'travel system' is so much bigger and is too much for a little newborn.  Yes, it was another purchase and we weren't happy about that - would have preferred the 'old' stroller back...because it was both in one...but",5
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Soft Activity Book,"We received this as a gift and it is definitely cute. Our twins are still itty bitty, but they like the mirror and the crinkly noises one of the pages makes. I can see this easily growing with them.",4
Blowout Blocker Diaper Extension - Prevent Diaper Blowouts (Blue),It wasn't listed on amazon that this is really just up to 9 month size so luckily my 15 month old is on the smaller side so this still works for her. We use it as an extender for her overnight diaper and so far so good.Probably won't be able to use it much longer.,4

"GroVia Cloth Wipes, 12 count","We bought these to use as reusable diaper wipes, and do use them as such, but I find they make better washcloths. I don't find that we need such a substantial wipe for diaper changes, and these both take up more space in the warmer and use up more solution than the thinner ones we have (OsoCozy and another similar we received as a gift).",4

"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I felt a little trapped into buying these since there are not that many BPA free options.  I quickly figured out that they leak really badly unless you buy the inserts.  Bottles that leak are miserable as the last thing you want to be doing- while exhausted at 3:00 am is dealing with leaky bottles.  Gets all over the baby and then you have to change them, waking everyone up more.... miserable.  They worked fine for me after I figured that out but that is not acceptable for such an expensive bottle.  I also am annoyed to have to clean the extra parts for absolutely no extra benefit.  Very dissappointed.  I used Avent bottles for my first and if they had a BPA free option I would do that first.  Maybe they will soon!",2

Nature's Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"I bought this calender for myself for my second son. It is very colorful and has room on each page to write height, weight, and what baby likes to do. There is also room on each page for a photo to be placed. The calender date boxes have room for a sticker and some fine writing. My only complaint is that it does not have as many stickers as I would like, but I just put asterisks before whatever special event happened that day. I bought one for a friend as she found it very useful as well.",4
"Baby Buddy Bib Clip, Pink","It's a very neat idea, and it works. But, it's very cheaply made. The strap is only a red ribbon glued onto the clips. I expected it to be a sturdier strap and fastened better to the clips. I don't foresee it lasting very long, especially when baby can get a hold of it and starts handling it.",4
OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack (White),I have four different kinds of cloth baby wipes and these are my favorites. The texture is good enough to get the job done but they're not too thick or heavy to be cumbersome. I find myself reaching for these wipes first every time.,5
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"I am very happy with this monitor. It works pretty well for me. I love the video, it is very clear and the sounds is as good.",5
"MamaDoo Kids Foldable Play Yard Mattress Topper, Blue","Right around the time my daughter outgrew the bassinet insert for her playard, I realized that she didn't seem comfortable on the hard mattress anymore.  In the meantime, we were about to take our first family vacation, and I was worried about her being able to sleep on that hard bottom.  I found the Mamadoo mattress after a lot of searching online, and I'm glad I did.  First, I really appreciate that it's made with non-toxic materials, since foam pads can tend to be a little questionable sometimes.  Second, the fact that it can fold is GREAT - it goes together perfectly in the bottom of the playard, and you'd never be able to tell that it's split into three sections, but it sure is a lot easier to move.  Our last vacation was a car trip, but our next is flying cross-country, and it's nice to know that packing the mattress won't be that big a deal.Getting the foam pieces out of their canvas covers isn't *that* easy - I got a thin waterproof mat that I put on top of the mattress under the sheet, though, so hopefully I won't have to take them out very often.  On the other hand, it's not terribly difficult - just wouldn't want to do it every day.We do use the mattress every single day - we keep it in the bottom of her playard for her to sit and stand on while she plays (it's firm enough that she can stand on it pretty well), and it's comfortable enough for her to nap in the playard when we take her toys out.I only wish that it were a *little* less expensive, because I'd get a second one for her cross-country grandmother's house (as convenient as it is to travel with, it's always nicer to take less with you when you fly).  It's certainly worth the price to feel confident that she's sleeping on something safe.  (And, as the subject line says, there was never any odor to it at all.)",5
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!","Light weight swaddle but also works nicely as a blanket in car seat or to drape over car seat handle for sun, wind or cold protection before the heavier cover is needed.  Makes a great light weight blanket for a toddler as well.",5
Chicco Hippo Hookon High Chair - Nature,"We wanted something other than a bulky highchair for our daughter to sit at while eating at the table.  Very easy to put together, durable, very easy to remove and replace.",5
"Evenflo Triumph LX Convertible Car Seat, Median","After researching car seat ratings in Consumer Reports I thought I had found a winner; great rating, great price. I was greatly disappointed! The car seat was difficult to install rear-facing, fasteners seemed flimsy, and the seat did not recline enough to allow my child to nap comfortably without having her head fall forward. Needless to say, the seat was returned.",1
Graco DuoGlider LX Stroller in Fortune,should have gotten a jogging stroller instead.  this thing is huge. i would run into everything. save your money and get a joggind stroller,2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Sea Turtle","My wife and I bought this for the nursery of our 6-month old.  The blue and green stars that it projects on to the ceiling gives our baby something to look at as he falls asleep.  It runs entirely on batteries, so moving it isn't a hastle at all.  The timer is also nice.  I think if we buy another star projector type toy, I'd like the stars to move to keep him occupied even more until he falls asleep.Overall, it's a great addition to our nursery.",5
"phil&amp;teds Poppy Highchair, Bubblegum","I received the Poppy from Phil & Ted's as a gift from my mother in law (I had asked for it ;) ).  We needed a new high chair for my son (8 months) since our old high chair was downright nasty and had broken (it was a hand me down from his sisters).  Let me just say that I LOVE this high chair.  I wish I had one of these things sooner.  The seat is so comfortable and easy to clean.  Such an improvement on the old cloth covered seats of years past.  The tray is also something to love about it. It is super easy to clean, with no extra nooks and crannies (cup holders? Why do some have cup holders?).  Plus, the tray is dishwasher safe for those days when your child is unmerciful with their food art.One of the main reasons I wanted this high chair, aside from the above mentioned items, was how it can be broken down.  When not in use, I take off the two back legs and lean it up in my broom closet and it's out of my way.  We often travel with my inlaws to their beach home and you can even break it down to basically the size of the seat (after removing all of the legs).  How's that for easy travel!  It barely takes up any room in the car.  That is super convenient.  We also bring it along to Grandma and Grandpa's house.  They don't have to worry about having one at their home for us to use, we just bring it along!I would absolutely recommend this chair to everyone.  Well worth the money.",5
"Neat Solutions Disposable Bib, Princess, 10-Count",These work great to throw in a purse or diaper bag. The bib has a catch pocket on it to prevent food falling all the way to the ground...which I hated when we were out.,5
"Sunshine Kids Grip It Car Seat Gripper, Gray","i was dangerously mislead, it's actually NOT safe to use these :( to remedy this issue i took the bottom part (on the seat) folded it up behind the other part and duct taped it.  nothing is suppose to go between your carseat and the actual seat.",1
Sweet Pea Wet Bag (Baby Pink),"After only using this wet bag in our diaper bag for a few months, the zipper stopped working (when you zip it now, the zipper travels from one end of the track to the other without actually zipping it closed). Even if that hadn't happened, I probably still wouldn't recommend this bag as it is VERY thin - it kept smells in fine, but anything that was actually wet would end up soaking through. Go with Planet Wise instead.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I thought it was really good toy and bought it. Cheap tires, horrible chemical smell. Such toys in China cost less than $1. Do not poison your children this crap.",1

Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"Our 8-month old twin boys absolutely love this walker!  They've used it constantly since we bought one for them to try out.  They love being able to get around themselves without needing adult assistance.  They chase the dogs and us around the kitchen, family room, anywhere they can get the walker to go!  Unfortunately, our twins' pediatric occupational therapist says we should limit their use of this type of walker.  Apparently the way the seat positions them, it promotes toe-walking and makes it more difficult for babies to learn to walk properly.  This was confirmed by a friend who's 1-yr old nephew used this since he was 6-months old and now walks on his toes all the time.  We'll continue using it since the boys enjoy it so much, but we will be limiting the amount of time they stay in it.",4
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Papagayo Mini Crib Set, Green","We had limited space so we needed a mini crib. This sheet set is great! There aren't many options for mini crib bedding, but this will not disappoint.",5
Infantino Activity Triangle,My daughter was pleased for her 7 month old daughter to receive this for her 1st Christmas.  It turned out to be an excellent choice.,5
"Leachco Easy Teether XL Convertible Crib Rail Cover, Ivory","This product just plain works. My baby was chomping on his crib, now he doesn't. It's that simple. I got all 3 rail covers.",5
Belly Fish Nursing Cover and Pillow (Fall Leaves - Green),Much less expensive version of the travel Boppy! It was awesome for discreet nursing on the plane or in restaurants... Folds up nicely! Awesome purchase!,4
"Rumparooz Cloth Diaper Cover, White Aplix, Newborn","So I have nothing bad about the product, it works great. I usually use it 3 times before discarding (put in 3 inserts)The color is nice and true to the one in the picture.It is really convenient to open and close, as normal disposable diapers. The only set back is if you forget to put the Velcro in the wash position before putting in the pail, cause then when you wash it will stick to other stuff in the wash.I totally recommend the product.",5
"Carters Easy Fit Sateen Crib Fitted Sheet, Ecru",The sheet itself is great. And I got the chocolate to match the bedroom (I'm a grandmother and the crib is in the guest room). Anyway I wouldn't recommend chocolate for crib sheets. My granddaughter had a snotty nose. Well the sheets needed changed after every nap. She would rub her little face during her nap and that brown sheet looked a mess after every 30 minute nap. I just didn't think that through when ordering. The sheet is great though. Quality. Softness. Durability. All good. Just don't get it in brown.,4
"Kushies Deluxe Flannel Change Pad, Yellow with Brown Dots","Great for changing--soft for my kiddo but effectively waterproof, too.  Because it's bigger than some other pads, we use it for more than just the changing table.  We put it under our 2-month-old when we lay her on the couch or give her a break from her diaper.  It's also thin enough that it folds well into our tiny diaper bag.  You can wash it and toss it in the dryer.  We even ordered a second one.",5
"Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake, Year-Round","I've got two daughters that we've used these for grandma and I've used them at home too. It works pretty well overall. I can't seem to make salt dough to save my life, so these being a premade mix is great. The &#34;rolling pin&#34; really sucks tho - it needs to be at least two inches wider. When you wet your childs hand tho, we just put their hands under the running faucet, shook their hand to get excess water off, and pressed it into the mold and had no problems with their hands sticking. I think it does take longer than two days to dry tho, and we flipped it over and let the back dry for an extra day too. We'll probably paint the actual handprints so they're easier to see, since when direct sunlight is on them, you can barely see the print.",4
"Maxi-Cosi Priori Convertible Car Seat, Gipsy","This is the best convertible car seat ever!  Very comfortable and extremely easy to set up...just follow the manual, which also is available on the company's website on PDF (for the tech pepople).  We also bought a Britax and returned it because it did not recline and was very stiff and uncomfortable.  This is forward and backward facing, reclines etc!  The first time we opened the box and took out the carseat, our daughter sat in it after we removed the wrapping on the kitchen floor and refused to leave her ""chair"" that night, and fell asleep in it.  We are Maxi Cosi buyers and decide to give something else a try and it did not work!  We are back to the Maxi Cosi brand because Dorel makes the best products for babies and kids period.  We bought the infant seat and the Quinny and we are not regretful, besides the colors are great and the side protection is a safety feature that is necessary!  Excellent purchase, the only drawback is that the toddler seat does not snap into the quinny...kidding! Yes, she is growing up...sigh!",5
"OsoCozy Chinese Prefold Diapers, Infant 4x6x4","We bought these as pads to help minimize our need to wash the changing table cover.  I cannot imagine using them, given how much they shrink, as diapers, but we do not use per-folds, so I'll leave that evaluation to others.  As quick and easy pads for changing they work fine.",5
Philips AVENT Isis iQ Duo Twin Electronic Breast Pump,"This product was the first exposure to Avent we have had. We called Avent because we noticed a problem with our product. It did not have the small plastic connector that comes on EVERY Duo. We could not provide a receipt. The ""lady"" told us (very rudely) that they don't service products that are used and would not believe us that we had purchased the product new. We most definitely did buy it new. It should not matter where a product is purchased, support and warranty service for the product should be a part of the company. After trying many ways to get a resolution to the matter, I asked for a supervisor. The ""lady"" informed me that there was no one higher than her and there was nothing she or the company could do to rectify the defective part (it just simply wasn't there, on the end of the hose). If you are looking for a company that cares about its users and has great customer service. Don't look at Avent. Great product. They just don't care about you. Or your problem.Too bad.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Amazing..I don't write reviews but this product deserves one. My daughter is three years old and with Ladybug at night time she doesn't feel alone anymore. She sleeps now in her own room. It has a timer and nice colors. I definitely recommend it.,5
"Safety 1st Deluxe Press Fit Outlet Plugs, 8-Count","I live in a 45 year old house with mostly original outlets. These are the traditional style grounded outlet as shown in the product's description. In these outlets, the product's hook can't engage properly and lock the protector to the outlet. The product simply pulls straight out like the cheaper non-locking protectors.A few outlets in this house have been recently replaced. They are the same style but apparently built slightly differently. In these, the product locks very securely to the outlet and can only be removed with considerable effort. I doubt a toddler would have the strength to remove them even if they knew the proper procedure to unlock them.If you want the safest solution and are even slightly handy with a screwdriver, consider replacing your outlets with tamper resistant ones. They only cost about $1 at your local home improvement store. Warning: If your house was built around 1970 you may have aluminum wiring so consult a licensed electrician instead of messing with it yourself.",3
Munchkin Two White Hot Cling Shades,"They worked for me. I brought these last summer after I went to Wal-Mart and they were completely out of the girlie and cute shades I originally wanted.  They were supposed to be up temporary until my ordered shades arrived.I cleaned the entire back window(s) with alcohol and applied the shade. I will admit it was tricky applying the shade void of air bubbles.  It wasn't impossible, got them up and the shades stayed up all summer long.  After the time and energy I used to install them there was no way I was going to take them down.Indeed there are better looking shades on the market.  But you get what you pay for.  They kept the sun away from my daughter (my daughter's car seat is station in the middle).  This summer I finally installed the ordered shades. They were easier to install and look better but more expensive.Would i recommend this product? it depends on your price point.",4
"Kolcraft Cozy Soft Portable Crib Mattress, Lily","It's harder than it seems to find a replacement pad/mattress for a standard Pack and Play. This is the perfect size. It's softer and thicker than the mat that came with the Pack & Play, so be sure that's what you want. But it fits perfectly, and it's exactly what we needed at a very reasonable price.",5
Medela 150 Ml Storage Bottle Case of 10 BPA FREE,Buying these at the store would've cost over three times as much. I'm ordering some for my friend who recently had a baby as well. You can never have too many of them.,5
"Thirsties Duo Diaper, White, Size One (6-18 lbs)","After reading such good reviews I decided to purchase these to use when we are out and about because I figured they would be easier to use than prefold with a cover. To my suprise I was wrong.Cons:1 Almost every time I have used these they have leaked both pee and poo2)They always seem to be lumpy no matter how long I spend trying to straighten out the inserts3) The hemp inserts take FOREVER to dry in the dryerPros:1) They come in cute colors (but so do the regular covers)2) They are relatively simple to use as it is all in one piece when you put in on and take it offOverall, I will not be purchasing them again because the ease of use does not outweigh the many cons. Yes you may save a minute or two putting these on and off compared to using prefolds and a cover, but then you waste even more time than you save having to change baby's clothes when the pee and poo leak through. I recommend using Thirsties duo wraps with either prefolds or Thirsties fab fitted diapers!",3
Earlyears Lil Shopper Play Set,"I was searching for something for my niece who was turning 1, and I was NOT disappointed!! This little set is absolutely adorable, creative, and it certainly draws in the curiosity of the little ones =)  All of the little groceries make different noises (none are obnoxious or overbearing!!), and the little grocery bag they come in is soft and durable! I can't wait to have kids of my own to buy this product again!!",5
"Cosco Flat-Fold High Chair, Zambia",Excellent product comfy for baby lots of room to play and eat at the same time safe with a lil seat belt.,5
"Badger Basket Natural Hooded Moses Basket, Sage Dot Bedding","It's not a bad basket but the sides are not as sturdy in the photo. Not much support on the sides, they are more of a 45 degree angle.",3
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","I am very pleased with this product.  My 2 year-old daughter loves this car seat.  We had a little trouble adjusting the recline.  If she is sitting too upright when she is sleeping her head leans forward, but by adjusting the recline we were able to fix the problem.",5
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,"Ignore the crazy people with a poor review on this because of the quality of this dresser. Of course it's not the nicest, most fancy well built dresser ever made, but for the money it is a very nice dresser. It is exactly what I expected. The finish is very nice, but be careful with it because it can scratch easy. Yes the wood is particle board and pine but what would you expect for the price. The drawers open & close with ease and it all went together fairly easily. Great bang for your buck.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bath and Changing Caddy,This bath caddy is WONDERFUL!!! It is so nice to grab one bag with one hand and the baby in the other to the bathroom. It is very convenient and stores everything in a way that is so easy to hold onto the baby in one hand and grab what you need for each step of the bath with the other without letting go of the baby. Bathing would be such a pain without it! I love it!,5
EIO Glass Kids Cup (8oz) (Orange),It is a nice little glass cup but the lid leaks when you try to drink with it on. So we end up not using the lid which makes this an expense glass cup.  However the silicone cover does make the cup easier to hold.  But if you want a glass cup with a lid I would keep looking cause I wouldn't buy this one again.,3
Ginsey Dora Folding Travel Potty Seat,great for putting in a diaper bag or leaving at a family member's house (or other parent's). easy to clean and very durable.,5
"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear",Perfect item. Our babe just started on purees. We put a cube of frozen puree in this & set it in the fridge overnight. It's the perfect size for 1-2 cubes. I can see these really coming in handy when we travel. We haven't had any leaks & they are a breeze to wash.,5
"Fisher-Price Precious Planet Portable High Chair Cover, Blue","Easy to use.Easy to fold.Fits on most highchairs.Love the toy connections (although we use Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy to make the connection longer).Keeps me from having to sanitize everything and let's face it, some highchairs need more than just a wipe down, they are pretty gross.",5
"NUK Learner Cup Silicone Bundle Pack, Girl, 5 Ounce, 2 Count","I bought these for my 5 month old daughter. She took to them right away and the handles are the perfect size for her little hands. We started with small amounts of water for her and now she drinks her formula from them. She loves drinking from these cups and likes to bite on the spout. I love that they are very easy clean, dishwasher safe, and bpa free. I also love the cute designs on the cups, we have the pink hot air balloon and Hello Kitty.  I wish NUK would sell these handle cups in 6-8oz sizes.",5
"Bright Starts Start Your Senses Safari Activity Gym, Spots and Stripes",This is a the best activity gym I have found!  The little tiger on it is removable and you can attach it to a carseat.  My son LOVES it.  He has been using it since about 2 months and he likes the music and LOVES the flashing lights!  I did get mine at Babies R Us for $59 and not $92 though.  But this is a fantastic product!,5
Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Wipes Refill 350ct.,"I really like the thought of the free and clear wipes. They do wipe well, but the are dryer than what I'm use to. I use twice as many of these than I do of other brands. But I have found in a few other brands, the free and clears are a tad dry. Other than that, they are a good wipe. They don't irritate or have a strong scent (because, let's be honest, you don't want to smell too much when cleaning a dirty diaper). I am normally a huge Seventh Generation fan, but these aren't my favorite!",3
Samsung SNH-1010N SmartCam WiFi Video Baby Monitor,I purchased this video monitor for my newborn baby and the product never even boot upit is a shame that in this day and age Samsung still placing garbage in the store shelf's of the world now I have to make a trip back to Target and get my $149.00 back.,1
"Sip and Smile Spill Proof Cup 2 Handle Cup Design, 7 Ounce, 2 Pack, Colors May Vary","This is our go-to sippy cup. We've never ever had it leak on us so despite its flaws, that is most important in my book! The flaws- the spout doesn't line up in between the handles when it is tightened. It's all crooked. It's very hard to get it open again too. I think the rings are getting stripped is why.",3
"Abiie Beyond Junior Y High Chair, Natural","Let me start with the positives.  I love the fact that this high chair uses minimal plastic.  I'm really trying to cut down on the amount of plastic we have in our household, and I think a non-plastic high chair is much more appealing not only from an environmentally conscious standpoint, but from an aesthetic standpoint.  I also like the fact that this chair can be used for many years to come, something very few infant products can claim.  It can grow with our son and be a piece of furniture he remembers for years.  It is relatively easy to clean.  The tray is small enough that it fits in our (large) dish drainer easily.  The seat pads and harness straps (except for the crotch strap) are easily removed for cleaning (just soaking in a tub full of warm soapy water and hanging to dry).What needs work:  White chair pads on a high chair?  Really?  Granted, they haven't become stained yet, even after about 3 months of use, but I seriously wish they offered more variety of colors for the chair pads.  Also, the crotch strap is not easily removed for cleaning, although admittedly this is the strap that probably gets the least dirty.The biggest problem we're experiencing with this chair is that the finish is flaking off, especially on the tray, where the plastic overlay affixes and is removed.  We haven't noticed any flakes coming off and we really aren't worried our child is ingesting them, but it's obviously happening, because there are strips / patches all over the tray and the tray posts.  I worry this will start to be more of an issue as time goes on given how often we wipe this chair down with a moist cloth.  Will the wood start to splinter or warp because of that?  This really shouldn't be happening to a piece of furniture that is supposed to last a long time.  It just seems shoddy.So, in summary, since non-plastic items and longevity are important to us, this high chair fits the bill in those ways.  Some design features need refining, though, to make this an outstanding product.",3
Cloud b Lavender Lab with Scented Lavender Sleep Aid,"This stuffed animal is very cute and soft, plus I like that it has a lavender scent that isn't too strong (you actually have to put your face up to it to smell this). I got it for my 8 month old son, but I will wait to give it to him since it's bigger than I thought. I just put it in his crib when he's awake or not in there so the scent can transfer to his crib, then remove it for bedtime. The fur material is nice and doesn't ""shed"" like some other stuffed animals out there even when my son pulls on it or tries to put it in his mouth. I recommend this, but for older kids like maybe at least 2 or 3 yrs old. For now, I'm the one cuddling w/ it at night:)",4
"Summer Infant Lil' Loo Potty, Pink","This potty is great!  My 2-1/2 year old son peed in it within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box!  He still goes in it all the time and the shield tall enough that pee doesn't stream out.  He has yet to poop in it though.My only complaint is that there was a lot of tape and a huge sticker on it that was really hard to get off and it left residue behind.It's super easy to clean and very light and portable.I even got my 4 month old son to poop and pee in it!  If any of you parents practice elimination communication(EC), this potty works great because of the back rest.  Or you can take the middle part out and rest your baby in front of you while the bowl is between your legs.",5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","- My back is NOT the best, Moby wrap is very comfortable to wear as long as you spread out the wide fabric it distributes the weight.- Washes and dry's easily!!!-Also for me I thought the bag would be useless as in ""I'll never get this back in there"" turns out you can stuff it back in that bag no problem! (FYI:Still would take up 1/2 your diaper bag)-I did nurse in the moby wrap, as long as you are against a wall on one side (great for plane if your by window) your totally covered on 1 side at a time. downside is I could only get the hang of nursing with it on my right side(right handed) and was really hard for me on the other side. but still, better than nothing.WHEN to Wear it:- I mostly used when I had to get things done and baby was bored, etc. needed to be held. Until front facing I could really do EVERYTHING I need to at home with a happy baby!-On outings when I didn't need to schlep around a stroller. Plus #1 your husband or anyone can fit it so you can always switch off. Plus #2 the different holds DO-NOT require re-wrapping so you simply reposition the baby for your comfort or his/hers.-Have used up to 1 1/2 so far so good.Cons:- Takes too long to put on and take off for me, i often didn't use it b/c I didn't was lazy to wrap it.- The fabric is so long it drags on the floor as you put it on.- So much fabric, bulky, can't put in diaper bag unless you have almost nothing else in there. Although I can't imagine a Bjorn or any other carrier fitting in a diaper bag so comparatively I don't thin this even counts against it.",5
Evenflo Exersaucer Smartsteps Jump &amp; Go,"I purchased two of these Jump N Go's for my twin sons, when they were about 6 months old... and I HATE them!First of all we bought them since its easier to move the jumpers from room to room than the exersaucer's. I also knew my sons LOVED jumping, and the Jump and Go seemed to be fitted with the most toys. There is actually only one toy, but it plays music, and seemed to be the most entertaining of all of the jumpers.I have to admit, the assembly was horrible! Well, one of them went together no problem, but the other one just wouldnt click! It was completely ridiculous, so we wound up exchanging it for another, which was easily assembled while we were in BRU... This is obviously not a huge problem, but it may happen to someone! Attaching them to the doorframe was also easy, and they seemed very sturdy. I put my sons in them for about 3 minutes, (in a doorway measuring about 12 ft across!) before I decided they were unsafe!(1)  It seemed like when the boys would jump maybe 4 times in a row, that the clip that holds it over the molding would start slipping out of place! I began to hold the jumpers still when this happened, and watch the clip ""slip"" back into place, this is certainly not safe!(2)  The boys were banging against the doorframe really hard! I know that they were both in a jumper in one doorway, but it was basically the same room they would have if it was one child in one average sized doorframe. They would also look up at the cross above their heads, causing the jumper to sway over to the doorway and crush their fingers, and bang their heads!(3)  The jumper didnt ""jump"" right. I believe its for the reason described in a previous review, its built ""backwards"". When we later purchased the bumper jumper, the twins were fine, and used a lot less energy to jump in them!(4)  They happened to be wearing white onsies, and they were wet with baby drool... The onsies turned BLUE, which came right off of the dye on the seat! I wasn't sure how dangerous this was, or what would happen to the twins if they ingested the stuff, but obviously it wouldn't be washable either!(5)  The seat was also oddly designed. Instead of ""propping them up"" in a standing position, it sort of set them up with their legs sticking outward... This seemed very awkward, and the boys were leaning forward the entire time, I guess to achieve the correct placement to jump? I know that babies lean foward in most jumpers, but I KNOW that they are supposed to be supported into a standing position, not held in a ""sitting"" position, anyway this was never a problem with the Graco!(6)  The spring was VERY noisy! At first I didnt purchase these to keep the noise level down, but since the saucers have music (not too loud, but music none the less) I now know its better to have something like this WITHOUT music and sounds... I actually wouldn't have cared, but the music is about 10 x noisier than that of my saucers! No WAY you could watch television with your baby jumping in this apparatus. It was also the kind of noise that worries me, like it sounds as if its malfunctioning, which is very odd since the Jump and Go isn't mechanical at all!I was quick to return the jumpers, came home with two new Gracos, and am very satisfied... MUCH better quality, and we just add on our own toys (especially since they provide you with the ""links"" to attach toys to).. I would stay away from this jumper, its not good at all!",1
Natural Comfort Double Electric or Battery Breast Pump,"I purchased this pump when my son was 5 days old.  I didn't return to work until he was over three months old.  As a result, I was beyond the company's return-by date.  I used the product for approximatly one month before the suction on both sides went out.  I did some research and decided to go with the more expensive Pump in Style, which, I might add, I have been extremely pleased with.  After contacting the company, they advised me that I would not be able to get my money back, and would only be able to get a replacement pump instead.  I was highly disappointed with the performance of this product, and will be staying away from this company's products in the future.",1

"NUK Silicone Wildlife 2 Pack BPA Free Pacifier, Size 1, Colors May Vary","I had not initially planned on using pacifiers as I was worried that they would create nipple confusion and interfere with my ability to breastfeed. Like a lot of sleep deprived first-time mothers, I caved pretty quickly to their magical ability to calm my angry infant.We had a Soothie from the hospital but my daughter stopped taking it pretty quickly. I picked up my first pack of NUK Pacifiers because they claimed not to interfere with breastfeeding. They have lived up to every expectation. My daughter has been using these pacifiers since she was 3 days old, we have had absolutely no problems with nipple confusion and she loves them.You can't pick the color/style you want when you order from Amazon, and as another reviewer stated you will inevitably get the style you didn't want.

Baby Einstein Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym,"Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Ocean Adventure GymBaby Einstein Baby Neptune Ocean Adventure GymWe received this mat as a gift for our 2 month old and it's definitely been the toy that's captivated him the most thus far.Pros: He really likes the mirror and it is easy to position the dangling toys so that he can hit and kick them, which causes him (and us) endless amusement :) The mat feels nice and there is a lot to entertain him.Cons: I laundered the mat per instructions after our son was sick on it. It cleaned up fine, but came out of the washer covered in what looks like tiny pieces of tissue, which could possibly be a choking hazard. I've only had to wash it once so far, so I don't know if that happens every time, but it was a pain to clean it up before leaving it to dry. Also, the electronic toy is not my favourite - the flashing lights are fast and erratic and after getting down to my son's level and looking at it from the same distance as he was, I ended up switching it off because it just seemed like way too much stimulation; there was no pattern to the lights and they were sooo much faster than the music it just didn't seem like a good idea to have that happening 6' from my sons eyes.So in conclusion, using it without the electronic toy, it's a great product. Lots to see and play with and most importantly, my son likes it. As a gift, I'm happy with it. If we'd paid $[...] for it, I'd probably return it and get a mat with a different lights/sound component.",3

Fisher Price Soothing Massage Bouncer,"When my son was four months old, the back of the bouncer flipped foward and he fell face first on the carpet.

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This is a great chair once baby is able to sit up, it doesn't recline at all so I don't recommend it for babies who aren't sitting yet.This booster is exactly what I was looking for to save space in my eat-in kitchen and to have for outings to restaurants since I'm not a fan of those wood high chairs most places have with the broken seat belts.  This booster folds into a nice compact square for transporting.  The chair secures to most common dining chairs (not ideal for booths).  There is also the option of raising or lower the legs beneath to help get the right height for the table so baby is part of the family.  You can adjust it so baby is sitting right up to the table with no trays at all just using the lap belt but our baby likes to kick and I bet he could kick against the table and knock the whole chair over if he tried so we don't use it that way, when he is older we will most likely use it in this manner as more of a traditional booster.The three trays you see in the pictures really are nice.  The white tray insert fits snuggly and can be removed and placed right into the dishwasher so I use it with the insert most of the time.  The blue tray is harder to fit in the dishwasher but is great for cheerios or playing with toys especially when I am trying to cook and the baby really wants to be able to see me, I just pop him in and place some cheerios on the tray and he keeps himself entertained trying to get them. The green tray cover is great for keeping trays sterile while transporting the chair to a restaurant when eating out and for keeping the mess contained on the way home so you don't end up with sweet potatoes all over your car.A final bonus of this chair is that there are no real nooks for food to sneak into.  This is a hard plastic without a lot of seams allowing for easy clean up with a damp cloth.",5

"Stork Craft Beatrice 5 Drawer Chest, White","We purchased this dresser in natural because we needed something larger that would also match our daughters toddler bed.  I regret buying this product for so many reasons.  Obiously, we knew it wouldn't be perfect at such a cheap price, but I still think for $200+ it should have some quality.  The instructions were horrible, although my husband was able to get this together without too many issues.  The bolts and screws are awful and DO NOT hold well at all.  After a few months of use, they just starting falling out, with the dresser drawers barely hanging on.  The drawers are very, very shallow and small, so this is really only ideal for a small child for a small period of time.  Clothes obviously get bigger as the child grows, so unless they have very few garments, this would not work.  My almost 4 year old is wearing a 4T and the drawers are so small that I have to end up hanging most everything in her closet.  As I said before, we didn't purchase this dresser with the hopes of it lasting forever, but I think just a few months is ridiculous.  We are constantly having to tighten the bolts and fix the drawers.  I would never recommend this product!!!",1

Chariot 2011 Cabriolet Bicycle Trailer **CLOSEOUT**,"We were looking for a bike trailer.  JUST a bike trailer.  We wanted something that was comfy for the kids with room to grow, something that would hold up well and resell well.  In the world of Chariots, the Cougar seems to be the one that is sought out.  I personally did not care for the Cougar for a few reasons - the cost, the bike arm not being included (seriously how many people buy a Chariot and do NOT use it as a bike trailer?), the lack of storage (you can't really put heavy stuff in the pouch), and the name.  Seriously.  Cougar?  OK that's a dumb reason but I am not a Cougar and I would feel icky owning a stroller called the Cougar.I understand that you can change your trailer into a stroller but I don't know why you would want to.  Even if I had started this adventure with my first child, I am not sure that the multi-use features would appeal to me.  I am now on my 4th child, and I have strollers I like very much.  I can't see a bike trailer ever really filling the niche of stroller for me.  It lacks recline, it lacks a good sun shade, it just wouldn't be my thing.  I can see some appeal to using the trailer to cross country ski, if that's your thing.  The hiking feature is really flat out strange to me - why not just use a frame carrier? - but if that's your thing, great.  The reason I am pointing all these things out is, if you DO want to do some of these things - the stroller thing especially - this is really probably not the trailer for you because it does not have a parking break.  I can't fathom a stroller with no parking break.  But as I said, we wanted a bike trailer.  So for us that does not matter.First, the things I like about this trailer.  It is well constructed.  It has some room in back for storage - it would be nice if there was more, but you can fit two gallon jugs of water and a fair bit more of soft stuff, clothes, food, whatever.  The Chariot website gives this trailer a crazy tiny amount of headroom - 23 inches? - but my more or less average 3 1/2 year old twins fit inside with room to grow and I do expect this to hold two 5 year olds.  (Not with helmets but I think we are going to be in the no helmets in the trailer camp - we're not planning this for commuting or anywhere a colision is likely to occur)  It is wide enough that the kids are quite comfortable.  The seat is nicely padded and comfortable for the kids - I have had a number of kids of various ages, including my 8yo son, get in to give me an opinion (yes, oddly, he fits).  There is lots of leg room.  The pouches for the kids are placed so they are out of the child's space while sitting, but easily reached (ie in the foot area not the lap area).  The harnesses are easy to adjust and easy to use, comfortable and secure for the child (a U-shaped harness drops over the child, so you won't have that wiggle one arm thing out happening).  It folds fairly easily and doesn't take up much space with the wheels off.  It is light (24 pounds vs. 28ish for the Cougar 2 or Burley D'lite).  The arm attaches to the bike with a ball and socket mechanism which gives the trailer freedom of movement while still allowing it to follow the bike and pull very easily.  The price is low, for a quality trailer.  In so many ways, it's an awesome little trailer.Now for the bad.  The screen that covers the front is sort of a shower cap design with elastic edges.  It looks sloppy and if your kids are like mine you know they will be shoving their hands out, pulling the cover aside.  Elastic wears out over time, and I would prefer a more snug, tailored edge to the cover for that reason.  It connects to the bottom using plastic buckles which require two hands to operate.  The rain part merely rolls down and velcros across the bottom, and the whole affair really just looks sloppy.  On the plus side, it is easily removed should you wish to forgo it.  (I think all the Chariots have this sloppy elastic edged cover thing going on, but the cross country line attaches with a more one-handed function) The trunk or storage space is, as mentioned, small (better than the Cougar but not as big as a Burley) and is partly taken up by the metal frame that serves as the folding mechanism.  The top of the trailer is open (or see through) which seems great on a day that is not too sunny, for the kids to see up and out, but not great if you want to keep your little ones out of the sun.  The back flap lifts up and over to serve as a sun shade but it is a very half-rear-ended measure.  It does not come with a safety flag and has only one reflector which might be enough but it makes it look unfinished, like it is missing something.  There are two holes for reflectors, but only one reflector.  And finally, it has no handlebar.  Even if you don't wish to use this for a stroller, a handlebar would make it SO much easier to move around when not attached to a bike.  To get a handlebar, you have to buy a stroller kit, which is a fair chunk of change - I am thinking I could craft something with PVC to fill the need of pulling it around easier.  It lacks a suspension system but for most people, the 20-inch air filled tires plus give of the fabric seat will provide a smooth enough ride that this won't be an issue.If you are set on a Chariot and you don't wish to use your trailer as a stroller, this little guy will serve you well.  It's not perfect, but it's got a lot going for it for the price.",4

"Stokke Tripp Trapp Highchair, Red","This chair calls to the yuppie crowd, and I understand.  Not long after our daughter was born, we had our fill of the plastic-Pooh-jungle decor.  My wife bought this chair, and after seeing the price, I expected to loathe it.  However, the chair looks better than I expected.  It is smaller than I thought it would be, pulling up to the table in no more space than one of our other chairs.  While the construction is not furniture quality (some easy assembly required), the nuts and bolts are well designed.  Specifically, the bolts can be tightened and loosened without fear that the chair will weaken with each turn of the included allen wrench tool.  As an aside, Stokke kept shipping material to a bare minimum, and yet the parts arrived unblemished.What I don't like about this chic baby feeder are the straps to hold the baby in the chair.  They are somewhat difficult to adjust, and they are even more difficult to use with the baby set accessory.  As elegant as the rest of this chair is, the straps look completely out of place.  Like some dude just shot a single screw through a bunch of nylon straps and called it good.  Also, the baby set is cheap looking and cheap feeling, but not cheap.  It is made out of hard plastic that doesn't look comfortable, but a comfortable cushion is available separately for another $40.  For what kind of highchair must one purchase an ""optional"" accessory to accomodate a baby?  Was that not the point in buying the highchair in the first place?  At least the up front investment, though galling, eases over time.December 2010 - we've now had the Stokke for over a year now, and I do really like the adjustable seat/footrest.  The Stokke keeps our toddler at the perfect level at the table, and we will not need to buy a booster chair to replace the high chair.  When in my parents' high chair, our daughter now seems too high and far away from the table.December 2011 - My daughter is 2.5 years old now and still using this chair.  She's been crawling up into the chair by herself and crawling back down for the last year.  Because of the design, she can push the chair away from the table without fear that it will tip over (wood floors).  Given the longevity of this chair and its versatility, it has earned at least another half star from me.  It is holding up very well and it is easy to clean.",4

Chicco Lullaby Magic Play Yard - Rattania,"We just bought this exact play yard yesterday (23 May 2013) from the local Babies R Us for $199.99 (it was not on sale). I really like the colors, it's sturdy, and it does what it's supposed to.I preferred this one over the SE and LX versions of Chicco's play yards because the changing table completely removes from the frame, and because the mobile swings off to the side. In the reviews for the SE and LX versions I read that the mobile can be a hassle because it stretches over the whole play yard, although that mobile does double as a floor gym and this one does not. The price differences at Babies R Us were SE-179.99, XL-189.99, and Magic-199.99.The padding for this version of Chicco's play yard is a tiny bit more soft than the SE and LX versions. It is almost a negligible difference, though.I like that the side pockets are open by the plastic frame. I'm sure I would have a harder time grabbing things out of the flat mesh ones in the SE or LX versions one handed.We're using it as a bassinet in the master bedroom for now, and we don't really anticipate packing it up and taking it anywhere. It took about 20 minutes to assemble, and I'm sure that time would be cut by more than half the next time we need to assemble it.Now I just need my baby to be born so he can try it out! We did buy a separate 1"" thick pad for the bassinet setting just to add a little to the padding since we intend for the baby to sleep in it regularly. I look forward to using it!",5
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","I LOVE this swing. I used it with my 5 lb preemie baby and I'm still using it months later. It is VERY soft and comfortable for baby, and the mechanics are wonderful. The BEST thing about this swing is that it doesn't require batteries like the other similar models. For the amount of time that you use this swing, you do NOT want to be paying for batteries.Pros:--Plug in--Swing can be adjusted to swing at different speeds and positions--The mobile is great for babies!! You can set them in this swing and they will just stare at the mobile without even having the swing turned on. It is perfect for babies who don't like to swing just yet.--The swing is very quiet compared to other models.Cons:--The music could go on a little longer. It is on an automatic timer and I think it turns off around 15 minutes*Update*: My baby is now 20 pounds, 8 months old and using the swing as I type this. I can't emphasize enough how much this swing has saved my sanity. No matter how fussy the baby, how hard she is crying, this swing will calm her down and give me a much-needed break. After 8 months, this swing still works like brand new and I am impressed at the high quality of the materials, fabrics, and motor.",5
Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up,Potty training my son was difficult because he was afraid of falling into the toilet bowl. The other potties that we bought for his use was also uncomfortable to him. As I began to run out of options and frustration began to set in I decided to purchase this product. It took him about three days to become comfortable with its use but boy was I happy when I realized that he did his first poo-poo using the toilet. He got accustomed to using the Mommy's helper. Now I have no problems asking him to use the toilet. He now asks to go use the toilet instead of asking for a pamper (diaper). Thanks to Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up.,5
Summer Infant Resting Up Portable Napper,This little napper is so handy.  First it's soft and very comforatble for baby. The baby can sit in it when I'm doing stuff around the house. The baby can actually sleepy comfortably in it.It's also very light and portable. My baby goes back and forth between home and grandma's house and this was travelling along with baby very easily. We just received a similar one (Fisher Price) as a gift that is bulkier. So now we have one at home and one at grandma's. But I have to say the color scheme on this napper is just more pleasant and soothing AND gender neutral. The FP one is dark brown with bright pink accents. Not quite as lovely. I hope to keep this one for my next child (boy or girl).I would recommend this napper.,5
WubbaNub Green Frog,As advertised,5
SOHO Giraffe Diaper Bag 3 in 1 with changing pad &amp; Bottle case (Black),"I bought this bag because it looked stylish and looked like it was big enough to fit 2 bottles, 1 water bottle, 1 paci,1 change of clothes, wipes and 4 diapers and it was! I even had enough space to put some of my things too like make up wallet and other things. I love the bottle bag because it helps to keep the inside clean. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I washed it and the black stained the white making it grey and the inside has black spots too. Those who say the bag is not big enough must have 5 kids or something i don't really see how much more space you may need.",4
Regal Lager Diaper Dekor,"It is good for new born mess, but once the little ones start to really start filling their diaper it stinks. We loved it at first then when our little girls diapers started to fill up it really started to stink",1
"Philips AVENT Large Massage Cushion for Comfort Pumps, Clear, Large","The product itself seems fine and I'm sure serves the purpose stated, but it doesn't really fit my standard size Avent double electric pump.  I couldn't find extra (regular size) massage cushions anywhere, so I bought these large ones and unfortunately, they just don't fit right.  Please make it easier to find extra pieces, Avent! (No one wants to be without back ups when pumping daily!)",3
bumGenius One-Size Hook &amp; Loop Closure Cloth Diaper 4.0 - Blossom,Don't get the velcro as it wears out quickly.  We sent back 9mts after purchase and were denied warranty.  We love our fuzzibunz pocket diapers w/ snaps.,1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Early Walker Wearable Blanket, Baby Blue, Large","Tips: Follow the sizing chart. Resist the urge to size up.Our son is 22 months, 33.5in and 26lbs. Debated ordering the L or XL since he was on the borderline between the 2 sizes. We ordered the Large, but the day after we found a XL in a second hand store. We bought it and the XL was way too big. We're glad we bought the L and just going to save the XL for him to grow into (which won't be for a long while). I expect him to use the L for a few months.",5
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack, Lavender or Citrus",Not very impressed with the product. Sprinkling baking soda in the diaper pail works better. There is absolutely no scent to this product.,1
"DwellStudio Wash Cloth and Mitt Set, Dots",Nothing special about this set. We actually got it to use the bath mitt as a &#34;potholder&#34; to remove bottles from our bottle warmer. We like the terry cloth to dry the bottles with. Never used it as a bath mitt. The washcloths are kinda scratchy so won't use them on the baby.,2
"Graco Pack N Play Playard with Bassinet, Pasadena",The mattress gets bunched up in the middle so doesn't lay flat. I would not want to purchase this again.,3
"Dapper Snapper Baby &amp; Toddler Adjustable Belt- Boy's Colors: Navy, Beige and Black","We bought these for our 1.5yo before we discovered adjustable waist band pants.  Our son is under the 25th percentile for weight and pretty average for height.  These snappers help, but there are times when I wished there was more versatility in the amount you can actually cinch.  In other words, sometimes the cinch isn't enough for it to be comfortably secure, but enough so it won't fall down.We have since discovered and bought only adjustable waist band pants, so we don't have a need for these anymore, but totally worth it if your child isn't quite fitting the 18-24 mo or 2T sizes where this feature is available yet.",4
"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Closed Security Gate, Black","I use the Extra Tall Dreambaby for dogs to keep them where I need them and out of where you don't need to be.  Works great in doorways and stairways. If installed correctly, it will close automatically EVERY TIME! It is a pretty tall and sturdy gate so I don't worry about my Dobermans scaling it or jumping over it. It latches at top so I'm sure it is child/kid save and friendly. I have 2 white gates and they stay pretty clean. A family member has the black version. It works and looks just as nice. Highly recommend.",5
"Munchkin Feeding Set, 15 Pack","These are simple and useful. The colors are nice and bright, and fairly unisex. The fish design on the pieces is cute and the kids seem to like them. These plates are not as good as the old design - they are flatter and do not have an edge on them. This makes them easier to clean, but it is much easier for kids to scoop food off the edge of the plate since there is nothing there to stop it. The older version of these plates had a band around the edge in a contrasting color that would help. Still, a nice set and a nice value. My kids use these every day.",4
Cuddlekin Dog Muckel,"I bought this for my son's first birthday.  I was looking for a stuffed animal that he could """"bond"""" with that didn't have any removable eyes or choking hazards since he puts EVERYTHING into his mouth.  This dog is so cute and really soft and huggable.  My son is now 18 months old and sleeps with it every night.  I watch him in the video baby monitor snuggling with it until he falls asleep.  It's soooo sweet.",5
"Summer Infant Deluxe Piddle Pad, Black - 2 Pack","Recently received this product to protect car seat from accidents.  It is absorbent and comfortable for my toddler.  Works great, no complaints.  I recommend!",5
Go Anywhere Table and Footrest,"This is well constructed and sturdy.  It's very adjustable, so it works lots of ways.  And the tray table slides easily out of the foot rest.  I only have two complaints.  #1, the foot rest doesn't attach to anything, it just sits under the car seat, so it always wants to slide out or the car seat slides around on top of it.  I sandwich it between a bath towel to keep it from sliding around.  #2, the foot rest part always slides down.  The way it is supposed to stay put is with downward pressure from the child's foot.  But children move around a lot, obviously, and whenever my son lifts his feet up, the foot rest slides down so his feet no longer reach it.Also, I'm curious as to the safety of this.  I wonder what would happen if I had an accident while using this tray table.  I wish there was information on that.",4
"Eddie Bauer Vantage Highback Booster, Blue",I have a Eddie Bauer 22-859-afd highback DON'T buy their products could not secure the latches over 3 hours trying.  Friend had a Graco and secured his in 2 minutes.  Called company no help there.  Stay away from Eddie Bauer car seats is my opinionn.  Company doesn't stand behind product.,1
Lamaze: Pupsqueak the Puppy,"I bought this for my infant son. It was smaller than I imagined, but since it will clip to seats, strollers, etc, the size is nice. We (my children and I) all like Pupsqueak, but I think the price (when s&h was added in) was high. Pupsqueak is great as a $5 toy.",4
"Sassy Soft Swimmers Animal Characters Bath Toy, 3 Pack","I looked at A LOT of bath toys before choosing these. I didn't have a lot of money to spend and of all the similarly priced toys these seemed to be the best choice. They arrived and I was instantly positive I had made the right choice. They look like the pictures and are made with a variety of textures (soft, hard, scratchy, smooth). They are also easily washable. I throw them in the washing machine and then set them in front of a fan to speed drying.My daughter (22 weeks) LOVES these. Especially chasing them down with her little flailing hands and chewing on them. If you wring them out and place them out to dry they don't take too very long. Similar to a wet towel after a shower.The squirter toys get the water out a good distance so be careful!I am very pleased with this purchase.Oh - sidenote - I was at BabysRUs and saw these for sale. The price was $5.99 for the octopus and the fish. So purchasing onine at Amazon was definitely the way to go.",5
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Cuddle Cove Rocking Seat, Winslet","Purchased this item for a co-worker perfect for her needs- pattern was beautiful and all was easy to put together,",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,"These are great monitors.  This is my third set between these and the double parent unit.  I leave mine on 24/7. I have the double set up with the base in the nursery, a parent unit in the bedroom and one in the living room.  I have the single base next to the one in the living room with the parent unit in the basement so I can piggyback off the nursery unit.  Of all the monitors I have used, these seem to have the best reception.  Mine are seldom on battery power, but when I do unplug a parent unit, it works for what I need it to.  The only background noise I hear with these is the air vents on occasion.  My old ones would pick up a train 2 miles away.  I'm partially deaf, but I can still hear when my son rolls over, even in the basement with my piggyback contraption set up.Without fail, within about 6 months they lose connection and there is nothing you can do about it.  Amazon has been great about returns so far.  They pay the return shipping and send me new ones before they even get the return.  I wonder if Vtech will ever fix the problem.",5
Munchkin Sea n Play Shopping Cart Cover,"This helps keep my little man busy so the melt-downs are minimal!  There is not really any cushion where the child sits if that is a concern of yours.  It does not bother me, or my child, he is in diapers so there's plenty of cushion for a trip around the store.  The toy bar gives him something to tinker with while I do my thing, and he can't throw any of it on the floor!  Once you get used to it, the put-on and take-down can easily be one-handed.  It does not fit the really large carts, but will cover what needs covered easily - so not a problem.  Very convenient and keeps baby from tasting the basket and getting those germs!  I'm glad I purchased this one and not one of the more expensive versions!Wanted to add here, in case there is any confusion due to the low rating that was posted - I have thrown my cover in the washer MANY times now - nope, not even in a bag - and it has been just fine! No rips, tears, velcro works like new, not even faded. To this day (almost 9 months later) I still LOVE this cover...not as worried about germs anymore, but it's great for keeping the snacks/mess contained! Get out to the parking lot and just shake it out!",5
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White","The quality of this product is great and it is far superior to the little plastic inserts people put in their outlets (my daughter would have removed those around 7 months or earlier). I've replaced all the outlets in my daughter's room and in my living area where she crawls around.Be aware that the screw to attach this cover to the actual outlet is in the middle. My old outlets had the screws on the top and bottom, so I had to replace all the actual outlets as well, but that's no fault of the product.",5
Levana Keera 32012 Remote Controlled Pan/Tilt/Zoom Camera with 3.5-Inch Screen (White/Black),"This has got to be the most awesome camera we've had in our 3 child home.  We've had other video monitors, but none have offered the side to side motion, as well as the ability to speak through the camera.  My husband and I laughed hysterically when we told our three year old to get back in bed and stop messing with her sister.  She hid under the covers and was afraid to get out of bed again because somehow she was caught the first time.This camera also offers a lot of extras, which you can read in the product description.Holds a good charge.  Had it for a week and only plugged it in once, initially.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Nipple Protector, Standard","I think these shields are wonderful and they definitely helped me get through some painful nursing. I'm giving them 3 stars because even though I liked them my daughter, not so much! She knew they were foreign and sometimes didn't want to latch.",3
Dreambaby Super Toy Hammock and Toy Chain,It helps take  clutter off the bed,5
"Regalo Extra Tall Widespan Gate, White","The height is perfect. The width... not so much. The doorway is too narrow to use both extensions on the gate, but too wide to only use one. Otherwise the size is great.I use the gate to keep my cats out of the kitchen and dining room, but the gaps between the bars are just wide enough that one of the cats can squeeze through. I saw a few other reviews mentioning similar, so I was almost expecting this to happen. If you're thinking of this gate to use with a cat or cats, I suggest you prepare for a similar experience. I'm going to weave strips of fabric through the bars and block the open areas. Hopefully that will be enough to keep my feline Houdini from escaping all the time.With those exceptions, the gate is perfect. It seems to be a lightweight but sturdy gate; it fits my home much better than the old plastic sliding gate I used to have. I'm short and was sick and tired of stepping over it all the time and knocking it loose because I'm not tall enough to clear it easily. I love that this gate has a door in it and that each corner cab be adjusted individually. It fits much better.So all in all, not completely perfect for my home, but the most perfect gate I've found so far.",4
"Philips AVENT Translucent Orthodontic Infant Pacifier, Clear, 0-6 Months",I have tried a couple brands and styles over the last couple years with my two girls and these are the only ones they have ever liked.,5
ReSqueeze Reusable Food Pouch (4-pack),"I like these pouches because you can open them from the bottom and therefore you can fill in the puree manually without the infantino squeeze station. You just scoop you puree from the blender and into the pouches. Done.I wish they make a bigger version of these pouches though, 6 oz is too little I think. But anyway it's a brilliant idea these pouches!If you are on the budget, skip the infantino squeeze station and just order some of these pouches, trust me you don't need the squeezer it's just gimmicky.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Contemporary Freeflow Pacifier, 0-6 Months, 2-Pack, Colors and Designs May Vary",What I like most about these is that they come with the covers that pop on and off easily so that the nipple itself stays protected.  They are nice and not at all flimsy like some of the other ones I have seen.  They do not irritate her mouth either.,5
KidGear The Teethifier II,Sadly this was a waste of money for us. We ended up giving this teether away. My daughter refused to use it. Maybe she didn't like it since she never was a fan of a pacifier.It was well made and arrived on time.,3
"Bumkins Junior Bib, Blue Fizz","These are hands down ""the"" best bibs I have used! They cover everything that needs to be protected and baby can't yank it off. They wipe up easily,resist stains and are waterproof. The patterns are bright, bold and fun. I love the fact that they actually fit my daughter, without having to use clothes pins to keep it on her. I used to use Parent's Choice waterproof bibs. They were way too big around the neck and didn't cover very well. They were ok, but nothing compared to these bibs. I will now only buy these. Highly recommended!",5
Safety 1st Swing Shut Toilet Lock,"We purchased the Safety 1st toilet lock when our little one started splashing in the toilet bowl.  It is a great product!  No more splashing!The instructions are easy to follow and installation took just a couple of minutes.Once installed you need two hands to slide the lock and press the button in order to release the locking arm, which is, of course, why it defeats little hands, but can be a bit of a puzzle for guests.Just shut the lid and the locking arm instantly slides back into place.  Shut and done!",5
"FuzziBunz Perfect Size Cloth Diaper, Cotton Candy, Large 25-40+ lbs","I wanted to write in praise of the large size for my toddler. I only started using cloth diapers at 20 months and when he was 32 pounds. I first tried the one size elite and they barely could snap around his thighs, which are pretty average size. So after a month or so, they were getting too tight. I really liked the ease of use, the colors and the speed of drying, but thought I was going to have to give up until I read that there were perfect sizes. The large is supposed to fit 40+ pounds and by then he was about 35 pounds, so I tried them. They fit thank goodness and he likes them compared to the large Kushies Classics I also tried because they had the larger sizes. So I wanted to share that mom's with toddlers can still use cloth diapers after they no longer fit the one size. I am hoping he will potty train with the next 6 months, but if not I am hopeful these will still fit. I hope they continue to my the perfect fit because one size does NOT fit all!",5
"Itzy Ritzy Snack HappensSnack Mini Reusable Snack Bag, Social Circle Pink, 2-Count","My daughter absolutely loves these bags. They are perfect for carrying her snacks around in and are so adorable. Everywhere we go, we get compliments on them. They are very durable and so far, have yet to fade from several washings. Great product! Would highly recommend.",5
Kawaii Baby One-Size Snap Closure Pocket,"At well past the danger of losing my baby at 19 weeks we started trying to prepare for our first daughter's arrival.  While I, unfortunately, know no time during pregnancy is free from danger the chances of losing my daughter at that point were less than .5%.  I was really interested in cloth diapering and ran across Kawaii brand.  I purchased 20 diapers for $120 and received 1 free.  I also received free shipping.  I was ecstatic.  I couldn't wait to receive them.  Unfortunately before I received my order my daughter was stillborn at 20.2 weeks.  We were devastated!  She was our dream.  I immediately contacted Kawaii and informed them of our circumstances.  I was informed their return policy stated that we had to pay to ship the diapers back to them and (as punishment for returning them) also pay for our free shipping. While I understand that every company has to have a return policy, for their protection, exceptions can be made for extenuating circumstances.  How heartless is it to punish a parent for losing a child???  I wasn't returning them because I didn't want them or like them, as a matter of fact I was looking forward to buying more.  So as punishment I would loose (minimum) $45 for a $120 order, which I really couldn't afford.  So now I'm forced to either keep these diapers and give MY baby's diapers as gifts to other babies (I'm sure that is going to be extremely hard) or sell them for what I can get out of them.  I feel it is extremely heartless to force a grieving parent into this situation.  From my experience I would not recommend Kawaii brand diapers based on their heartless business practices.Sincerely,Cynthia Petersen(Desperately Grieving Mother)",1
"Snuggin Go Too Child Positioner, Black","This thing looks so weird and at firt I had no idea what to actually do with it.  I ended up using it in everything from strollers to bouncy seats.  Its soft and really supports any size baby.  Give it a try, you can always return it.",4
Nosefrida Hygiene Filters,"I initially thought I might not need these, but for all of the stuff you'll be sucking out of your baby's nose, I would go ahead and get them.  I'd rather have these on hand instead of running out when you need them.  I bought my Nosefrida three months ago, and I'm just now opening my package of extra filters, but I'm glad I have them.",5
"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red",It's light and easy. My wife loves the style and portability of it. It's nice...it's expensive but worth it. It's perfect for the city.  Smooth as the bigger strollers,5
Dr. Brown's 6 Pack Natural Flow Level 3 Standard Nipple,"we got these level 3 nipples for our baby with acid reflux, since we have to mix rice in his bottle these allow it to flow very well, and he isn't struggling to suck the formula out  we mix 1 tablespoon of rice for 2 ounces prepared formula.  however we are switching to playtex drop inns nurser because we are sick of washing all the parts for the dr. browns bottles",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I will not waste your time echoing all of the fabulous things that have been said about this tub by others before me.  I give it 5 stars - enough said.  Many of the reviews are from parents with very young babies.  I'd like to give a perspective from a Mom with an older baby:I have used this tub since my son's very first bath.  He is now 18 months old and this is still the only tub that I've had to buy.  He still fits in it just fine, and I still use the lay back side to wash his hair.  Then we simply turn around to sit on the larger side to splash and play.If you're looking for a tub that will last you for the long haul, this is the tub for you. I'm not looking forward to giving up the security aspects of this tub when my son outgrows it.  I'll try to keep using it as long as I possibly can.",5
"Summer Infant Keep Me Clean Disposable Potty Protectors, Green/White,(Pack of 2), 10-Count","I bought these and the Potty Covers to try both. I liked the Potty Covers better but they are more expensive. These were ok and got the job done but they are supposed to have two little tape strips to peel off and stick them to the toilette seat to stop it from slipping. Some of the covers only had one strip and some had one on the correct side and one on the side you sit on. They were kind of all over the place. Other than that they were ok and they were pretty cheap. They came in a big bag that wasn't super convenient too. The Potty Covers come individually wrapped so you can just pop a couple in your bag at a time. In any case, these cover the seat well and my two year old was able to hold onto the potty without actually touching the seat.",3
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel",My daughter loves this carrier almost instantly wether she is fussy or not she falls asleep she is that comfortable in it.  Those long sleepless night I got the carrier out put her in it and she was out! I love this color it goes with everything stays clean and very stylish.  This carrier is very comfortable for me to wear all the weight sits on my hips and not my back or shoulders.  I love it! And so does my baby.,5
Wire Guard 2-Pack,"I love this item! It's very effective. For the reviewer that says it's not long enough I'm sorry. It does tell you how long it is, so you may have to buy two packs!  We love this childproofing item!",5
The First Years Clean Air Filter Replacement 2 pk,"of all the diaper pails I've seen so far, the First Years Clean Air system is pretty darn good. What makes it pretty darn good, though, are the carbon filters which eventually need to be replaced. Buying these filters via Amazon just so happens to be the best idea since they're so inexpensive.",4
Kushies Taffeta Potty Training Pants - Large - Milky Latte,"I LOVE these training pants.  Yes, they are a little puffy.  However, if you pat some of the air out when they are on your child they seem to look a little better (they also fit under the clothes better).  My toddler was so excited when he got these in the mail.  I told him they were big boy underpants and that he could wear them at night (and when we goes out and about).  I told him that he was not allowed to pee in these.  However, if he had an accident, these underpants would let him pee a little in then and then he could run to the potty.  Since I've been using these, my child has gone from using the potty 40% of the time to 90% of the time (amazing...I know...but it is true.  I was ASTONISHED and VERY pleased.  It was an amazing change since disposable pullups).  They do run a little small.  My child is smaller than average so the tKushies sizing chart worked for us.  However, they did shrink in the dryer.  I suggest buying one of the size you think your child is and one larger for trial.  Once you decide which one is best then buy in bulk.  You will not regret this purchase if you are sincerely looking to switch from a diaper trained to a potty trained child.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"4/24/12 Edit:My son is now 10 months old and still well within the weight limits but, the spring holding one of the sides to frame snapped. Their is no fixing it and it is pretty sharp also. I called fisher price today and they are refunding my original purchase price ($62.01). I have to pay return shipping on the post and the seat hold. I also have to find a box for it... ugh is all I can say that explains it right now. Maybe this will happen again maybe it won't. Buy at your own discretion.Original Review: (2/12)We purchased this toy when our son was 5 months old and started jumping well we were holding him. He loved it the first time we put him in it a 4 months later (9 months old) he still absolutely loves it. You can not go wrong with this purchase.Also I've read a lot of reviews with people reporting that their baby pinched his/her finger on the elephant. Although I have never yet had this happen to my son I feel (after experimenting with my finger near the elephant) that it more scares the children rather then hurts them.",3
Symphony in B Music Toy,"Bought this for friends daughter after first buying it for our son.  Great interactive toy.  B. toys were also very good, and although there was a mistake with the order, they corrected it straight away with no drama.  I always judge businesses on how they handle situations when they go wrong, and B Toys were extremely fast and professional in rectifying the problem. Will buy from them again.",5
"Bright Starts Comfort and Harmony Portable Swing, Florabella","As many other reviewers have noted there is really only one position and it's far from optimal for the baby.  Also the swing shuts off after an hour.  Despite that we kept it and our baby will sleep it provided it is swinging. It worked fine at first, but after about 2-weeks of regular use it won't swing consistently. We have to mess with the leg positioning to get it to work and randomly (probably if the baby moves?) it'll stop. We tried replacing the batteries and that didn't help. I hope it's not too late to return it!",2
Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Wipes Refill 350ct.,"Never have had an issue with these wipes, and I have bought them numerous times.  They are sturdy and soft while having natural ingredients that I feel comfortable putting on my baby.  These are the only kind of wipes we will buy!",5
Disney Friendship Pooh Lamp Base And Shade,Perfectly cute. Great quality..Characters are 'as is'..meaning Pooh looks like Pooh..etc..I'm really funny about when characters are recreated and don't look exactly like their TV version..Bulb that comes with it is pretty bright..so if you're looking for a soft light for the nursery for night time feedings..you'll need to switch out the bulb to a lower wattage..,5
"aden + anais Newborn Baby Gift Set, Liam The Brave","This was an amazing sampling of the Aden + Anais products for a great price!

"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free Ventaire Crystal Clear Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce",Got these bottles and figured they would work the same as the ones that we usually buy from Walmart/Target.  We had a problem with 2 of the seals not sealing enough and the formula would drip out of the bottom.  Bought some of the ones from Walmart and we do not have that problem at all.,3

5 x 2 Way Dotting Marbleizing Pen Set with Free Bonus &quot;Hello Kitty&quot; Gold Nail Art Decoration and Rhinestones,"I don't do nails, however, I do other c raft things that sometimes need finer dotting tools. Most of the ones I have are bigger, and these are smaller. They pretty m ugh me t my expectations. Thank you! I gave the second set to a friend. She said &#34;Cool!&#34;",4
Tiny Love Classic Mobile,"My mum gave this to me when my daughter was about 1 month..and I am SOOO grateful. We originally had one of those mobiles that you  had to wind up....which gave me all of 3 minutes to get something done before I had to wind it again. The beauty of this mobile is the time. You dont have to wind the mobile up every 3 minutes..I think when you press the button it last at least 15 minutes - almost 20.  From the time my baby was able to focus 2-3 month- she loved to watch the mobile & since I did not have to wind it every 2 minutes - I was able to leave her alone for a few minutes to pump, shower, laundry..well you name it - 15 minutes is a lot of time with a new baby. The variety of songs (and not rock-a-bye-baby) is also great. We still havent gotten sick of it and my baby is almost 8 months (we have one side of the crib higher than the other - so we have moved it to the higher level so she still cant touch it). Buy it, Try it, You'll love it!!  We do have Babies R Us DaVinci Crib and we had a little issue getting the mobile on at first since there is a lip to the crib - but we were finally able to jimmy it on there safely and it was worth not giving up!",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","This is the second Regalo gate we have bought, and we continue to be happy with their products.  We use this one to prevent our Husky from going up to our second floor, so the lower overall height isn't a problem for us.  I would recommend the Extra Tall Gate if height is a concern for you.  My favorite feature of this gate is how easy it is to open the walk thru gate, you can operate it with just one hand.  Additionally, it was very easy to install, which is great as my husband and I aren't very handy. Overall for the price and quality of the gate, I recommend this gate.",5
BOB Weather Shield For Single Revolution/Stroller Strides Models in Gray,"When I opened the instructions for this product, they were long and relatively daunting.  But, they ended up being really helpful and the weather cover was really easy to put on our Bob Revlolution.  And my daughter likes it - she asks for it, saying ""window! window!""  And it is really nice to know that she is protected from the wind and rain.",4
"Pura Stainless Kiki Three Infant Bottle Starter Set, 5 Ounce, Green/Aqua, 0-6 Months","I got these bottles for my youngest son and am so happy with them!  I have had every stainless steel bottle and sippy out there and have complaints about them all... except this one!  Finally one that works well!  The other ones that didn't work had a plastic ring/collar that broke, one leaked, one was too big for my little guy to hold on his own, etc. etc.  This one is slim, no plastic, and works well.  Function and cool colors!",4
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","We have been looking for a cloth diaper to switch to for our second child, using my 2yr old son as a product tester.  He is a tall skinny boy (37in, 32lbs) so these have been great. We set it to the recommended numbers for 30+lbs.  He loves it and digs through the laundey to find the one we have, its his ""comphy diaper...ah"".We tried G-Diapers and he hated them, called them ""ouie diapers"" and threw fits.  The location of the liner snaps fall right at the bend in the hip and leave little red circles.  The internal liner also slides a bit letting feces and such fill the little liner hammock. Did Bummies and he is ok with them, but the velcro is too easy for any 2yr old with fingers to unhook at inopertune times.  My close friend loves the Bummies for her little girl, shes 7 mo so the fingers have yet to get too curious.  She has the different sizes and I used the one-size.  The one-size Bummies doesnt adjust half as much as this one can!We have ordered more, he is very excited to get them.  Our red one was washed 4 times before use and about 15 times since and still feels/looks great.  We are using the flushable liners for easy poop removal, definatly nice.",5
"Evenflo Compact Fold High Chair, Covington",Very light weight. Folds for storage. Easy to clean and and fold away. Tray is easy to slide on to the chair.,5
Starfish Bath Warter Alarm and Temperature Monitor,"Works and sounds the alarm when water is present.The alarm should probably be as loud as a smoke alarm, but it isn't.  If it were louder, I would have given it 5 stars.Nonetheless, I would purchase again since our home has the handle-type faucets in the bath tubs.  Handle-type faucets can be turned on by toddlers. A very dangerous situation, if the toddler climbs into the tub.I purchased 3 of the Starfish and placed them flat on the each of the 3 tub bottoms.  They also work well on the sides of the tub, but that allows more to accumulate before the alarm goes off.",4
Philips AVENT BPA Free Infant Bottle Starter Set,"I agree with others here that the BPA-free bottles leak!  Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.  Tight, loose, or anywhere in between...they still leak.  Very frustrating.  And it always happens at the worst times...when the baby is screaming to be fed, or course.  And it doesn't just drip, it drips faster and faster, soaking the child's chest in as little as 3-5 seconds!I used the original (non BPA-free) Avent bottles with my 1st child.  Those leaked when overtightened, but the directions warned of that.  So you just had to not overtighten the tops, and there were no issues.I bought the BPA free Avent bottles with my 2nd child.  Those are the problem!  BIG difference from the originals, although I can't imagine why.My 2nd child is now just over 2 months old, but I'm considering buying new bottles now because I'm sick of the anger and frustration these cause when I'm trying to feed a starving baby and they are pouring milk everywhere!  And of course that is bad after spending an average of $9 per bottle on these...times 8!  ugh!",1
BRICA Cover Guard Car Seat Travel Tote,"I searched for weeks for a cover to keep my graco my ride 65 safe and finally found this one, babies r us had them in stock but not on the shelf, I didn't believe it would fit because so many others claim it would and it didn't so I actually tried it on the car seat in the store and FINALLY!!!! A bag that works!!! So happy",4
Top Brand Discounts 4 u Baby on Board and Child on Board Car Safety Sign,"I received only the baby on board sign and it was damaged, it has a 2"" cut on a corner.",1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,I love this pillow. I am 5 months pregnancy and this is helping me with my lower back pain.,5
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"We bought this stroller last night and just like a review on Jan 30. have found that the Graco Snug Ride does not ""snap"" into place securely... there is about 2-3 inches of play and you can actually remove the seat without using the red handle to depress the lock!?  With the safety strap in place, it seems to be stable enough but we are perplexed by the amount of ""play"" in the fit.  And yes, we have read the directions a dozen times and are confident that all the bars, etc. are in the proper place as the directions are very clear and everything is labled as well.  We really like the concept of this stroller and love it otherwise, just aren't sure how safe it is with the fit.",2
Infantino Sash Mei Tai Carrier Black/Gray,Its a good carrier it just takes some getting used to putting on.  My only concern is wearing baby in it in warm weather.,4
"Goldbug Animal 2 in 1 Harness, Horse",too large to pack well in diaper bag and no way to put things inside easily.  If child falls it will be their head hitting the ground as the parent leash part connect to the base of the doggie...,2

Baby Safety Harness Kid keeper Toddler Backpack Strap-C - Gaorui,The backpack is small and lightweight and the harness fits comfortably on our special needs child.  It gives her a litte independence and me the control I need to make her safe.,5
"The First Years Indigo Stroller, Red","We got this stroller about two years ago and it has worked really well for us. When we purchased it, it was one of the only strollers with all the options (plus the universal car seat adapter) in that price range. We have gotten a lot of use out of it! Like other who complained about the wheels squeaking or getting stuck, we experienced the same thing, but we skipped the WD-40 and used lithium grease. It solved the problem and it hasn't returned in two years time.Pros:-Lots of options for your child-Great recline-Universal car seat adapter-Large storage basket-Parent console-Maneuvers well-Folds easily-Easy to adjustCons:-Heavy-The sun shade is super small (my biggest beef with the stroller)-Poor shock absorbance (if you go over a bump and have a drink in the parent console, expect spillage)While it's not the perfect stroller, it was good for the money (we got it for under $150). We are now expecting baby #2 and looking at doubles. Sad that this stroller won't be accommodating for our growing family.",4
Jolly Jumper Bath Tub Toy Bag,I read some reviews saying the suction cups didn't stick or that the product didn't hold much. I followed the suggestion of some reviewers and that was to clean the shower wall and then rub it down with rubbing alcohol. Dry the wall and rub the suction cups with the rubbing alcohol. I did this and mine stuck wonderfully and is holding a bunch of toys.(most are not even &#34;bathtub&#34; toys. They are heavy rubber dinosaurs) I love this little item so much I bought another one. This would make a great babyshower gift because I never thought about needing something like this until I really needed it!,5
"JJ Cole Collections Stroller Attachment, Graphite",I have a storksak Isabella bag and I thought $20 for the storksak clips were a little too much. So I looked around and found these. I've only used them once so I can't comment on how durable it is but it's doin the same job as the storksak clips for way less!!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Our son is teething and has been for about a month.  He just doesn't like this toy.  Even if he did like it, I'd still feel like a sucker.  Overpriced!",2
"Vital Baby Toddler Straw Cup, Orange, 10 Ounce","Like other reviewers mentioned, it is extremely difficult to drink from this cup even for an adult.  I had to slice the plastic ""strap"" on the straw part and also slice open a little more on the pressure relief valve in order to drink from it.  Once that's done, it works quite well and I bought a total of 5 cups.Otherwise, of course it is no spill if you can't even drink from it.",3
LaJobi Palisades Convertible Crib (Natural Cherry),"My wife and wanted a baby bed that would be great as a crib and very well suited to transition into a full sized bed for our boy when he comes of age. We have received many complements, but we were sold on how well built it was and the safety ratings as well as the look is why we purchased. I'm not much for reviews. That is leaving them but after reading the terrible one I felt compelled to offer a second opinion if you will. We also bought the dresser combo also and my wife really loves it. It doubles for us as a changing table. I recommend it! We too found it on sale too. It's a great value at under $300 get it while you still can. Best wishes.",5
"Kushies Washable Pre-folded Diapers, White","These are awesome.  We use them for burp cloths, padding around seats, for games of peek-a-boo, sloppy spills and all.  They are extremely soft and hold up wash after wash.  With 2 reflux-y babies, these were a must!",5
Giant Peel &amp; Stick Nursery Decal - Forest Animals &amp; Flowers Tree for Boys &amp; Girls (Tree Assembles 4.7 Feet Tall),This decal was incredibly easy to apply and has stayed put even after some repositioning.  The colors are as shown.,5
Reed &amp; Barton Silver Safari 3-Piece Baby Flatware Set,"Anyone who wants a lovely present for a child, grandchild or other beloved urchin will be pleased with this item. It is useful several years beyond birth.",5
Fisher-Price My Little Snugabunny Newborn Rock n' Play Sleeper,"My daughter has pretty bad reflux.  We bought this after reading all of the other reviews about how it has helped other babies with reflux to sleep more soundly.  Well, it has definitely worked for us!  Our little girl no longer wakes up screaming or choking in the middle of the night which means I get more rest too.  Just keep in mind that if your baby has to be swaddled tight to sleep, this can present a problem since the angle of the rock n' play, while great for reflux, can make the swaddle too tight around the belly and this makes it very uncomfortable for baby.  We are now experimenting with other types of swaddling products to find one that will hold her tight but be flexible enough around the midsection that she can sleep more comfortably in the rock n' play.  She breaks out of regular swaddling blankets, the small/medium swaddleme is too small (she's 12 pounds and it's supposed to fit up to 14 pounds), the large swaddleme is too big, and I just ordered a woombie to try next.  Overall, the Snugabunny rock and play is a great product and I'm definitely glad we ordered it, we just have a few adjustments to make so that we're getting the best use of it.",4
"Babycity Suede Microfiber One Size Pocket Diaper with Snap Closure, Pink","I bought 5 babycity diapers, 2 of them (pink ones) de-laminated  before they were finished being prepped. Save your money and time",1
"Little Luxe Infant Car Seat Handle Arm Cushion, Black","I literally had bruises on my arm from carrying my son until I got this.  It gets in the way of some of those cute car seat covers though. It also can slip around a bit if you don't put it on tight enough. All in all, worth every penny and I'm getting some for gifts!",4
Burt's Bees - Baby Bee Shampoo &amp; Wash Tear Free Original - 12 oz.,"My daughter has used this on my granddaughter since birth.  It was recommended by the Exeter Hospital and she has used it ever since.  The baby is now 15mo. old today and has never had a problem.  She smells wonderful after her baths and guess what?  So does my puppy!  I figure if it is safe for the infants it must be safe for the puppy and it is and he smells great also.  Try it, it is well worth it.  Lasts a long time also.",5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink","This is easier to clean than the one we had previously, but it doesn't keep food warm very long.  I make sure to heat it up first with boiling water, but a couple of hours later the food is barely above room temperature.",2
"Quinny Buzz, Zapp Xtra and Moodd Compatibility Parasol, Black","These umbrellas are always a hassle, but this one is the best I've used. It is easy to take on and off and the springs are stiff enough to hold each position well. The umbrella is too small and difficult to position when the sun is lower in the sky. I find myself wishing that the metal bar would retract and expand as on a regular rain umbrella.",3
Wire Cube Connectors - Black - Set of 4 by Organize It All,"These were just what I needed to replace the lost ones for my ""grid system"". They fit fine, and are secure (as in I needed something to tap them to come off when I moved the grid). Since it is easy to lose these when the grid is in storage (such as in my black hole of a garage) it is great that they can be replaced at a reasonable price.",4
Bumkins S3-KH Keith Haring Waterproof Superbib 3-Pack with S3-B5 Boy Assortment Waterproof SuperBib 3-Pack,"Great bibs! Soft, yet sturdy, easy to wipe off and clean, colorful and fun, pouch catches a lot. Love all Bumkins bibs!",5
Generic Classic Metal Wall Mount Jewelry Organizer Hanging Heart Shape Earring Holder Bracelets Necklace Handbag Display Stand Hanger Rack (Black),I wasn't so impressed with this product.  Not that sturdy and it didn't come with any thing to mount it on the wall.,3
Delta 3-In-1 Activity Center Walker,This product is fantastic. I was having a hard time finding a colorful walker with lots of toys on them. All of the walkers I kept finding in the stores or online were plain & cheap looking until I found this one. If you are a parent & are having this problem then this is the walker for you.,5
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella","We purchased this carseat for traveling on an airplane because it was cheaper and safer than renting one. It is very light, only 9lbs, and easy to transport and install quickly. It is a little flimsy feeling, only plastic, but meets all safety requirements. I wouldn't use it for an every day seat, but it was great to take on our trip, especially for the price!",4
Safety 1st Prograde Complete Family Thermometer,I've had this thermometer since my son was born 4 years ago..... it's the only thing I've used and LOVE it. I am shocked there are so many negative reviews! I am buying another one for my 3rd baby due in a few weeks because the battery JUST died on this one (4 years later) and I changed the battery (which I had no issue getting a screwdriver in there) and then the kids played with it and I'm assuming broke it. I highly recommend.,5
GoGreen Champ&reg; One-Size Cloth Diaper (R2D-Poo),rinsing the double gussets in this diaper is hell. because they are 3 different fabrics for the main part and the gussets poop gets underneath and it takes 3 times as long. Also the double pul layer gets moist because of the stitching. I bought 2 and regret it.,2
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","this is very well made and uncomplicated to use.  the installation was straightforward with decent instructions.  it is nice that the gate opens in both directions, swings shut gently on its own, or stays open if extended wide open.",5
"Maxi Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat, Sweet Cerise","Very good car seat. Our son fits perfectly and the head doesnt move side ways.The color and fabric are lovely, and wechabe a chair for a couple of years.",5
"Joovy Room&sup2; Portable Playard, Red",the best baby cage.  Perfect for when you need to jump in the shower or you can pull it into the kitchen while making dinner,5
Safety 1st Bi-Fold Door Lock,"My 11 month old has a fascination with opening and closing doors, these work great to keep her out of the closests.  They work well and fit all 3 different style closet doors, I like that you can adjust the tightness of them very easily but they are difficult to slide off the hinge on certain door types thats why I only gave them 4 stars.",4
Infant Bucket Seat Liner Color: Pink,"My son is a sweat bucket every time I get him out of his car seat.  We bought this before a trip to the beach hoping it would help him stay drier in an even more hot environment.  It works!  He is noticeably happier in his seat, and he is nowhere near as sweaty when I get him out.",4
WubbaNub Pink Bear,"My daughter wouldn't take most pacifiers, but seemed to like the Soothie brand.  My mother-in-law found her the Wubbanub - it's the best of both worlds!  A little stuffed animal PLUS a Soothie pacifier.  We had to buy an extra so we have one on hand at all times.  She is seriously in love with her Wubbie :)  I often give these as baby shower gifts now since they are a favorite in our house!",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",The reviews speak for themselves.  I was in heaven when I received this bra.  Being able to type and channel the television while pumping has been awesome!,5
"JJ Cole Car Seat Cover, Khaki","I am giving this product a 3 star for a couple of reasons. We live in WI where cold and wind are common, unfortunately I don't feel this was the perfect choice for us. There is a gap by the handles that allows the cold air in and the top doesn't stay closed in windy conditions. It does work ok when we put a heavier blanket over the top but then that may blow off. Also, we are in the process of receiving a new one as the seam on the top cover came apart after only using it once on our car ride home. Safety reasons had me just replace this one. It does seem to much safer for baby then other ones out there. As far as the top not staying shut...I may just put a small piece of velcro on there to secure it better.",3
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"I bought two to keep one in each car.  It's small enough to fit in a smaller tote bag I carry around on the weekends when we are out and about.  I love that its a stand alone potty when we are in a pinch and a fold out seat that fits sturdy on commercial toilets in restaurants and stores.  I would have liked a better designed carry bag as its plastic with a drawstring that has not held up with time...but a plastic grocery bag is just as practical.  Besides, I suppose after a while, you would want to replace it anyway for sanitary reasons...especially when you have a little boy.  It's the smallest, most universal travel potty I found.",5
"Manhattan Toy Photo Book, My Stars","We got this to leave with our baby to remember us while he waited for us to return to adopt him internationally. He loved it, much more so than the Sassy one. I don't like that the other is plastic, and wouldn't have purchased it if I knew that leaving a fabric item was ok. There's lift open flaps that make it more engaging. He especially loved the teether moon.",5
Baby Einstein Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym,Very satisfied with the product. Quick delivery! My friend's baby was very happy and entertained. Mommy was also very happy.,5
"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear","Great food storage containers! On the side they even have a scale showing ml, oz so you know how much food is in them. They seal perfectly and they're easy to clean.",5

Prince Lionheart Stove Guard,broke within 2-3 days. the two side sticker don't work properly. The plastic quality is great and the idea is good but the sticker quality is bad,1
Baby Care Play Mat - Pingko Friends (Large),"My 7 month old son sits without support but at times he falls while playing so I wanted a mat which is thick & has good cushioning. This mat is just perfect for that! Since its a one piece mat & not like those tile mats, I can be rest assured that my son won't try to take off the pieces. The other plus point is that it has pictures on both sides. Currently my son is loving the animal pictures side but as he grows older I can use the alphabets & numbers side.Compared to other play mats it is expensive but its totally worth the money spent!The only reason I have given 4 stars for it because at times my son gets too distracted by the pictures and doesn't try to crawl like he does on the bed.",4
"Prince Lionheart Backseat Kick Mat, Black",I have a 2003 Toyota Sequoia (rather large seats) and this product covers the back very well.. it's thick and durable. I love the extra carabiners I hang jackets and stuff from them. I do not feel the the straps that go near my head or near my bum at all.. it fits tightly without ruining the leather.,5
"Bumkins Reusable Sandwich and Snack Bag, Bright Blue, Large","You had me at Seuss. Haven't used the bag yet, so the rating is based on looks alone. As much of life is!",5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 2 month old daughter. She loves it! She plays on it almost daily. The toys are on rings so you can change them out, or in the case of our teething daughter, extend them so she can put them in her mouth. We haven't changed the batteries since we bought it, and she's played on it at least 20 hours. The mat is machine washable, which comes in handy. All in all, best $40 we've spent!",5
The First Years Newborn to Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat,"This feeding seat is very convenient - it stores easily in the closet between grandkid visits and cleans up easily and nicely. Straps to a folding chair securely, which eliminates my concern for spills on my dining room chairs.",5
"Tommee Tippee Storage Lids, 6-Count","love it and glad i bought these lids. I used it after pumping to have bottle ready at nightstand, to store breastmilk in fridge, also to mix formula in bottle (since nipples sometimes leak when shaking), and even on the go to have water ready and secured tight in bottles for formula mixing. good accessory to have on hand if you plan on using tommee tippee bottles.",5
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy",So amazing and easy to wheel around!  I look forward to going on walks with my daughter and I'm very excited to start running with it when I can.,5
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"I ordered 2 of these for Christmas presents this year.  One was a replacement for my 2 yr old's,  The other for a 1 month old.  Good for both ages and beyond",5
"Brica Day and Night Light Musical Mirror, Gray",This mirror for the most part is very good! I love that it is fairly good in size and fits very nicely in car. The only downside is that the light is not very bright so it doesn't help you see the baby any better when it is dark outside. The music is the perfect volume and is very soothing to the baby. I would recommend this product to any new mommy looking for a baby mirror in the car.,4
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,"I read the reviews before purchasing this item and had some concerns from another mothers posting, however I decided to try it for myself and I'm glad I did. I had no problem with it not staying in place, the arm pad is confrotable and my 6 month old son love splashing around. Thank you!",5
"C.R. Gibson Loose Leaf Keepsake Memory Book of Baby's First 5 Years, Welcome Home Noah",Overall I do like the book and the pages. However the binder tabs were uneven and every time you turn the page it tears the page a little. I'm going to get reinforcement stickers for the pages other wise this book won't last. If I could I would probably get the regular book and not the loose leaf.,3
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup, Red and Blue, 9 Ounce, 2-Count","I bought this for my good friend's 2 year old whom I often babysit. He loves it and it is now the only cup he will drink out of. It's a good transition cup as it works almost like a ""grown up"" cup except the liquid comes out slowly depending on how much pressure your child uses with his/her lips. The cup also doesn't spill when tipped over though if and when your child figures out that s/he can use fingers to press down on the top seal to release the liquid, then you may be in trouble...Other pluses include the fact that the cups are dishwasher safe and have relatively few parts (3) to deal with when assembling/disassembling as compared to other sippy cups I have used with my own son a few years back when he was this age.The only minus is that when assembling, it is hard to know when you've got the seal on tightly or correctly; there's no clicking sound or other signal to know you've got it on right, so you have to push it back and if it is not on straight you have to do it again. Not a huge pain but this would be the one thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars.",4

"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman","This was a gift for a great-granddaughter in Ohio, so it was shipped to mommy for her shower.  They love it!

Momma Goose 21 Inch Adult Baltic Amber Necklace (Limone),"I really like this, and i wish there was a way i could get a couple of more inches to be able to use it as a braclet.  I would like to wear it all the time but sometimes it cant be worn as a necklace and that is why i wish i could get an extention so i can wrap it around my wrist one more time so it wont continue to fall off.",5

"Taggies Colours Take A Long Plush, Confetti","Something nice and soft for baby.  has squeaker in the middle. other security blankets feel a bit big; this is a nice size.  although he loves the squeaker, i might've liked it without it because he only can put the edges in his mouth and it isn't quite the same as putting some thin, flexible fabric in his mouth that he soaks with his drool and sucks on; he loves that!  still, it is nice and he likes it.  good seller also.",5
"JJ Cole Car Seat Cover, Khaki","I added this cover to my registry because my baby was due in the winter and I needed to shield her from the cold air.  I could not have gone without it! It is SO easy to put on (or take off) but stays in place really well.  We have used it for almost 3 months and it's still in brand new shape.  I love that when the flap is 'closed', there's still small cracks for air, and I can lift the sides discretely to check on her while we are out.  My daughter happens to love lights while she is awake but when she's trying to sleep, she'll do everything in her power to block light from her face... so this works well for us to be able to have it open or shut depending on what she is doing. I had read some reviews about the baby being too warm under this... personally that was not even close to being an issue for us.  Although it blocks cold air, it's still thin enough that it doesn't smother the baby.  She has never been too warm when we take her out and I have always, always had a blanket over her bottom half under this cover.  I can't say enough good about it!",5
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump - Carry All,"I actually just bought this item off of ebay. I was looking for a new pump beacuse my gerber hand pump had broken. The prcie difference between a new hand pump or an used electric wasn't that much so I started looking. I was actually looking for a medela breast pump, because I didn't know anything about them, but after a little research I decided on ameda, because of the closed plumping. What's this? I didn't know either but apparently it has something to do with the milk actually going through the tubing or not. I didn't like the idea of cleaning tubes and waiting for them to dry out. So I chose ameda. Mine ameda pump is actually an older modal but works great still. I don't use it everyday only a couple of times a week but I think it would work good for everyday use as well.",5

Atlanta Braves Baseball Mobile by Mascotopia,I ordered the Atlanta braves baseball mobile for my first grandchilds reveal party. nd I ordered it early enough to get it in time to wrap it and have it ready from mMonday the 6th party. I came in today the 2nd and was ordered on the 26th. I open the box so excited and it is the KC Royals baseball mobile NOT the Atlanta Braves baseball mobile i ordered. so i had to re order the right one today and paid more in shipping than the item cost in the hopes of getting it by Monday to wrap and give out. i am sure that it wont make it in time and i will have to go out and purchase something else to have something to give that night! How hard is it to pick the right one they dont even look the same. So i am not a happy grandma to be at all!!! I have cried over this. and that is not right!this next one i ordered and paid extra shipping for better be right this time!!!,1
"Graco DuoDiner LX Highchair, Metropolis","These are great high chairs! I shopped around a lot, since I wanted something that would last a while. When you have to buy two of everything, since we have twins, you really want to make sure you're getting a good product. So far they have been super! They are very easy to clean, the trays are easy to get on and off with one hand, and once you get the hang of the straps they are easy to use. The trays are easy to keep clean, but as noted on other reviews, do not fit in a dishwasher. We haven't used the seats separately yet, but they are easy to get on and off. The only complaint I have, and this not necessarily directed at this particular model, the heights don't really go up far enough to make them fit a counter-height table. We couldn't find one that did. They are close, but still just a little too short. They also move very easily, and would benefit from a locking wheel. They are sturdy and not too difficult to put together. I am very happy with them and do not regret my purchase.",5
"Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener, 6 Pack","This doesn't work with outlets that have one screw on top and one on bottom-- it only works for outlets that use one single screw, in the middle between where the two plugs go. The description really should have stated this, because I ordered one for every outlet in my house that my twins can access, and now I can't use them. I also can't return them because I ordered them before we needed them, and didn't think to check on something like this, and it was months before my twins started to crawl and we needed them, and so the return window has passed. Also, the cord shortener is a joke. I had one single outlet in my house that used one screw in the middle, and on it, the cord shortener only shortened a standard lamp cord a few inches. There wasn't room for more cord, and there would certainly never be room for two cords.",1
"green sprouts Stacking Cup Set, Colors may vary","Bought this for my 10 month old daughter and she loves it.  She will play with it either on the floor, but especially likes it in the bath.  Each cup has a different pattern of holes in the bottom, so drains at a different rate and she like to hold them and watch the water fall out.  Hard to believe she has so much fun with such a simple toy - well worth the money!",5
Bummis Fabulous Wet Bags - Medium - Blue,Keeps odors in and doesn't leak. Even when I forgot for a couple of days (we use both disposable and cloth) there was still no smell and it washes very easily and completely clean! I ended up buying another so I could rotate while one was in the wash.,5
Fisher-Price Table Time Turtle Booster,"Very cute, very inexpensive.  All in all, good product.  I love the green turtle theme, which is the reason I bought this in the first place.",5
"Philips AVENT 9 Ounce BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup, 1-Pack, Red","I recomend, good quality, my 18 month year old baby has a very good experience, it took one or two days to get accostum, it is a good option for the transition to a normal cup",5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Forecaster","I purchased this highchair for my second child when the Contempo first came out. I loved the fact that it folds up so small. I was able to fit it in the space between my fridge and my wall very easily. It does take two hands to fold up and sometimes to unfold, but I was able to figure out how to unfold it one handed eventually. It was great for our small house and was easy to clean. It took a bit to figure out how to get the cover off, but once I figured it out it wasn't too bad at all. After taking the cover off I just used my vacuum to pull out the crumbs from some of the crevices and then wiped down with a lysol wipe. It was easy to adjust the height, recline and tray. The only fault I found with it I don't even think is really the highchair's fault. Eventually my daughter was able to figure out where the side release buttons are for the tray so she would randomly pull on them sometimes and end up popping off the tray, but that is when we decided that she was ready to either just sit in a booster at the table or pull the highchair closer to the table without the tray attached.",5
"Comotomo Silicone Baby Teether, Blue","I was looking for a teething toy that had &#34;fingers&#34;, as baby liked to nibble on my fingers.  This works great! It's made of a soft silicone and is easy for baby to hold. I would recommend this.",5
"Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefold, White, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I bought these for a sister who's incontinent. Poise pads and Depends can be quite costly. The incontinence underwear with velcro are not enough to capture all the urine. These Thirsties help significantly capture urine - but are not waterproof. If caught in the right time, these inserts can be changed without having to change a whole outfit. They do take longer to dry in the dryer though.",5
Safety 1st Prograde Finger Pinch Preventer (Pack of 2),"Once my toddlers discovered the fun of opening and closing doors I knew we were in trouble.  I purchased an initial set of these to try them out and they were so helpful in preventing so many finger injuries (more than I can count) that I ended up purchasing multiple packs for many other doors.  The night thing about this design is that when you do want to shut the door you can just hang it on the doorknob, then when you want to use it just put it on the top of the door or somewhere out of reach of your kids.  Definitely a 'must have' for anyone with little ones.",5
Replacement Tubing (Retail Pack of 2) for Medela Pump in Style and New Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump - 100% BPA FREE,I went to BabiesRus and had no luck looking for the replacement tubes. I was so excited when I found out that Amazon had them and it works perfectly for my Medela breast bump that I bought in 2011.,5
Baby Jogger Car Seat Adapter for City Mini / City Elite,Outside of this item not being cheap it works exactly as it should.  It is easy to take on and off the stroller.,5
Munchkin 36 Bath Letters and Numbers,We have a set of these for every bathtub our kids use! They get all over the place but they just love them. They turn bath time into a learning experience as well. Great buy!,5
"CoCaLo Crib Sheet, Daniella","I bought this sheet as a spare to the set I bought for my daughter's nursery. The quality of the cotton is low. They used the lowest thread count possible, so it feels rough and scratchy.It's cute, but the quality is lacking.",3
"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light 2, Black","This travel cot is soooo easy to put up and take down compared to others I have used at friends and in hotels.  It's also so much lighter that the others and seems much more comfortable for your LO as the mattress is padded and sits on the floor, so no thin wooden boards and metal bar.  For us the light weight  was a big plus point as we travel quite a bit.Would definitley recommend paying the extra for this cot if you can afford it.",5
Stephen Joseph Bottle Buddies Shark,My son always wants a water bottle with him.  He absolutely loves this for carrying the bottle.  It seems well made and is a clever idea for kids.,5
"Cosco Apt 40RF Car Seat, Megan","After a doctor visit a couple days ago, I discovered that my 10-month-old daughter is now 27"" long. That means she is already about to outgrow her Graco infant car seat! It was time to start looking at convertible seats for her to upgrade to. After reading several reviews on Amazon, I decided to take a trip to the local Kmart to get a feel for some of the things that reviewers were talking about here. I am glad I did! This model was one that I had already saved on my wishlist for later consideration, and it ended up being on sale at Kmart for $39! I quickly grabbed the last two that they had on the shelf (one for me and one for my wife), and today was the first day using it. So far, I am fairly happy with it, and I will lay out pros and cons later. In brief, however, I would say that this is a good basic car seat for the budget-conscious parent. If I were going to spend the $60 they are asking for here on Amazon, I might choose a different model, but at Kmart's price it was a no-brainer. A few cons make it a 4-star item, and I will come back and edit my review if I find any other problems later on.PROSLight weight. I don't know if that is a huge deal since we are leaving them permanently mounted in our cars, but it is very light weight.Easy install. The directions were very easy to follow, and the manual is laid out in a good logical order. I was able to make all of the fit adjustments and mount the seats in both cars within about an hour.Easy child loading. This seat has a similar concept to the Graco infant seat that we started with. You put the child's arms through the two shoulder straps, then buckle the two metal clips into the crotch strap, then clip the chest clip closed, and finally pull the harness adjuster strap to cinch everything down. This one-strap harness tightening is a genius invention! On our old Graco seat, the shoulder straps had to be individually tightened, and it was difficult to get them adjusted evenly. This one-strap system solves that problem.Cheap price. At the sale price I got at Kmart, this turned out to be the most affordable seat on the market. There were other selling points, but the cost was certainly a factor to consider.One-piece construction. This is nice because the only moving parts are the restraint system. The rest of the seat is one solid piece, which means there are no moving parts to break. This even includes the two cup holders that are molded into it.CONSSize. OK, from what I have read, lots of these convertible car seats are big front-to-back when installed in the rear facing position, so that was to be expected. I had to slightly incline and move forward the passenger seats in both of our vehicles (a 2008 Kia Sorento and a 2003 Dodge Dakota Sport). Aside from that size problem, this seat is also incredibly wide. I suppose some of that has to do with the two cup holders, but the seating area also seems to be excessively wide, especially considering the limitations of the restraint strap positions (which I will talk about next). Even though the seat is supposedly sufficient for infants starting at 5 pounds, I don't know if I would trust it to secure such a small baby.Strange restraint strap positioning. My daughter is currently 20 pounds and 27"" long. Obviously, we have her rear facing and will try to keep her like that until she reaches 40 pounds, but that might be a challenge with the crotch strap. We already have the crotch strap at the middle position, and in rear facing position the manual says the third crotch strap position cannot be used (to leave room for the LATCH belt or seat belt to pass through the shell), and it already seems tight at that position. Time will tell if this will be a problem, but it already looks like the crotch strap is going to get too tight well before she reaches 40 pounds. So, then we will either need to get another seat or turn this one forward facing to use the third crotch strap. So, that will bring up the problem with the shoulder straps! At 27"" tall, my daughter's shoulders are already even with the next-to-last set of holes for the shoulder straps. It is fine if she grows past the last set of holes for rear facing, but the manual says that the shoulder straps should be even with or higher than the child's shoulders for forward facing. Again, time will tell if this things are really problems, but it looks to me like the crotch strap is going to be too small for rear facing and the top strap holes are going to be too low for forward facing. So, she may outgrow this seat sooner than she might outgrow another convertible.Child removal. While putting the child in and cinching down the straps with the one-strap adjustment system is fairly easy, removal is a little more difficult. Because of the shortness of the crotch strap, it is tough to get a good grip on it to push the release button. The straps also seem to be a little difficult to loosen, but that is something that will probably get easier with more use.No mechanical level. There are just lines on a sticker to reference the correct angles to install the seat. It would have been nice if they put actual bubble levels instead of just stickers that force you to ""eyeball"" the angle.Overall, I am happy with the seats for now, but we might end up replacing them sooner than we would another brand.",4
"Imse Vimse Organic Cotton Training Pants, 15-24 months, 24-31 lbs / 11-14 kg WHITE","I bought these after looking at the product in print and wanting solid white.  However what I received was not what I thought I was getting.  They are simply white underwear.  The back of the product says, Not for Nap Time.  Really too bad I did not know this prior.I have a 25 pound toddler who uses the potty 97% of the time but if she is exhaused won't wake up at night and will leak all over the bed.  Just want cloth night time underwear that will protect her just incase, while waking her up with the feeling of wet pants.  Sounds like this is not that product.  (What ever happened to products our Mothers used in the 1970's before Pull Ups?)Since they did not respond to my voicemail messages requesting to know if they sold a different or additional product I would need, I will simply return these. (There 1 email response does not say which product they sell, just that they are not waterproof & would need waterproof pants.)  They should have provided an item number or specify, we do not sell that product. Would have rather exchanged this item or purchased an additional product from them since I am already in an order with them.I did go to a different seller to purchase ""Night Time Training Pants - Waterproof with Xtra Absorbent Padding"".THERE RESPONSE TO HELP YOU BEFORE YOU ORDER PARTIAL PRODUCTS IF YOU NEED MORE OR ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:The product you ordered has no waterproof layer on it, so it may leak through depending on the amount of fluid they don't recommend them to be used overnight. If you are concerned about leaks, using pull on waterproof pants will solve that problem.",2
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"All of my friends had used Diaper Genies so I thought that it was a must have.  In reading online reviews, however, it sounded like the Diaper Dekor Plus was better and boy is it ever!  It's easier to use (it's just like a trashcan - there's no twisting the bag, etc. like you have to do ea time w/the Genie.) Consider 1 for upstairs & 1 for downstairs too.",5
"Bumkins Flushable Diaper Liner, Neutral, 100 Pack","These were great when I was trying to talk my husband into cloth diapers. Not that my sons are older, their #2's are more predictible so we can use these more sparingly. Happy so far",5
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet, Celery",I'm giving these one star because they had a terrible chemical odor which seemed to come from the toxic vinyl packaging.  Even after two washes we could smell it. They went in the trash.  We will use the BabyBjorn brand sheet.  It is soft and has no odor.For those wanting these for the BabyBjorn travel crib.  We purchased two because other reviewers indicated they fit. We found them to be too small and did not safely cover the entire mattress without pulling up at the sides.,1
"Kolcraft Cozy Soft Portable Crib Mattress, Lily",After reading some reviews i decided to take a chance and order this. So glad I did.  I really like it and it seems to be good quality.  Not to soft and not rock hard like the piece of foam that comes with alot of the portable/mini cribs.  It fits in my crib nice and snug and right up against the rails.  Now all I need is for my little guy to get here.,5
Plum Organics Training Meals - Harvest Vegetable with Turkey,I should've read the other review before buying this.  The rosemary flavor was too overwhelming even for my palate.  What a waste to part with the rest of the box.,1
"Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, Green/Blue","This is the same price as the Fisher-Price Healthy Deluxe Booster Seat and looks the same, and I bought it thinking that it was the same. Do yourself a favor and buy Item model number BMD97 instead of this one. The BMD97 model has a removable snap-on tray that you can stick in the dishwasher, and a removable snap-on lid to keep the tray clean when you travel with it, it is also height-adjustable. This one is not.",2
"Baby Deedee Sleep Nest Baby Sleeping Bag, Dream Blue, Small (0-6 Months)",This is a great solution for a baby who moves a lot is a his/her sleep (practically for all babies). It keep a baby warm without restricting too much his/her movements. It is easier to put on and take off compared to other similar products due to shoulder snaps.,5
"Chicco Polly Double Pad Fabric Highchair, Manhattan","We love this chair!  It is the sturdiest we've seen and we have been very happy with it.  The five-point harness is a must and the adjustability is great. You can make it skinny for storage, as well.  Ours has fabric on the seat, but it is pretty washable and still looks great.  The extra tray tops area handy for taking places for our son to eat ""finger food"", but at home I take them off, since it is actually easier to clean up with just the large tray on.  The only thing I was upset over was that after we owned it 6mo., the harness buckle broke, leaving me with an unsafe seat for a squirming baby.  I contacted the company and was sent a new harness free of charge.  They were good about it, but -come-on do they only expect your baby to use it for a little while and then it can start breaking! Frustrating!",4
Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,I was so excited to finally see a humidifier that all the parts can go into the dishwasher. That is the only good part. I ordered two and neither puts out the 1.5 gallons every day of water both the humidifier and the filters claim it does. I'm lucky to get a half gallon every 36 hours out of it. I have them running full time and have replaced the filters 3 times. NOTHING WORKS. Very disappointed.,1
"Mary Meyer Baby Cheery Cheeks Soft Toy, Moo Moo Cow","I purchased Cheery Cheeks, Tails the Monkey in the hopes that my 10mth old daughter would use it as a cuddly comforter. She is now 13mths old and it is her best friend and sleeps with her daily. Best purchase I have made. I have bought 2 and I am now purchasing my 3rd as a back up for when the others are dirty & in the wash.The only negative I have is that the material on the front is a bit thin and is wearing very quickly from regular use. But in saying that my baby girl would crawl everywhere with it. She is now walking so it may not wear as quick.Overall a very soft, amazingly cute cuddly toy that my daughter adores.",5
Kidswitch Light Switch Extender- 3 Pack,I liked having an extension on the switch going down the stairs so that kids don't have to lean out over the stairs to turn the light on and off.  This one works very well for turning lights off - but the flimsy design makes turning the lights on a bit more tricky.  My 2 years old has it figured out now - but it took a couple of months.  While I don't think this design is ideal - I haven't been able to find anything better yet.,4
Levana BABYVIEW20 Interference Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby Camera,so far this baby monitor has extremely clear picture even the night view at night vision is clear the sound quality is impeccable and the lullabies and additional night light make an excellent add onsI'm planning on ordering a second for our other child,5
Bright Starts Grab and Stack Blocks,My 6 month old received these soft blocks for Christmas this year and LOVES them.  He had played with a more expensive version and liked those we well.  These blocks are a better value than the 30 dollar version.  He enjoys stacking them up and knocking them down.  I am going to purchase another set!,5
"Baby Trend High Chair, Maximilian","So I haven't needed a highchair in a while. From what I can remember from my other kids, they made them a lot stronger. This one does the job but is kind of rough when changing positions from recliner to straight back, etc. Times have changed and the products have gotten more expensive but the material has gotten cheaper. Got to love it.",3
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom",LOVE the pan and tilt feature. We had a Samsung but our toddler moved out of view (now that she is in a big girl bed) all the time. Love the pan and tilt feature of this monitor.,5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","It's sturdy if you follow the directions it is easy to secure to a chair. My daughter has adjusted well, she seems comfortable and that's what matters the most to me.",5
"Stokke Tripp Trapp Highchair, Red",Lasts for years and years.  Usable with almost all age groups.  Would recommend not using with infants who aren't able to sit well on their own.  Even with the belt and the infant railing it isn't very comfortable for the littlest ones.  Superb products for older infants up to young children and doesn't make your dining room look like a baby factory.,5
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow EZ Clean High Chair,"My baby love it, although it took me long time to put them together. It is in good quality. I am satisfied with the service.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I was a little hesitant to purchase this item due to the other reviews.  It seems to be working well so far.  I am using it at daycare for my two year olds nap time.  We did have to put a blanket on top of it to make it softer.  So far, so good.",4
"NoJo Emily Reversible High Chair Cover, Pink/Brown",I love the fact that it is two sided because I get to use it a lot more.  it is easy to clean and it's super cute!,5
Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobile,Mobile fits description exactly and worked perfectly right out of the box.  It is nothing too fancy which is why it is such a great deal.  Does the job and hope to get at least six months use out of it.  Will update if anything changes.  Definitely can't go wrong with this choice for $27.,4
"Safety 1st OnSide Air Protect Convertible Car Seat, Adeline Black","Sturdy, easy to setup in our Altima and easy to secure baby.  Had to buy a protector seat cover and think such a device should be sold with the seat.",5
"Blueberry Trainers Pants, Pink, Large","These training pants are essentially very thick, absorbent undies.MATERIAL:  The fabric is very, very soft and feels high-quality.  The stretchy waist and leg openings are also very soft, not binding or itchy.  The inner layer is almost fleecy/fuzzy, but it doesn't pill like fleece does.  The colors do not fade.  The photo is very accurate -- these are a mint-green color with chocolate brown trim.ABSORBENCY:  These are halfway between underwear and diaper.  There is no waterproof layer, but since they are thicker than undies, they can hold a bit of moisture.  A little pee dribble will stay contained, but the child will feel wet.  A full-on pee will soak the training pants and run onto the floor.  So, be prepared -- don't let your kid wear these on Grandma's fancy sofa unless you are very, VERY confident.FIT:  These fit great.  I would say that they run true to size or a little bit small.  If in doubt, definitely size up.",5
Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy,I bought this for my daughter to use on her umbrella stroller and it works as described.,4
"timi &amp; leslie Hannah 7-Piece Diaper Bag Set, Pewter","I LOVE this bag!  Lots of pockets and storage space.  I carry A LOT with five kiddos and feel like this really does the job.  It doesn't feel too heavy even when loaded down.  I love the outside pockets, I use them for hand sanitizers, my phone, lipstick, tissues, keys.  They really hold a lot.  I used them once for a sippy cup but prefer to keep that inside the bag now.  The changing pad is lightweight but large enough baby at 8 months still stays completely on the pad.  The only thing is when this bag is loaded at all,the top strap that hangs over the top with the circle does not go over the bag so it just hangs there, unable to close.  I'm not sure why they designed it this way, its odd and unusable.  But I love the hobo style and I love the stroller straps.  It's a big bag without being HUGE.  I can tend to overpack so this helps me keep it more reasonable.  I really love the pewter because I feel like it matches all my clothing whether I'm wearing black, white, brown, summer, winter, whatever! :)",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I absolutely love ALL Avent products... their bottles, bottle-warmer, pacifiers, etc.Both of my boy used the Avent bottles, and the ones my first-born used are still being used by my second one. Yes, sometimes there is a slight leak when shaking... I found that is from formula powder getting stuck between the nipple and the bottle, and breaking the seal. So, when it happens I just wipe the rim of the bottle, take the nipple out of the ring, rinse the nipple and ring, and then the problem's gone. These bottle seem virtually indestructible to me, and haven't discolored with age of anything. (Although, old nipples do discolor.)It's hard to believe my mom gave me bottles with little bags in side... what a pain and mess that must have been!!!",5
"Dream On Me Classic 2 in 1 Convertible Stationary Side Crib, Cherry","Although it is a lightweight crib, nice quality, better than I expected. Very sturdy and I liked the metal spring bottom support for a mattress.  I did not use the wheels. Easy to put together.",5
"Baby Trend Sit N Stand DX Stroller, Vanguard","We purchased this for our infant daughter and 3yo because sometimes both kids need a lift or a ride. I can fold it and place into the back of our SUV with no problems. I cannot do it with one hand, but no double I tried out would do that. (I tried out each one at the store!) It is the most compact and lightest of the double-strollers that I found. It takes up most of the back of our small SUV, so not much else will go in unless it can be stacked on top of the stroller. It is tall enough for my husband, who is over 6ft, to be comfortable pushing it. The stroller is sturdy and easy to push. There is room for a small/medium diaper bag in it. It is funny that there are so many cup-holders (5!), but kids always find something to put in them other than drinks.CONS: The shade doesn't block too much sun, but it is sufficient. The straps to the seat in back get tangled if you try to put anything in the basket underneath or if your kid turns forward-facing in the seat. These 2 minor things are why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star rating.We are happy with our purchase.",4
"Carter's Butterfly Flowers 4 Piece Receiving Blanket, Pink/Choc, 30 X 40&quot;","As usual this is a great Carter's product.  The size is great....30X40 instead of the more frequent 30X30. Very soft and very cute. Have not washed or used these yet as baby is still 10 wks away.  However, with this being baby number 3 I have had a lot of blankets and a lot of Carter's products.  These seem to be great.  Would give 5 stars if I knew how well they handle the wash.",4
Cosco Scenera Convertible Car Seat Black,It functions as a car seat but is not comfortable.  It is hard plastic with a thin cover over it.,3
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,"I wanted to love this product - it seemed like the perfect solution to my daughter constantly chewing on the crib rail.  However, it just would not stick to our crib.  We followed the directions and made sure the surface was clean and it stuck on the top but would not stay stuck on the sides.  We bought the Trend Lab cribwrap rail cover and that ties on so it stays on much better.",2
"Playtex Baby Replacement Bottom Straws (for the Playtex QuickStraw, The Insulator Sport, Create My Own, and Baby Einstein Straw Cups): 3 Pack",Love these sippy cups but finding the replacement straws....for those that melted in the bottom of the dishwasher :P is almost impossible!! ( I do wash these precious straws by hand now!) And then shipping costs as much - or more - than the straws!! They got us by the short hairs!,5
Fisher-Price Power-Plus Plug-In Swing - Best Friends,"I bought this because of the plug-in feature.  I have theGraco Lovin Hug Easy Entry Open Top/Curved Frame Swingthat I like much better.  This Fisher Price swing is very slow even on the highest setting and if a blanket falls and touches the ground, it stops the swing completely!  It also has a post between the baby's legs and it doesn't recline very far, so it isn't great for having the baby nap in.  The seat itself is not very large - my two month old's legs are already sticking off of it.  It was only $80 here, so I didn't waste my money, but if Graco made a plug-in swing, I would surely get that instead.  I have an older Fisher Price swing with similar styling and I like the Graco much better than both of them!",3
"Fisher-Price Musical Mobile, Rainforest Peek-a-Boo Leaves","Colorful, musical, action mobile.  The figures face the baby instead of the colorful part facing upward toward the adults. Very pleased with the price.",5
Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,"We love our Mobi.  The kids liked the name Mobi from what they saw on the box so that is the name that stuck.  We just purchased our second light.  The first one lasted us for about 3 1/2 years and finally stopped charging.  There wasn't any way to replace the battery, so we had to lay the first one to rest.  That being said, Mobi has been used every night.  He has gone on vacation with us, Girl Scout camping trips, visiting family etc.  My kids argue over which color we are going to set him on.  It has a feature that has it lit up for 15 minutes than dims off but my kids like to leave it on all night and it is typically still on when they wake up in the morning and we pop it back on the charger to ready itself for the next night.  It was a great asset for those late night bathroom trips because they can just grab it and go and it lights up the room well.  It also wipes off easily which is a great thing for a slightly over obcessive germ phobic Mom like me!",5
Rockin' Green Classic Rock Lavender Mint Revival 45oz,Purchased this soap because of the fact we were cloth diapering our son and this soap is supposed to strip ammonia from the cloth diapers.  This product did not strip the diapers well and our son ended up getting a bad rash from the ammonia buildup,1
Bedtime Originals Hello Kitty and Puppy Window Valance - Pink,"I love this, I chose to put it in my kitchen its pink and green my kitchen is in a lime green so it goes very good with it :)",4
"Infantino Union Ergonomic Carrier, Gray","I tried using this with both my two-month old baby girl and my two-and-a-half year old niece. This review is based on these tests.This carrier worked very well for my niece. I carried her on my back using the unit. She fit in it very well: it was snug, secure, and she felt very comfortable. She was smiling as she was being carried in it. I felt pretty comfortable with her on my back, although it wasn't something I would have wanted to have done for longer than an hour.We then tried it on my daughter who was a little over 8 pounds at the time. I carried her on my front using the carrier. It didn't work very well for her. We never quite got it to fit properly and comfortably. Because she was so small, she couldn't wrap her legs around me, which meant she couldn't sit comfortably in the carrier. Because of this, she kept wanting to squat, which meant that it always felt like she was ready to pop out at any time. My wife also noticed that it was difficult to place her in it properly while she was screaming and crying. Also, our impression was that a baby that small also just kind of gets lost in the carrier.Generally, this carrier is sturdy, convenient, and comfortable for both adult and (older) baby, and my wife and I plan on using it more as our daughter gets older. However, like other reviewers, we just don't feel it is the best carrier for smaller babies.",4
Safety First Microban Protected Nap Mat,just perfect for my lil guy.He starts kindergarden this year and was hard to find in the stores.So quick and easy on line.,5
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler",It's easy to set up. The quality is good and sturdy. My husband and I love the color and the softness of the fabric. Can't wait for our baby to born to enjoy this!,5
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"We love the swing. Bought 2 for our twins, they're 8 months old and still using them. There are 2 things I would change: it needs a vibrating seat or at least the option to turn on something vibrating. And I wish the seat could turn in both directions. We have limited space and have them side by side, would be nice to be able to turn the seats so that the kids can face each other. Other than that, the best investment we made for our sanity. :)",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I love the Diaper Champ - it makes diaper changes quick and easy. We make sure to wrap up all the dirty wipes in the dirty diaper before depositing it, so it doesn't get stuck in the shoot. Each time the bag is full, we empty the pail, spray Lysol inside and out, and replace the bag. We've had it for almost 3 months now, and can't complain.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","my daughter loves her new backpack, and I love these colors as they aren't to girly but still bright and fun.",5
"Mimi the Sardine Coated Organic Cotton Splashmat, Jungle","Big enough to fit under the baby's chair, easy to clean (machine wash warm, tumble dry low or hang dry), fun pattern for either boy or girl.  I was concerned about a plastic mat tearing when the dog walks on it or chairs pull on it, but with this mat there's no worry.  It's cloth so no plastic smell either.  Very happy with this product.",5
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),These are super cheap and feel great on your scalp. You should buy them right now! Do it I tell you!,5
"Evenflo AMP High Back Car Seat Booster, Pink Angles","I did not do as much research before purchasing as I have in the past on car seats and I did not realize there was no latch. I am not a huge fan of relying on the seatbelt alone but as another reviewer pointed out- it's a booster, it is meant to lift them up enough to use the seatbelt like everyone else. My daughter loves her seat, says she is comfortable, and the assembly was easy. The one star I didn't give is simply because the latch would make me feel like she is extra secure. She is old enough for it, reaches all of the requirements, but I still feel she is so little and would go flying without that extra support! Silly mom concerns, the seatbelt is capable of keeping her safe but there is no harm in a little extra!It is a good price, a solid seat and looks like it will be super easy to clean!",4
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe WrapSack Blanket, Sketchy Sport, Large","I had previously purchased a Stage 2 SwaddleMe and loved it. Material was sturdy yet soft and I got a nice tight swaddle using it. Unfortunately my little man grew out of the small at 12lbs. I read other reviews that the large was sized very big so I opted for the new SwaddleMe Wrap Sack since little man could transition to arms out, bonus!Highly disappointed with this purchase. The material is light, but very rough and ""cheap"" feeling. Not soft at all. I bought the small because other reviewers said it ran big-- WOW that is an understatement. With a 12lb baby I could not safely fasten the Velcro and have a tight swaddle, the material bunched up around his body and neck. I woke up to him throwing a fit and he had wiggled both hands to the top opening and pulled the material up over his mouth/nose in the process!! I am returning this ASAP.I gave 2 stars simply because I liked the bottom zipper for easy diaper changes, but what good is that if your baby can pull the loose swaddle over their face.I have purchased from Amazon for two years and never cared to leave a review until now. When it comes to choosing products for the most important thing in your life, safety is first and foremost.",2
GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Blue 5 Pack,"I love this so much more than the Soothie.  It's so much lighter than the Soothie so when it falls out, it doesn't wake up my son like the Soothie.  Also, it doesn't over up my son's face like the ugly Soothie.  The only negative thing about this is that it still leave marks on my son's cheek, but this might be because my son has extra large chipmunk cheeks.",4
Boppy Water Resistant Protective Cover,"I bought this in order to protect my Boppy pillow from wetness and stains.  I had used it without any problems for the last few weeks, but today my baby had a poop leak out of his diaper while he was nursing, and the poop stain went through to the Boppy pillow, even though I was using this water resistant slipcover.  I would have expected more protection from it.",2
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot","Great price, loved the nice selection of styles. I bought in the light blue stripe. In retrospect maybe I should have gone for a darker pattern because with all the handling it started to look dirty pretty soon. But I sprayed with shout and out through the wash and it came out looking brand new. The clip stays on any kind of clothing and does not seem to bother my 6 week old baby at all.",5
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Flannel fitted Crib Sheet, Ecru","I ordered this sheets because my 5 month old kept waking up as we laid her in the crib - bc her sheets were too cold. Someone suggested getting flannel sheets. It worked like a charm. I would recommend and this is a quality sheet, too. Some other sheets I ordered around the same time, i wasn't so pleased with (terry cloth). I didnt even wind up using the others.",5
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Cuddle Cove Rocking Seat, Winslet","I sure would tell any one about this, It every thing one would need to start out with. 5 stars",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","I bought the Bumble Bee for my 12 month old. I was tired of lugging around a huge diaper bag and this seemed like the perfect solution.Besides being super cute to look at, it has great features. There is a place to write your child's name inside, a pocket for a bottle or juice cup, and an insulated front section.In the main section I can fit two changes of clothes, five diapers, and wipe case with room to spare. On the outside pocket I can fit two pacifiers, two juice boxes, snacks, diaper cream, and a travel size powder.Skip Hop makes awesome gear! I am a huge fan! They never disappoint.",5
"Evenflo Journey 300 Stroller with Embrace 35 Car Seat, Koi",when i receive this product was bronken the front plastic part.That's my only concern.Thank you so much for asking about it.,3
"dexbaby Safe Sleeper Convertible Crib Bed Rail, White","My twin boys stay nice and secure in their beds now and can easily get in and out of their converted cribs. The only difficult part of the installation was securing the screws and wing nuts. The screws aren't quite long enough and don't properly align.  We took off the brackets and bent them a bit to allow for the screws to fit to the wing nuts.  It wasn't a big deal, but could have been designed better.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",I recently attended a baby shower and gave this as a gift.  The mother had requested a couple of these.  Since then she has given birth and this sheet has been working well for her.  Great idea for a baby shower gift.,5
Tupperware Shape O Ball Toy,"This is a &#34;tactile learning toy&#34; that my children played with over 40 years ago.  My daughter specifically requested the Shape-O Ball for her daughter, who is only 7 months old, but is getting acquainted with it now.The primary colors are vivid and eye-catching.The shapes are too big to swallow, and have no sharp edges, and they each fit only in the specific opening.It doesn't talk, does not require batteries, and is very durable--a nearly perfect toy!",5
"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Taila","We love the pattern.  The seat is comfortable & my daughter enjoys riding in it.  Easy to transfer from car to car.  Lightweight.  Cup holders work the best of any car seat we've had so far.  Does not recline much, so her head droops when she sleeps (hope to fix this with a pillow.)",5
"UPPAbaby G-Lite Stroller, Denny/Red","This is a great umbrella stroller.  It is light and our guy was very comfortable in it.  We purchased it specifically for an international vacation where we wanted a high quality, light stroller.  The sun shield is great and while the basket isn't huge, it was a great size for everything we needed for baby and a few souvenirs.  Love that it stands when it is folded.  And we really like the red color.The reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it takes 2 hands to open, which is tough when you're going through airport security or wherever you are and you can't put baby down.  If you've got help, you're fine, but that's a pain.  Also, when we gate checked it, it came back to us pretty beat up and doesn't really stand on it's own very well anymore.  I'm not sure if that's because the stroller is a little delicate or whether I blame the airline, but just thought i'd mention to be carefull.  All in all we like it and will continue to use it.  Just wish you could open it with one hand!",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube Kids Musical Toy,"This review is from: Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube Kids Musical Toy (Baby Product)This is heavy and appropriate for babies starting under a year old. Each side plays a unique instrument, so a baby can learn to distinguish those different sounds.The sound quality is beyond expectations, it is so good. You have to stay on top of changing the batteries. In fact, start buying all sizes of batteries in large discount containers as so many toys use batteries.The toy is heavy. I don't think that's a problem. The corners are rounded and my kids didn't throw it or bang it on things (maybe because it's heavy but not sure why they didn't do those things).There is a natural progression of toy from this one. From here once they're just a little older, you can get the Fisher Price unit that has so many knobs and keys that play different tunes. And so on.In other words, this toy is actually among the first group in a series of toys that play tunes. Babies like this toy, I know because of my own kids.",4
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"We have had this kick and play since my daughter was born. She is now 8 months old. She still enjoys playing with it. She does not always want to sit in it now, but she will sit on the floor next to it and play. We used it plenty when she was an infant. This will say in our collection for the next child.",4
Lamaze Soft Chime Garden Musical Toy,My daughter loves this toy.  She loves the music and lights and is now 5 months old and is starting to understand how to &#34;hit&#34; it to make the music play.  I can hang it over her on her activity mat or put it in front of her when she's on her stomach.  It works wonderfully and was worth the purchase.,4
"Summer Infant Highlands Conversion Kit, Mocha",Works great and my little man loves it. Didnt take long to change out either. Would do it againand the price was good.,5
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","The Diaper Genie Elite is much improved from earlier models.  It is taller than the older model which makes it much easier to reach into it, but the best thing about it is that there is a foot pedal that opens the diaper genie, making it possible to insert a diaper with one hand.  This is great when you are trying to keep a wiggly baby from rolling off the changing table!It went together fairly easy, although we had a bit of an issue getting the top and bottom parts to fit together well.  We were left with a slight gap but it is not noticeable and doesn't seem to affect it at all.We were hoping odor control would be even better with this new Diaper Genie, but it is about the same as the old model.  You would not want to put this anywhere that someone may have to sit close to it, but it is fine in the nursery and the odor is not noticeable until you pop the top to put in another diaper.We have been using this for about 4 weeks and are just now needing to put in a refill so the value per refill seems to be good.",4
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","Good quality, enough said there. I also bought Dr Brown's bottle brush, it's pretty flimsy, for washing the pump bottles and gadgets because this brush is too big for standard neck opening bottles.",5
"Bright Starts Baby's Play Place Playmat, Swingin' Safari","Good product, not sure it's really worth the money though. I would say that this did meet my expectations though.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Waterfall Peek-a-Boo Soother,"I received mine second-hand from a friend.  It was in a box with some other items and when I first got it out to clean and set up on my son's crib my hand came out wet...the fluid had leaked out around the battery compartment.  Not sure about the safety of the fluid either since it smelled very strongly of chemicals and the consistency was greasy feeling...it's definitely not plain water.  Never trusted it to use after that, regardless of how cute it is.",3
"GroVia Cloth Wipes, 12 count","LOVE these wipes... So soft, durable and thick! I bought this pack as a gift because I love them so much. They are probably 3xs as thick as those cheap baby washcloths you find in the store. Even great for personal use. I have also tried the organic Grovia wipes and these are still my fave. Organics are more fleecy where these are terry. The organics are soft to the touch as well but don't get in to the nooks and crannies as well. They also dont fold up as well as these which is something you look for when you're wiping.",5
"Mud Pie Ornament, Snowman","The Mud Pie Snowman Ornament is a fun, whimsical ceramic ornament that is simple but well made. Just be sure and don't drop it because it is ceramic and will break.",4
"Carters Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover, Chocolate","if you've never felt this material, it is the best when it comes to soft comfort and durability. you can wash it a million times and it will look the same.this item also fits smaller changing pads like the ones that come in furniture. I have used it with a large ""scooped"" type pad on top of a dresser and with an attached changing table. all you have to do is tuck the excess under the pad and it looks fine. just fyi.",5
Baby Trend Universal Double Snap-N-Go Stroller Frame,It is a good solution for twins,5
"Pearhead Babyprints Modern Wall Frame, Natural",We have this in the baby's nursery and love it. It was fairly easy to use. I read the reviews ahead of time and used olive oil so sticking wasn't a problem. We ended up with extra &#34;clay&#34; stuff so have 2 extra feet.,4
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Captain Calamari",Mr. Calamari ohh how I love this toy! The little ball helps my son go to sleep in the car it's a lifesaver !!! It's a very entertaining  toy for my son.,5
Navitech Blue Faux Leather Case / Cover With Stand For The Lenovo Ideapad S5000,"I love the case; it has not only done the job of protecting my electronic device, but it is a very attractive looking case that draws great attention to it's appearance.  The leather is real and the color of the case is a &#34;true&#34; purple.  I would recommend this case to anyone who has a 7&#34; Lenovo tablet.  It fits in all the right places (where openings are needed, they are there) as well as being attractive.  One of the best buys I have made from Amazon!",5
Two 26&quot; Pink Flamingo Party Decoration Yard Ornaments,I have flamingos all around the house guarding it.  These are a really nice replacements for those that are ready for retirement.,5
The First Years Clean Air Filter Replacement 2 pk,Love my diaper pail's functionality and these filters really help with the smell.  This particular pail and filter is much easier to use than many of its counterparts.,5

myBaby SoundSpa Portable,We needed a small sound machine for our 4 month-old son and this one looked promising. He sleeps so soundly when we use it and it's great if you travel too. Price was right and we're happy with everything so we'll definitely recommend this product in the future.,5
Triple 8 FLO Diaper Sprayer,"This thing is pretty awesome. It makes cleaning cloth diapers a breeze. It was definitely a pain to install, but this was due to my toilet more than the product. I watched their installation video online and it was really straightforward and simple. If you're uncertain because of the reviews, I would highly recommend it.",4

"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Bag Refill, 36 Bags",I agree with all the other reviewers that this seller is way overpriced. I made the mistake of thinking I was getting a bulk product but received only one package. What a rip off!,1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","I chose this product bc baby sleeps with loud white noise (we have the hammacher schlemmer brand) and it has a loud volume option for white noise. At first I was so excited to use it. After 3 nights of leaving it on all night long on the loudest white noise setting, it crapped out.  It would only play the white noise at a &#34;whisper&#34; level. I breathe louder than it played. Since that was the main feature I needed, its now sitting in a box.",1

SoHo Monkey Savannah Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,This product has a bad quality paint color.The first wash time has a permanent damage in colors. The appearance is terrible. This is not a product that I can recommend for your baby bed!,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Rainforest","We live in a very small apartment, so we started stressing when it was time to get our daughter a high chair.  This one is just right for us.  Our daughter really likes the toys and they're set up in such a way that we can feed her without taking the toy tray off. The only downside of that is that there are stickers, so when I was wiping the toys off I saw them start to wrinkle.  Also, the chair is a little small.  My baby's 7 months old but a preemie, and the tray is almost at her chunky legs.  If she was full-term size, she would probably be uncomfortable.  But it is nice and wide.We're happy with it, and so is the baby, which is the most important part.",5
Fresh N Freeze 2 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 12-Pack,"If you want only the best you can provide for your baby to eat, it only makes sense to have the safest, best way to store the food you prepared for the week containers....  Recommend you purchase together and feed only the freshest for you child.  My granddaughter and great-nephew enjoy it all and are enjoying it all! :-)",5
Bouche Baby Take N' Shake Baby to Toddler Feeding Gift Set,"I don't have kids of my own but I am an aunt (7 nieces and nephews) and typically I only volunteer to feed them when their at home.  On the go with formula is usually way too stressful for me (screaming kid, messy mixing/dropping/clumpy drink that doesn't get all the food in).  But when I was handed a baby and this different colourful bottle, I was assured it would be easy and it was.  Unscrew, flip, screw, shake, feed.  Why did it take this long for someone to make this!!? This is now the gift I'm giving all the moms I know - apparently it's also easy to clean and it turns into a sippy cup when kids move into that stage. Basically the gift that keeps on giving.",5
Phil Teds Classic Stroller with Double Kit - Black,"The stroller strolls great, but once my kids were near the weight limit (my younger one was 23lbs in the back and older was 35 in the front--weight limit is 33 in back and 50 in front), the stroller was harder to maneuver.THIS IS NOT A TRUE JOGGER.  It is far too heavy even when our little ones were only 14lbs and 26lb.  It is hard to control with only one hand.Hoods are helpful only when the sun is coming from the back--otherwise, they don't shift in different positions.The under basket is completely useless when you have the toddler seat attached to the back--forget about getting things in and out of there when you have a baby who is sleeping and you don't want to disturb or when the second baby is kicking you.  The basket is also a bit hard to reach when the stroller is set to newborn carriage (flat position) and the toddler is clipped to the front.  Usually, our baby was asleep and you would really have to reach to get to what you needed in the basket.Don't even think about strapping on your diaper bag on the handlebars when you have more than one child--either it hits the newborn in the flat position or constantly right in front of the toddler in the rear seat.Reclining is also useless if there is a second child in the back.  The child in front can only recline so much before they are invading their younger sibling's space.  Also, the rear can recline but only about 5 degrees more than the upright position.The stroller was a bit more functional once we bought the extras--the panier bags so that we can store kids things without using the under basket, the double sun cover so that they had sun protection, the hang bag so that we can quickly store cups and the food tray so that our child in front can snack while we were out.  It is just annoying because of the money you spend, you would think they would think of these little conveniences.In the end, I wish I would have spent an extra $100-150 to get the higher end models--the vibe.  At least with the vibe, you can fold the stroller with both seats attached as opposed to having to remove the second seat to fold down.  The higher end models also had sun hoods that were more retractable and can move to fully protect.  The higher end models also had more comfortable seats because it comes with the standard cushy pad.",2
"Dream On Me Jessica Changing Table, Cognac",Was easy to put together! The pad it comes with is not very thick but we had an extra one we put in it! Great deal for the price we paid.,4
North States Superyard 3 in 1 Wood Gate,This gate works wonderfully to keep my 13 month old son from climbing up onto the fireplace and I love that it can be flexed into any position so that we can also block the electrical outlet nearby! Plan on using this gate to protect our Christmas tree as well. My son even tried pulling the gait down and it did not tip! Would recommend this gate to anyone!,5
Baby Trend Universal Double Snap-N-Go Stroller Frame,"Light easy to carry , assemble and use. Recommended for a lower cost safe easy solution for people on the go with twins!",5
"BABYBJORN Spoon 2 Pack, Red/Blue","My 1 year old son loves these spoons. They are comfortable for him to hold, are the perfect length for him to put the spoon in his mouth, and are the perfect thickness for his little hands. The bowl/plate rest notch on the back of the handle is ingenious! He is happy at meal times when I give him his spoon to practice feeding himself with. I would highly recommend these spoons!",5
"Dreambaby Children at Play Sign, Orange","I went online looking for the Step 2 Safety Guys and saw these.  At less than half the price and with such good reviews, I thought I'd give them a chance.They work wonderfully.  I bought two brick pavers at Home Depot (one for each sign) for less than a dollar.  I put one at each end of the area where my kids are playing in the middle of the street (so that drivers have to slow to go around it.)They work wonderfully.  Highly recommended.",5

"green sprouts Wide Neck Feeding Bottle, 8 Ounce",Poorly designed bottle.  Nipple collapses easily and caused my baby to have extreme gas.  Didn't think bottles could be this bad.  I recommend getting Dr. Browns.,1
Britax Back Seat Mirror,I have no idea how this has such good reviews.  All I did was open up the box and look at it and I am returning it.  This huge mirror is a huge piece of plastic and very heavy.  If this were to fall on a baby it would do some serious damage.  I cannot imagine what would happen with this in a car accident.  Scary.  I will be buying a lightweight cloth one instead.,1
Fisher-Price Sensory Selections Bouncer,I did a lot of research and settled on this one.It is very colorful and has a mobile.It has a lot of activities and music too.The seat is very comfy too.My baby loved and used it from about 2 months to 6months.,5
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Newborn Napper Station DLX, Jacqueline",I gave this pack n' play as a baby shower gift. The soon to be mother was so excited! Her exact words were &#34;I've never seen a pack n play like this in my whole life; this is awesome!!&#34;  It shipped very quickly and got to her just in time! It has so many functions especially for someone that doesn't have a ton of space. Plus the colors and patterns are adorable.,5

"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella","As others have said, it's a sturdy, cheap (in price) carseat that works just fine. We use it as the extra for my husband's car and haven't had problems, except for getting the straps twisted around. But that's my husband's fault thought for not being able to look at the buckles, before twisting them around a million times.",4

Microplush Fitted Crib Sheet (2) Pale and Dark Pink,"These are keeping my skinny mini of a daughter nice and warm at night!  She has no fat of her own to keep her warm. ;)  They don't fit perfectly, like other reviewers say, but they're functional.  It's not like they come off the mattress on their own-- THAT would be a big problem.  The problem of having to tug them back down (only on the lengthwise side-- the short ends of the sheet cover the short end of the mattress fine) is just annoying, but not a big deal in my book.",4
"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer","I have to say I was nervous every time I bathed my baby girl.  I personally love hot baths, so many times the water seemed too cold.  My husband is the opposite, so he would say it was always too hot.  I'm sure this happens to many new parents.  The turtlemeter has given me comfort that the water is fine for my baby and she loves to play with it while she bathes.  It's a win win.",5

While they are super comfortable to wear, the cork footbed is very drying to the feet, especially the heels. I've used many lotions and body butters on my heels to try and moisturize them, but none have done quite as nice of a job helping my heels as this Shea Butter.This raw and unrefined version is quite different than any other shea butter product I've used in the past. It's much thicker and a small amount goes a long way. Once the shea butter warms up with your body temperature it can then be smoothed into the skin. It's quite nice and I can't say I've ever used anything like it before. If you know someone who enjoys products that are 100% all natural, or is sensitive to products that are made with added perfumes or dyes, than this raw African Shea Butter would be a great gift idea for them.A sample was provided for review.",4

"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","The look and design of this changing table is delicate, soothing and very, very pretty. The drawers and spaces are functional and of a good size. It's not complicated to assembly, but yes, it does require a couple of hours. Instructions are clear and easy to follow. It says it requires two people to put it together, but my husband did it by himself. We didn't have any problem with shipping or damaged parts... everything arrived as it was supposed to be. It looks very gorgeous along with our baby's white crib and other furniture pieces. It does not seem cheap at all; all parts are sturdy and well-made. YOU HAVE MY RECOMMENDATION here.",5
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe Adjustable Infant Wrap, 3-Pack, Mom &amp; Baby","The very first night I used one of these swaddle sacks with my baby, she quietly went to bed and stayed that way far longer then she ever had before. She did protest a little at first, but now starts to settle down when I start wrapping her. I find I really have to square her shoulders to the sewn fabric darts at the back to be sure everything lines up right in terms of the Velcro straps.Also, I don't know if my child is a mini Houdini or what, but it seems no matter how tightly I fasten down the Velcro, she manages to wriggle out her hands at the spaces where the flaps come together and depending on her level of energy, winds up tugging the fabric so that the whole of the swaddle shifts either north or south. Never so much that it threatens to creep over her face, but still, those gaps strike me as something of a slight design flaw. Also, it would be wildly helpful if there were a way to access the diaper area without having to completely undo the whole swaddle. But still, this is a solid product and am glad I made the purchase.",4
bumGenius One-Size Hook &amp; Loop Closure Cloth Diaper 4.0 - Blossom,"I like the color of this diaper.  It didn't leak, but the velcro fastener is not my favorite.  I prefer the snaps.  The diaper also seemed extra bulky.  My baby seemed uncomfortable in it too, not because of how it felt but because of its bulkiness.",3
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I would be a zombie if it weren't for this pillow, it's like my bff.I was a side sleeper pre pregs and without the pillow I found it impossible to get into a comfortable position with my growing belly.I've gone on vacation a couple of times since getting the pillow but because it is so large I had to leave it behind. Instead I found myself trying to recreate my own version of a snoogle with the hotel pillows and needless to say was unsuccessful.My fiance jokes around that he is going to order one for himself also and I will prob continue to use it after giving birth.",5

"Skip Hop Versa Diaper Bag, Cream Links","I purchased this bag to use as a &#34;travel&#34; bag.

Treasure Cove Pirate Accent Floor Rug by Sweet Jojo Designs,"Our bathroom is pirate themed. I love that this is not just the kiddie pirate crap that is everywhere. It's more realistic. The cotton rug looks great, and feels great on your tootsies after a warm shower. The 100% cotton rug is super absorbent and dries quickly. We love it!",5

"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Cuddle Cove Rocking Seat, Winslet",This pack n play rocks.  My grandson has happily slept in it since he was brought home from the hospital.  It is comfy and makes him feel secure--he particularly likes the slight vibration feature turned on--it is a great feature.  Only issue is with the changing table feature--which could use more support on one side as the baby rolls toward one side--a work around is a rolled up washcloth on one side.,4
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Audio Monitor, White","In spite of the other reviews I saw I still bought this baby monitor. And I have to say I'm very impressed with its range and sound quality. It was worth every penny, and it was a great price to begin with. Overall I'm a thoroughly satisfied consumer, and I would recommend this product to anyone looking to buy an affordable and quality baby monitor.",5
"SippiGrip - Universal Sippi Grip, That is compatible with all Type of Baby Bottle, Cup &amp; Baby Toys","For anyone who has played the ""pick up"" game with their baby/toddler, this is the perfect solution. The first couple times you pick up a cup off the kitchen floor after your baby/toddler has thrown it from their high chair it is cute and endearing. By the 100th time it is no longer cute, it is back breaking! The SippiGrip has been a blessing. It easily attached to our high chair at home and to our stroller while we are out. We haven't had a sippi cup hit the ground while taking a walk since we got this product. We bought two and I attach a cup to one and a toy to the other when we go out. No more lost chew toys! I would definitely recommend this to all my friends and family.",5
"Earthentree Organic Wooden Airplane Toy, Green","My 14 month old really likes this plane. He has other planes, but this one is the easiest for him to ""fly"" around in his little hands. I am really happy with the toy, and I love the quality of the paint (ours is a brilliant red). My only complaint is that the wings are not even... one side is lower than the other. Overall, good little toy for little boys that love airplanes!",4

Medela Medium-Flow Wide Base Nipples (3-Pack/ 4-12 months),"I ordered this item thinking that it would have the yellow neck needed to attched the nipple to the bottle as well.  The nipples work fine.  They're a nice size, not too big, but I would have liked to have the neck accessories as well.",4
Alva Baby Cloth Diaper 4 layers Antibacterial Bamboo Viscose Inserts Super Water Absorbent 12pcs 12mb,"I really like these, they wash up nice and seem to be just as absorbent as the micro-fiber, but I like that they are made of a more natural material. Would definitely order more.",5
Peg Perego Aria MT Lightweight Stroller,"It's not worth it for paying for $199 for this stroller.  So save money for soemthing else!1) It's very hard to stire (drive/move around) the stroller only after using 3 months.  Wheels keep going to one direction and you have to constantly apply the force to redirect the stroller.  It's very tireing.  Everyone who ended up pushing olur stroller ""noticed!"" about it.  Something that cost you almost $200 should not have such a problem.  Easy to move around is Must HAVE quality for the stroller.FYI, I didn't abuse the stroller, by taking to mountain or trail walk, this start happening after the normal usage of shopping and light neighbor walk.2) The cup holder on the handel keep pupping off!  Unbeliable cheapo quality!  I couldn't believe it!3) Harnest is keep crambling off from the back seat area, because there is only one hock to keep the harnest. The hock is short and doesn't lock, so everytime, you take harnest off from kid, it easily come off the hock.  It doesn't stay in the position.  It was so annying to set it back everytime before you put kids back on the seat...so now, i gave up and my kids just sit on them.  I wish they designed in a way the shoulder straps come out from the back of the seat pad and stable position.BUT IFyou don't care about money, and above low qualities, it's great one to have for the reason for a light weight and big and easy to use storage after all.",2

My daughter slept through the night at 6 weeks because I was able to swaddle her so well (my older children-not so much).The only thing they should put in the description is that these are the 42"""" x 42"""" size.  The 47"""" x 47"""" works much better when your child gets older.  We also bought the """"Princess Posie"""" set and they are the 47"""" square ones.",4

Clevamama Splash and Wrap Baby Bath Towel (Cream),"This solves an age-old dilemma -- how do you get a baby out of the bathtub while holding a towel, without either three arms or a prehensile chin? If you don't have the towel ready, you get soaked; if you do try to tuck it under your chin, chances are good you're either going to trail it into the bathtub or drop it altogether.The Clevamama towel has a bib-like closure on one side that goes around your neck, and a hood on the other side. You snap it on, lift Baby out of the tub and then put the little hood on his or her head, with no danger of dropping the towel or getting sopping wet.The material is thick and soft, and my daughter seems to really like her own little towel. However, I do wish the towel was a bit longer, for older babies. My daughter just turned 1, and it's quite a stretch to get the little hood on her anymore while one of us is wearing it. Also, it would be nice if one side had a color or pattern or something, so it's easier to see that you have it on right. We've frequently put it on backward, with the hood on the wrong side, which is a bit of a pain.",4
"Pampers Swaddlers - Size Newborn (up to 10 lbs.), 108 ct.","These are simply the best diapers you can buy.Thanks to some very generous people at three baby showers (Mom's work, Dad's work, friends/family), we had a ton of diapers.  We tried the following other diapers:-Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Diapers - Very good, my second favorite option, but the plastic texture is a bit coarse-GroVia Snap Diaper Shell System, Owlswith theGroVia Stay Dry Soaker Pads- Massive leaking/blowout problems-Nature Babycare Eco-Friendly Diapers, Size 1, 176-Count Package- Leaking problemsMost importantly, there are virtually zero blow-outs.  The built-in gussets stop everything.  Super absorbant.  Comfortable for the baby with absolutely zero chafing.  The adjustment tabs stretch considerably and make it easy to adjust for a skinny, chubby, or skinny-with-a-full-belly baby.  As far as I can tell, the diapers are either fragrance or perfume free.  And on top of all that, the blue line is a magnificent invention that helps to ascertain the difference between a wet or dirty diaper, or just after a really loud fart.Taking care of the Earth is nice and all, but when it comes down to it I'd rather have a happy baby who doesn't need to be changed every 30 minutes, and I'd definitely like to avoid baby feces on every other thing in the nursery.If I knew what I know now, I would have bought three boxes of this size at the very beginning and just felt good about the stockpile.  Instead, I tried multiple types, and bought less in bulk than I should have.  This box count (108) does not last as long as the parents of a newborn think it will.Absolutely the best diaper we have tried.",5
Safety First Dorel Safety Outlet Cover,"Bought these for plugs in our church nursery.

Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"I have been happy with this monitor so far. It does have some static, but as far as I can tell they all do. For some reason when it is unplugged and running on battery it's all static . . . I can't even have the sound on, and the noise bar is constantly on red (because of static). Also, several times I have seen another baby on the monitor, which is sort of creepy. Must be someone in our neighborhood. Personally, I don't use the video nearly as much as I did with my first son, and feel like it might have been a waste of money. But I loved it with my first child; it gives you a great sense of security.",4

Sassy Crib and Floor Mirror,"Soft exterior edges so it won't hurt baby.  Has a streatchy velcro fastener to attach to various objects.

Imse Vimse Flushable Liner - 200 count (Baby),when i told my husband we were going to use cloth diapers he was so concerned about the poop. so i looked into liners hoping to alleviate his worries. i read so many reviews i drove myself crazy. i ended up buying these because they costed less and you could wash them.they are horrible. they are so rough and scratchy. these liners gave my little one a horrible rash. they do get softer as your little one pees in them and sweats. you can actually wash them and reuse them.i just dont feel like these are worth giving my little a rash. thankfully my husband realized cloth is really no different then disposables and poop is not an issue.i would not buy them again and i have so many left that are going to waste.,1
"Sunshine Kids Radian XTSL Convertible Car Seat, Bentley",I ordered three of these car seats prior to my third child's birth. All three of my kids ride in radians! I wouldn't have it any other way!,5
Safety 1st High-Def Digital Video Monitor,"I purchased the Safety 1st High-Def Digital Video Monitor 08280 a few months ago for use with my newborn.  I already had the Graco Digital iMonitor and had been using it for 1 1/2 years with my son, and was desperate for something better.Due to the layout of my home, without a monitor, I cannot hear a crying child unless that child is in full-blown, screaming hysteria (especially if I am alseep myself).  For each of my kids, I wanted video and audio monitoring in order to give myself the greatest peace of mind possible.  I prefer digital technology to 900 MHz for safety reasons (don't want someone else looking into my kids' rooms or listening to the happenings inside my home).First, my complaints with the iMonitor.  The parental unit shuts itself off with no warning of any kind and at any given time.  At first I thought that perhaps the battery was dying, but as it turns out, the battery beeps loudly when it is running low, so that wasn't it.  I wondered if it had to do with having the monitor open or folded closed, but that wasn't it.  Graco's customer service was very unhelpful when I repeatedly called to ask for troubleshooting assistance.  They essentially denied that I was having this problem.  The monitor experiences frequent interference resulting in severe tiling of the image, so that you cannot see the child at all.  The monitor also tends to show the child for a few seconds or minutes, then the screen goes blue and a message comes up that reads, ""initializing video...""  No video or audio monitoring is available during the initialization process.  Since this process can take 10 seconds for every 1 second of actual imaging, the monitor can be completely useless for extended periods of time.  It also loses its connection to the nursery unit and must paired-up again.  This also happens for no apparent reason, and without warning.  Knowing that the iMonitor has these problems has caused me to sleep very lightly, even after my son started sleeping through the night.  I frequently jerk myself awake to check to see if the monitor is still on, and if so, to make sure that the monitor is working properly.  I paid $200 including shipping/tax for the iMonitor.Now the Safety 1st monitor.  I paid $192 including shipping/tax for this monitor in July, a few months after my daughter's arrival.  I love this unit and have only 2 minor complaints, so those complaints before the long list of pros.  The unit interferes with my wi-fi.  If I use my laptop within a few feet of the monitor, I lose my wireless connection.  I have found that my laptop must be at least 10 feet away from the monitor to keep my wireless connection.  This is somewhat annoying, but I can live with setting the monitor down 10 feet away from my computer workspace, confident that I can hear my child through the monitor at that distance, even if I can't see her.  Also, the light on the nursery unit is a large light in comparison to the light on the iMonitor.  The light flashes and is very bright.  Once my child is old enough to be annoyed by the light, I'll have to do something about it, but right now she is oblivious to the light.This monitor is amazing.  The monitor has a crystal-clear image, and has never tiled on me.  The monitor nevers shuts itself off (unless the batteries die), and has never yet lost its connection to the nursery unit.  The monitor can be set so that the image is always on (even when using battery power, which the iMonitor does not offer), or to remain on for a set number of seconds, up to 25 seconds.  When using this option, the monitor can be set to bring the image on if the child is making noise (parent sets the noise-level sensitivity).  If the child is not making any sounds, but you want to look in anyway, a push of the Video button on the front of the monitor immediately brings up the video of the child.  The Safety 1st is very sensitive to sounds, so I rate the audio component as superior also, even when using it on its lowest setting.  The monitor displays a color image when there is adequate light in the room, and then displays a night vision image when the room is dark.  Both types of imaging offer superior quality video.I have been using the Safety 1st monitor and the Graco iMonitor side-by-side for a few months and have noticed that when the two monitors are near each other, the Graco iMonitor absolutely cannot get past the ""initializing video"" stage, which means that it does not work at all.  Even in close proximity to the the iMonitor, the image on the Safety 1st monitor has never so much as flickered.  The Safety 1st is rock solid.I have just ordered a second Safety 1st to replace the Graco iMonitor in my son's room.  This time, the best price I could find was $230 including shipping/tax.",5
"NUK Trendline Silicone Spout Learner Cup, Blue/Orange Dots, 5-Ounce","Our 10 month old is still getting used to using a sippy cup and this one seems to work best so far. It only leaks a little bit. And, I notice he loves to teeth on the nipple.",5
"Bumkins Dr. Seuss Short Sleeve Toddler Tee, Blue Cat in Hat, 5T",I recieved this shirt in the mail. I purchased this product for my son's 1st birthday party. I am very pleased. Colors are vibrant and I recieved it in a timely manner. It was just as I expected.,5
BRICA Better Fit UV-Guardian Roller Shade,"I have two different types of shades already, the large ones that suction cup to the window and another than you just press like saran wrap.  Each has it's pluses and minus.  For this it's bulky and has limited coverage.  Unless you have a square window like the shape indicates, there's a lot of area not covered by the shade.  I used this in a '13 accord and it worked alright if the sun was in the right spot but I'd often have to adjust it my head as we traveled.  I wouldn't recommend this product.",3
BRICA Corner Bath Basket Toy Organizer,Holds quite a bit and stays put.  The color is vivid and it seems to drain well.  We have a smooth bathtub surround.,4
"Skip Hop Zoo Bib, Dog","We have several of these bibs, as they are great for traveling/going out to eat and fold into a small pouch to fit into a diaper bag, purse or pocket.  The bib is somewhat waterproof in that it will buy you a little time to blot liquids off of it before soaking into a child's shirt.  The little pocket at the bottom of the bib does a great job of catching food and keeping a child's lap clean. The velcro on this bib is strong enough to still work very well after a few washes.  The bib dries quickly and can actually be rinsed off in the sink with soap and water instead of being washed with the laundry (the velcro is strong enough to snag other pieces of laundry if it doesn't stay attached in the washing machine).  I highly recommend this product!  We received our first one as a gift and it has been by far, one of my most useful presents for our one year old!",5
Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor,"I had previously bought this same baby monitor for another daughter and she was able to add another camera to it when the next baby came along.

Kiinde Kozii,"Bought this about 3 months ago for our baby and so far no problems! It is on the pricier side but I like all the features and don't regret buying it.  It has a timer that you manually turn the dial for and it rings when done and shuts off.  The only negative is that once it starts, you can't add or reduce time really hence the 4 vs 5 stars",4
Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress,"After returning a coil spring mattress that sagged after almost no use, we decided on the Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress...The organic nature & construction of the crib mattress mattered to me and there is no sag issues at all.

We have a baby italia crib and it's a prefect fit - Also very light & easy to change sheets!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","My 4 month old son was already over the weight limit for pack and play bassinet inserts, so I wanted a pack and play without that added piece.  This product is great.  I took it on our first overnight trip to my mother's house, and our son fell asleep in it immediately.  While he isn't a good sleeper, by the third night he seemed to feel comfortable in it at night.  On another trip to visit family, we set him up in it and he slept well for his naps.  It sets up really easily, and I like the bright colors.",5
"Sassy Baby Food Nurser, Colors May Vary",I bought this product and within one hour the part that was supposed to hold the food in had turned sideways leaving a babyfood mess in the bag I was carrying it in.

"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Yellow","I recommend this product to all my new-mommy friends.  It's a must have!  My daughter still loves her SwaddleMe and she's 5mo.  I've used one since bringing her home from the hospital and she's always been a sound and LONG sleeper.  At 3mo she was sleeping through the night (8-10hrs)...honestly!  In her SwaddleMe she couldn't startle herself awake with her arms, and she loves feeling cozy and warm, like she's still in my belly.It's wonderful that they're offered in small and large, for babies that enjoy being swaddled beyond the first few months.They are worth every single penny... and they're so inexpensive.Good colour selection too.A perfect baby shower gift.  The new mommy will thank you endlessly for it.",5

Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,My son is only four months old and I didn't even start pumping until he was 2 months old to start storing some milk.  I usually pump about four times a week and I went to pump this morning and there was no suction!  Spend the extra money and buy a better pump.  I've heard a lot of good things about the whisper wear pump and ordered one of those today to replace this pump--medela doesn;t even make a car adapter for this pump,1
"Bright Starts Wish and Wave Toy, Pretty in Pink","I thought this rattle toy would be perfect for my 4 month old, but I was dissapointed when it arrived & didn't work. The on/off switch was in the on position & the batteries were already dead, and you can't change them out. The reason I'm still giving 3 stars is that it is still a very cute rattle & she enjoys playing with it anyways. I'm just dissapointed that it doesn't make the ""magical sounds"". Also Amazon is awesome because I requested a refund & they didn't even make me send the toy back, great customer service.",3
Britax Marathon in Ashley Floral,"I love this car seat, but more importantly, my 7-month old baby girl seems to love it too.  We switched her to this seat when she was 6 months old, and car rides have been a whole lot better.  She has plenty of room and it reclines better than her infant car seat (Graco snugride), and it is well padded.  We call it the princess' throne.  My husband was shocked at first at how much this thing costs, but now he understands why.  This was so easy to install and very safe.  I love the latch system--the thing barely moves.  You can't put a price on safety.  Plus this will grow with her until maybe she's about 5.  Also, you cannot go wrong with this beautiful fabric.  I love it--not another pink, but very girlie and sweet.  I LOVE IT!  WELL WORTH THE $$.",5

Diono Radian Angle Adjuster,"I was skeptical of how much this piece of foam would help create more space in our 2010 Elantra. It truly allows us to sit at our normal seat adjustments for both the driver's and passenger's locations. My husband and I are both tall - I'm 5'7"" and he is 6'2"", so we needed this extra few inches of space. Keep in mind that our 1-year-old son is rear-facing in the middle seat. I love our Radian even more now!",5
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Newborn Rock 'N Play Sleeper, My Little Sweetie","Perfect for newborns! Especially that have reflux.

Bright Starts Grab and Stack Blocks,These blocks were perfect for my 5mo baby boy. He can grab them so easily with his little hands.

We've had them for a couple months now and they have held up well to all his wear and tear. They still look brand new. LOVE THEM!,5

Still, it's one of the cheapest monitor sets out there and it does get the job done.My set transmits sound pretty reliably 95% of the time. Rarely, it will cut out inexplicably on the sound but still flash the lights, which I consider a backup feature.The receivers are touchy -- you can't put them too close to anything like a power cord or lamp, phone, of course. It is nice that the set includes 2 receivers which is handy.The night light is poor quality and I do not like using that feature. The temperature gauge is nice though!It's just really basic. Not a bad set, given the price. Just don't expect beautiful product design or high-quality audio.",3
Kiwi Pie One Size Fitted Diaper - Groovy,"I have tried a ton of different fitteds, pockets, AIOS, hybrids, flats, prefolds, and everything in between and these are my favorite diaper of all time. The prints are adorable, they are soft, made of bamboo (a highly sustainable resource) and in the USA, super absorbent, and just basically amazing.I have been using these since DD was about 3.5-4 months old and she is now 13 months. They have never failed me. I have super hard water which is so bad and we had to give up on thicker fitteds and anything with fleece. We can only use these, prefolds, flats, and g diapers with folded prefolds or flats instead of g diapers inserts. The only reason we can use these is because the inserts come out and they rinse clean faster.These have been a lifesaver on days when my toddler does not want to lay still long enough for me to wrap a flat around her and pin it on her with a Snappi and then put on a cover. She wants to go go go so these are perfect because I can just snap them on her while she's standing. I almost never use a cover with these because they are so absorbent and that way I know right when she's wet so I can change her.These are good for nights because they are so absorbent, we have used them for that when she was smaller but she is a heavy wetter so now we are a using a Bumgenius 4.0 with 2-3 folded flats instead of the fleecy inserts and those are better for us because they can hold a bit more wee than these.I LOVE the prints. Love them. The bight solids are so cute too. I have a little girl but I have even bought some of the more 'boyish' prints because they are so adorable. We have Chickadee, City Scape, Ooga Booga, Galaxy, Groovy, and Jungle. People on ebay are crazy about kiwi pie prints so they have a high resale value if you take good care of them, which another incentive to invest in these rather than less expensive fitteds.These are SUPER soft and my girl is comfortable in them. They don't impede her movement like some other, more bulky fitteds. I love the more durable snaps rather than the velcro, even if it does like a second or two longer to put them on. Also now that DD is eating big girl food and having big girl poos I appreciate the smoother fabric because it makes it easier to shake/scrape solids into the toilet.One thing to know about this diaper is NEVER to bleach it. We had a yeast attack a few months back and I used everything there is to try to kill it but nothing would, and we had to resort to bleach. Unfortunately it ruined one of the Kiwi Pies and now its a diaper for DD's baby doll. It got holes all over it. If you get yeast on a Kiwi Pie the best thing to do is try everything but bleach to kill it, and if that still doesn't work try to use smallest possible amount of bleach instead of doing what I did in a moment of desperation and dumping a huge amount in the wash and then rinsing for 2 days to make it all come out. (I was sleep deprived. Give me a break.)I completely agree with the other poster who said they would replace their entire stash with Kiwi Pie if they could. I would too. I wish I had found these before trying any other diaper and wasting all that money. I just wish they made these in a larger size because my toddler will be grown out of hers soon!",5

"Edushape Textured Brightly Colored Foam Building Blocks, Set of 80","I had expected better. The shapes themselves are fine but they are light weight and feel &#34;cheesey&#34; There are a lot of small, read edible pieces.

"Summer Infant Sure and Secure Deluxe Bedrail, Pink n' Plush","We bought this for our 3.5 year old because we just transitioned her to a twin bed.  The bed does not have a box spring, the mattress sits in the bed frame (south shore storage bed).  The bedrail is sturdy and secure.",5
4moms MamaRoo 005001401 Rocker Bouncer Plush in Multi Color with Rattle Teether Toy,"The construction is solid, the movement is great and the built in white noise sounds really relax my son.  He's loved it from 2 weeks old.We were really excited about the possibility of using our iPod with the swing - but the speakers are poor quality.  My son doesn't care, but it drives me and my husband crazy.My biggest concern is the lack of head support.  From 2 to 10 weeks - I had to use blankets to support his head and neck.  Without the extra support his head would fall forward or be crooked to the side in a way that looked dangerous.  I recently saw the infant insert for sale.  For a product advertised as an infant swing, I was very disappointed that I'd have to buy a head support separately.  This cost quite bit, and even the cheapest regular swing includes a head pillow!Overall, my son likes it, but I think it should be improved to justify the cost.",3
"Leachco Easy Teether XL Convertible Crib Rail Cover, Ivory","My son has one of those sleigh bed cribs and the rail is very wide...This cover fit over it perfectly..in fact,my son's crib looks just like the crib that is displayed in the photo.

Replacement Tubing (Retail Pack of 2) for Medela Pump in Style and New Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump - 100% BPA FREE,I needed a new set of tubing for my Medela Pump in Style beastpump. The place I got them from 2 years ago had trippled their price so I tried Amazon and they were very affordable and the exact same as the Medela tubing. Good price and fast delivery. I would definately recommend.,5
"Maxi Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat, Sweet Cerise","My daughter is taller than many her age at 17mths.  Her legs still don't hit the back of the seat as some other car seats cause them to have to sit cross-legged.  She is still rear facing.  We travel a lot - long trips, and shorter 1-3 hour weekend trips.  She appears to be comfortable, head doesn't droop forward, and she sleeps well.  It also doesn't get too hot - we are in the deep south and I was concerned about that.  The material wipes down easily, and she loves the built in cup holder.  I just purchased this 2nd seat for a grand child. Installation isn't too bad - even compared with other seats like the Britax.  The cushion in this seat just can't be beat- the only other seat I would even consider would be the Chicco NextFit.  It just wasn't out when I got my first seat about a year ago!",5

Levana Safe N'See Digital Video Baby Monitor with Talk-to-Baby Intercom and Lullaby Control (LV-TW501),"DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY - THEY DO NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTIES.I purchased this monitor for my sister as a baby shower gift in March.  In September, it stopped working becuase of a defect.  It was still under the 12-month warranty, so we sent it back to the manufacturer, they charged my card $200 for a replacement until they received the original unit back.  Took two months for them to refund the cost of the replacement.  Its not 6 months later and the replacement unit is now no longer working.  We called the manufacturer AGAIN because its only been 6 months and we now needed ANOTHER replacement.  They claim because the original unit was purchased more than 12 months ago that the warranty is no longer in effect.  I argued that the new unit was only 6 months old, they said they go by the original purchase date.  Which makes no sense.  I am now out my original $200 and we have no working monitor.  I will NEVER purchase a Levana product again and will warn everyone to do the same.",1
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"Wife loves this calender. Comes with a lot of stickers and options to mark the firsts. Includes spaces for milestone photos as well. Sticker borders for photos, etc, it is just a very easy to use scrap booking option. Especially for new moms who dont have enough time to actually sit down, and haul out a ton of scrapbook supplies",5
"Oh Katy One Size Pocket Diaper, Berry","I'm so bummed that these diapers failed me. I really wanted to like them and thought they were the winner when I put them on and they seemed to fit my 8 month old perfectly. I've tried BumGenius, EcoBumz, Best Bottoms, and Thirsties and although not all of them are a ""great"" fit none of them have ever leaked. I put the Oh Katy on and not 2 hours later his onesie was soaked. I thought I had done something wrong so tried again with the other one I had bought. Nope-2 hours later again the outer cover was soaked. My other cloth diapers have never leaked...even overnight! They are soft and seem comfy, but don't seem to be absorbent at all. I'll be purchasing more BumGenius and Best Bottoms which are my favorites so far.",2
Lamaze Yellow Duck Duckie Baby Interlock Receiving Blanket Cotton,"I received this blanket and the pink one that is no longer available for my daughter. They are AMAZING, so soft and thick! Not like the cheaper ones from other brands. This is a blanket my daughter will have for years! The colors and patterns are bright and gorgeous! I wish I couldn't bought the pink one for a friend before it sold out. Don't hesitate to buy this blanket its worth every penny!!",5
"Graco Shelby Classic 4 in 1 Convertible Crib, Cappuccino",Well I agree with the other comments about the random holes in the wood. It does look as if they are trying to make it look old western like. The holes make the crib slightly ugly but I can live with it as my babies will eventually destroy it anyways. It did come slightly damaged and I have not decided to contact Graco yet to see if I can get a replace side. I may just live with it. Overall it's not a bad crib for the price.  It is very easy to assemble. Small women may want to get a second helper to put it together though as it can be difficult for one small person to try to bolt the sides together. The crib appears pretty strong. I'm pretty satisfied.  No complaints at all towards Amazon.,4
Prince Lionheart Dresser Top Diaper Depot,"I just thought that this was a temporary solution for us, because i wanted the diaper stacker... This ended up working so much better! I can have diapers in it, plus powder lotion and a brush or other things in the sides!

"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","My husband is one of those tech guys and came home with it...I was ticked off he spent $250 bucks on this thing.  I thought what an over priced thing.  However I have since changed my tune its a very nice monitor and I'm sure we will use it for years and years.  The color and night vision are great.  Controls are easy to use.  I love that it plays music, has a temp gage, and a 2 way speaker.  The baby can be in his room and I know he is safe, warm, and sleeping away. The only slightly annoying things are...the screen is bright in our bedroom at night and the price.  I guess you get what you pay for ...right?",5
"Evenflo Portable BabySuite 300, Marianna","Bought this to use as a daytime nap bed for my newborn so that i can keep it in my living room. The legs underneath didn't withstand the fabric they are attached to as they have already tore off. I'm constantly crawling under the play yard to straighten out the legs when i move it. The two rods used to hold up the sleeping pad when using the raised level have already detached making the level feature impossible for me to use so the pad is currently on the bottom of the play yard due to safety reasons. The sleeping pad itself isn't constructed very well. It creases and is constantly having to be readjusted. It is very handy with the changer feature and the side pouch, where i can keep diapers and wipes handy. Somewhat difficult to put together when it arrived but overall it is aesthetically pleasing and okay for the purpose that i use it for.",3

"KoalaKin, Hands Free Nursing Pouch, Black/Green (Small Vest, XS/S Pouch)",This thing is awesome! Takes the strain off my back. Helps keep the baby in the correct position even when you move around. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I am unaware of the durability since I have not had it long--seems to be made of high quality materials though. Worth the money!!!,4

GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack,"Our baby has used these since birth...he is 15 mos old and still in love with his paci.  They are soft and flexible in his mouth easy to attach to most paci holders, and are nearly the same shape and texture as a standard narrow neck latex bottle nipple making the use of an occasional bottle easy for this mostly bf baby.  There is a hard plastic peice inside the paci used to keep its curved shape that I wish wasn't there because if you accidentally smash the paci under foot or some other way it will break and poke through the silicone making it unusable.  Otherwise it would be very durable.  Baby now has eight teeth and hasn't bit through a paci yet.",4
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",This is a great stroller! I have a peg perego car seat a this stroller works great with it. My 5yr old loves to ride on the back and the handle bars are very comfy. I use this daily for running around and shopping.The reason I didn't give this a 5 Star is because the lack of cup holder. In this day and age all strollers should have them. I went to a local baby store and picked on up for $13.,4

DaVinci Full/Twin Size Conversion Rail Kit - Natural,"It seemed people were commenting about needing slats or issues with the rails once the crib was converted to a bed.  I converted into a full size bed.  But, so the height wouldn't be too much for my 2yro son, I explored options to just use a mattress.  The mattress company have this special board that fits perfectly and does NOT require any additional support.  It's like a box spring, but only a flat version.  It was about $70...it is a fantastic choice to keep the mattress on well and in place.  So, I have had NO issues with the rails.  Now, the instructions and getting the crib changed were a different story.  The crib instructions were a little better than what came with the rails.  And, these do seem a little higher priced than they seem they should.  I'm happy though.",4
"Fisher-Price Take Along Cam Video Monitor, Grey/White","Works great for the price. Short range, but works! Would recommend if on a tight budget. Like the shape and weight.",4
Badger Basket Company Tranquility Baby Bassinet Cherry Frame with Ecru Dots Bedding,"I bought this bassinet because I liked the way it looked... it was different from other bassinets and I found it for a reasonable price on Amazon.  The only problem is that part of it was unusually difficult to assemble.  The four wooden rods which make the basket are attached together with screws-  Unfortunately, the size of the holes do not seem to match up with the size of screws.  One of the four rods ended up cracking during assembly.  The good thing is that you can go online to a website provided on the instruction sheet and order any replacement part for free within 30 days of purchasing the product.  So we received the replacement part and tried again, this time using an electric screwdriver.  It was still not the easiest task, but at least this time nothing cracked.If you are going to buy this product, I would recommend trying to assemble it soon after you receive it so that if there is a need to replace a part, you can do so for free.I can't comment about comfort as my baby hasn't arrived yet....",4
Munchkin Dora Pacifier 6 Months - Up,This is the only Binky my daughter will take. So far they are no longer found in stores in my area.

I will definitely order more from here if I have to!!!,5
"Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green","This drying rack arrived in the mail today, and I am already so happy with it! I have been drying my babys bottles etc. on a paper towel next to the sink, so this is a welcomed replacement! It looks really trendy and neat and holds more items than I expected. I like the fact that it is very portable, i.e. I can move it very easily to clean the countertop, and it is dishwasher-safe. I would highly recommend this product.",5
"Nuk Trendline 2 Count Dots Cup, Blue/Green, 5 Ounce",My son has been exclusively breastfed since birth and has always refused every bottle we've ever given him. Now that he is 6 months old our ped recommended that we start getting him to try drinking small amounts of water from a sippy cup. After going through a few other brands I was beginning to lose hope that he'd ever drink from anything but my breast... that is until we bought this sippy cup! He took to it INSTANTLY! I am sooooo pleased with this product!!!,5
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","A good sturdy car seat, not as hard to install as other reviews make it seem.  My daughter really likes it.  The fabric of the straps could be thicker to keep them from rolling, otherwise no complaints.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube Kids Musical Toy,"My 1 year old grandchild enjoys her cube very much. It was a Christmas gift sent directly to her parent's home so I don't have first hand knowledge of the weight as some others commented. I have seen her play with it in videos and it's a hit. She delights in playing the different sides and when it stops, she makes sure it continues. Big smiles. It's 4 days after Christmas.",5
"Summer Infant Swaddleme Sacks, Cheeky Cheetah, Medium","I love that the Summer wearable blanket has a two way zipper. My little one always struggles with me everytime we get her dressed for bed and it can be impossible to try and line up the two sides of the very small zippers on the other brands of wearable blankets. The two way zipper makes it so easy to zip it right up even with her wriggling all over the place. The fabric felt a little rough and scratchy when I first took it out of the package, but after the first wash it felt nice and soft and has gotten softer with each washing.",5
"Nurtria BPA Free Flip Top Straw Cup, Girl, 9 Ounce","I purchased this cup for my 1yr old. The cup is nice and a good size for little fingers. It closes tight which is nice when traveling with it.  However, I feel the liquid comes out too fast for a 1yr old.  Also, the cup leaks from the straw when tipped or falls. We won't be buying another.  On the hunt for a new cup.",3
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,"These are great. They don't leak and are nice and sturdy. The tops come off and nipple tops can be directly attached. After he stopped with these bottles, I used them since they had flat closed tops, to shake up his formula. I love Avent products and these are wonderful.They attach to the bottom of the Avent VIA Isis pump directly which was nice. Great for storage of baby food later on as well. Tops can be used with 9ounce bottles as well.",5
Fisher-Price Cheer for Me Potty,"bought this for my daughter to try to encourage potty training.  Thought the music playing would encourage her to try it.  when it came we put it together.  The first time she sat on it, the back part of toilet fell off and continued to do so.  it doesn't put together securely.  Another thing that is wrong with it, is the music only played about 5 times all together and completely stopped after that. Not a good product at all! wouldn't even give it 1 star",1

Happy that it's organic, but care instructions suggest not to wash.  So far that hasn't been an issue, but at some point I'm sure being in a toddler bed, it will need to be washed.  Just the right size for young kids!",4
Philips Avent Digital Two-Parent Baby Monitor with Zero-Interference DECT Technology,"We loved this monitor when it worked, but didn't realize you had to put rechargeable batteries in it.  My husband replaced them the other night, and it ruined the monitor.  The batteries were partially melted and acid was coming out of them.  When he took them out, he saw the note that said only rechargeable batteries.  This is our fault - we should have read more carefully, but wanted to help others learn from our mistakes.On a positive note - we loved the fact that it let us know what the temperature was in our daughters room.",3

Dr. Brown's Deluxe Wide Neck Bottle Starter Kit - 3 pack,"Our one-month old daughter has had quite a talent for spitting-up about a 4-oz. bottle's worth of formula two to three times a day.  We had been using Avent, which seemed to work just fine for our first daughter, but not for no. 2.  Thus, after reading lots of reviews (and realizing that every bottle has some great reviews and some terrible reviews!) -- and on our pediatrician's recommendation -- we tried Dr. Brown's.  Over the course of the last three days, our daughter has spit-up only once.  I will admit that the guy standing next to me at the local store said that his kid spit-up a lot more with Dr. Brown's but that they have had great luck with Playtex...so I suppose it really does depend on your kid.  My advice is to buy one bottle from a few different systems and start trying them until you find one that works well after several consecutive feedings.Complaint rebuttals:COST - without the right bottle, you'll spend as much on laundry detergent (for baby's bibs and clothes...as well as your own!) as you would on ""better"" bottles, so you may as well go ahead and get the right bottles now...and given all of the ""patented"" no-gas bottle systems out there now, Dr. Brown's really isn't that much more than the other ones.DIFFICULTY IN CLEANING - deal with it.  First of all, if you give a bottle a good rinse immediately after using it (rather than letting it sit around to collect a crust....anyone with a toddler has probably discovered an old bottle or sippy cup under the couch), then cleaning is not a problem.  I'll spend an extra 30 seconds on a cleaning if it means my kid is not going to yack on me.LEAKING - No bottle is guaranteed not to leak.  We've had Avents that leaked, and Avents that didn't.  We've had Evenflo sippy cups that leaked, and Evenflo sippy cups that didn't.  So far, no leaking on Dr. Brown's for us, but I fully expect that eventually one of them will leak for one reason or another.  It happens.",5

Hard to find so glad I found a place I can order it online and skip the trips to the co-op only to find they only have little bottles or are out!,4
"Prince Lionheart bebePOD Flex Plus Baby Seat, Green/Kiwi","I ordered this seat while Bumbo seats were recalled but my 5-month-old has used it very few times. The tray is hard to attach and it's hard to get it off. I have to actually hold my baby almost upside down in the seat to slide him out and then struggle with the tray later. While he loves the toy on the tray, it's hardly worth the effort of attaching it and then fighting to detach it. Also, the seat doesn't seem to be terribly comfortable; I'm not sure it gives him enough support. I really wish the Bumbo hadn't been recalled just days before I stopped at Burlington Coat Factory to pick one up because I think that seat would have been more useful for us. Now that they're back on the market, I'd try one of those or another of the available options. I'm glad this seat doesn't tip over like Bumbo seats do but it hardly matters since we don't use it anyway!",3
Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen,"This is your best choice if you want to see your child sleeping very clearly at night. You can even see facial expressions and details in the dark. We spent a lot of time trying to find out how to add an additional camera to this unit. The easiest way is to call Summer Infant customer service and order over the phone ($119.99 includes tax and shipping and a 1 year warranty). The number is 1-800-268-6237. As noted in other reviews, this monitor will interfere with wireless internet...so it is difficult to surf the web while the monitor is on. But overall this is by far the best video quality.",5
Red Polka Dot Satin Diaper Cover juDanzy Bloomer 0-6 Months,"I order this diaper cover for my photographic studio and ordered size 0-6 months, as been label on the bag but the bloomer's label (sized) as a x-small.

La bolsa en que lo recib&iacute; estaba etiquetada como tal pero la etiqueta del bloomer dice xsmall, parece que es para un bebe prematuro, quiz&aacute;s le quede a un recien nacido dependiendo del tipo de pa&ntilde;al que utilice y de ninguna manera le quedara a un bebe de 6 meses.L&aacute;stima, que la calidad es buena y el color es como la imagen que se muestra, aunque nada extraordinario",2
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",We bought the mulit colored gate for better wear and tear.  This set makes a large circle or you can use outer walls as the other side of the perimeter.  It seems heavy enough to slow down our toddler for a minute.  We'll see how long it takes for him to figure out how to scale the walls!  Good product and fulfills intended purpose.,4

Our son is almost 4 and I have had one for him for almost 4 years.

The projection is fun and bright, the sounds are soothing, the remote is a fantastic option and now that he keeps it by his bedside table to turn back on.  I can't take it off of him for baby on the way! He loves it too much.",5

Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"We first saw this fold-up infant tub in the NICU unit where our baby stayed for her first 4 weeks.  Its ability to be easily stored was a big plus in the hospital, as well as at home.  The NICU nurse recommended that we line any infant tub with one of those baby bath sponges (ours is yellow and in the shape of a bear).  We use our tub in the kitchen sink.  Leaks, pinches and mildew have never been a problem.  Oddly enough, we have found that our baby likes to sit in the tub backwards (once she could hold up her head).  This positon is more upright and also makes it easier to wash her hair.  We use the kitchen sprayer on low and place a washcloth over our baby's torso which we frequently re-wet with warm water to keep her from getting cold.  Our baby is still a bit small for 4 months, but we anticipate that this tub will work for several more months.  Our baby loves bath time!- Our baby is now 8 months old and about 16 pounds.  We have used this infant tub up until this point and are just now graduating to the big tub.  This fold-up tub was a great purchase for us!",5
Baby on a Board - Boy (Surfboard - Boy),"I was so glad to finally find a ""baby on board"" decal that wasn't the old skool typical ones that had no character or color at all. I LOVVVVEEE personalized items, and to be able to pick the tan, color and background for my own babies, not to mention great baby shower gifts, made me the ultra super gift-giver! And the babies are sooo cute... round and chubby like all babies should be!! Buy one for all the babies you know and throw that yellow one out the car window!",5

Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,"We bought two of these, both from amazon prime, about a month apart.  The first one matched the picture above and the second had a light blue lid, handle, etc rather than the darker blue.  The darker blue one doesn't leak for the most part, as long as your careful and don't overfill.  The light blue one leaks like a mother at the lid when you start pumping / mixing.  It's not a tight enough fit.",3
"Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat, Gray","This mat looks nice, is sturdy and very thick so my seats will definitely be protected.  It is really big which is perfect because I have a Britax Boulevard and I was a little worried that the mat might be smaller than the carseat.  It wraps around the headrest and tightens easily which works out great because our son is still rearfacing but is getting pretty big and likes to kick around so this mat will save us some headaches.  My husband's car doesn't have a headrest in the center but he does have the carseat latch that the mat can be attached to for his acura TL.  If I ever need to buy another car seat mat, I will definitely be buying this one again.",5

So far, these are my favorite child-proof locks.",5

"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","I got this set for my daughter when she started preschool last year and it is adorable. The only thing is that the backpack is a bit too small. Her teacher had asked for a backpack big enough to hold a folder, and this was not it. I stuck it out though, since I had spent the money on it, and made it through the year, but bought her a new one for the following year. We are keeping this one for overnights. She can out a couple of light items in there and carry it herself. Aesthetically speaking, specially for someone who loves owls, this is adorable!",4

Fisher-Price Coco Sorbet Soothing Motions Glider,"I love this thing. My son slept in it every night for 2 months. Sometimes with it on sometimes not. Got tired of sleeping in it all night so I brought it downstairs. He's 5 months old and he still loves it. He now can reach the toys and will just  sit in there and look around. He still takes naps in it. He doesn't mind if its on or off. And the batteries last forever we've never had to change them. And as often as its used my husband and I are surprised about that. Made very well, easy to use and move. Very sturdy as well. No complaints here. I would defiantly recommend this. Probably one of the best baby product we've bought when it comes to bouncers, swings, ect.",5

Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 2 Standard Nipple,"I find Dr.Brown's bottles to be the best, even though they are harder to clean.  I also find their nipple flow rates are best and match what my baby needs at the stated age most closely.  With these, she drinks fairly quickly but we don't get tons of milk dripping down her chin.  My only complaint is the two pack.  The bottles come in packs of three, right?  Shouldn't the nipples be available in the same quantity.  Seems like a hot dog , hot dog bun conundrum and that is the reason for my removal of a star..",4

"P'Kolino Little Sofa Lounge, Red","I have an inhome daycare and have been looking for a better flip sofa then they offer at the toy stores. This is what I've been looking for.  I didn't have a lot of  space for it so I needed a small but sturdy sofa.  Two children can sit or lay on it just fine.  It is definetly designed for one to four year olds, and not practical to be used as a sleeping area.  The kids love it.",5
Gerber Graduates Kiddy Cutlery 3 Piece Spoon Set,"I bought this set as a Christmas gift for my niece. I used this kind for my own kids and they are still in fantastic shape after 4 years of constant use. The handle is a very good size for toddler hands, is easy to control, and is a good length too. It is somewhat soft, soft enough to bite and make a mark. The 'bowl' of the spoon holds a good amount of food for a toddler's mouth.I would highly recommend this type of silverware for toddlers.",5
4 layer Bamboo Terry Inserts for Cloth Diapers (Pack of 12),"I purchased the 4 layer bamboo terry inserts when I replaced all of the microfiber inserts in my pocket diapers.  I wanted to use natural fabrics and was also having compression leaks with the microfiber.  I pair these with a hemp insert and they work very well.  The inserts are trim, highly absorbing, easy to stuff, and do not retain any ammonia odor.  I have been using them for four months and they are holding up to frequent washing/drying.  I have had a few stains but a little time in the sun has done the trick each time.  I highly recommend the 4 layer bamboo terry inserts.",5
Britax Seat Saver Waterproof Liner,"So much better than other brands that I have tried. My daughter had an accident and unfortunately it didn't hold all the liquid inside, but neither has the other ones I've tried. This one stays put well and is bigger size than other brands, so far it's my favorite.",4
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink","I had really high hopes for the Aqueduck to help give my toddler a bit of independence whilst washing her hands.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite meet those high expectations.  My kiddo is in the 60% height for her age and even with a step stool, the Aqueduck doesn't extend the water quite far enough for her to reach at the bathroom sink.  Also, within a week it was growing mildew on the back part that touches the faucet.  I really expected such a product to be anti-microbial or something to not be instantly gross.  I'm constantly having to soak the thing in vinegar to get rid of the yucky black mold.  This may be caused by the fact that water lays in the little spout - it doesn't fully drain when you turn off the water.  You have to tip the remaining water out of it after shutting the faucet off, which wears on the opening that attaches it to the faucet.  It's a great idea, it just didn't live up to my expectations.",3
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","These pads are incredibly soft and comfortable, unfortunately, I have one side that leaks rather heavily and woke up absolutely soaked! I leaked right through. I realize this isn't the pad's fault since the other side was just perfect, but I thought I should say that if you are a 'leaker', you might want to consider something more water-proof. Otherwise, these are a great investment!",3
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Mobile with Remote Control,"I'm glad I registered for this mobile and so is my baby.  He's four months old and after the 2nd month, he really enjoyed the light projection on the ceiling.  He's not so much into the dangling fish of the mobile component (named after the 3 Stooges) although he does coo at them once in a while.  (He does love the Ocean Wonders Aquarium crib toy though!)  I play the mobile for him as part of his bedtime routine and he's usually asleep by the time the mobile lights and music are done.  When he's fussy around bedtime, just starting this mobile and letting him see the ceiling or walls where the fish/stars/commas(?) are circling can distract him from whatever is distressing him.  The mobile mechanism is not excessively noisy, just a slight hum with the music and in the four months we had this, it's worked well.  I like that I can change the music at the touch of one of the buttons or turn the music off or on one of the two music volumes.  I also like that when I use the mobile when my son is lying in the cradle, I can turn off the light projection or the light facing him, or both.  I'd give this five stars but it doesn't fit onto my crib.  The only reason we can use this now is that it does fit on the cradle in my room, but once my son goes into his crib, it's no longer useful except as the light projector in the dresser-top mode.  It's too bad, I really wanted it to fit on my crib.",4

"Evenflo Triumph 65 DLX Seat, Lincoln",How do you rate the car seat that saved your son's life?We were in a horrific roll over collision when my son was 11 months old.  When I crawled through the upside-down SUV to the backseat my son was hanging upside down in his carseat completely unharmed and laughing.  The Evenflo carseat did everything it was supposed to do & it held him in all the right ways. I bought a brand new one the day after the accident.Now that I have baby #2 on the way I am buying another one.  I reccomend this car seat to everyone I know.,5

"Prince Lionheart Whirl Balance Scooter, Natural/Pink","This bike is now my daughters favorite thing to do as soon as she gets outside.  It did take a little while to move from the tricycle to this.  So it may take a few days but if you persist it will quickly become a favorite and now she just glides along.  It is a little heaver than a simple frame balance bike but not to much and I've had to carry it up hills a few times.  But the quality is superb, the tires are solid and the wood frame seems very durable.  I do keep it inside though so I'm not sure how it would hold up to weather, but surviving a 3 year old is a solid test in my book!",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Straw Bottle, Ladybug, 12 Ounce",My 4 year old daughter loves it. I purchased this with the matching lunch bag and book bag. Love it!,5
"Baby Jogger Bassinet, Black","The only complaints I have with this bassinet is the way it attaches to the Baby Jogger F.I.T and how the canopy operates. The mechanism that locks this into the stroller has a very flimsy feel to it. As a result, the bassinet sometimes gets stuck and it is often impossible to safely detach it from the stroller with the baby in the bassinet.To lower the canopy, you need three hands. You have to simultaneously press buttons on both sides and operate the canopy support bar with your third hand. The covers are surprisingly versatile, though. Our baby loved to ride in this on her tummy looking forward. The canopy can be opened from the back to enable this. The pockets in the lining of the bassinet are very convenient for storing all the little things you need with babies.",4

"Angelcare Baby Sound Monitor, White",I just received this in the mail today and I love it! We live on the 7th floor of an apartment complex and there is a lot of concrete in the building. We have tried 2 other baby monitors before this one and we had nothing but white noise and static and our apartment is not that large. This one however is crystal clear! I haven't had it long enough to know it the temp is correct but all I care is I can hear my baby perfectly with NO STATIC!!!,5

The blanket I received had the horse and carriage on it in the corner (part of the matching crib set design).  Cute, but not what I wanted to give my daughter.",3
SafeFit Car Seat Travel Tote,"Tight fit with our Britax Marathon, but great for luggage checking the car seat, easy to wheel or wear as back pack. I had no idea that it was FREE to check a car seat, even on flights that charge for luggage. This made it easier than renting one or dragging it through the airport.",4
BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector,Working very well. Sturdy construction.,5
Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Wide Neck Newborn Feeding Set,"I love these bottles. My LO is breastfed, but needs bottles for when I am working. These bottles haven't leaked and are relatively easy to clean. It's a little pain to clean because you have to use the little brush, but it is well worth it to know my son has less gas.  Would definitely buy more as well as recommend them to by friends.",5
Especially for Baby Stroller Umbrella,"it is not fancy but we used it on the stroller and a baby backpack and loved it.  eventually it broke or we lost it and now we are about to buy another one for child # 2.  it's only 10 bucks, what do you expect?!  it was VERY handy.",4
"Boon Flair Pedestal High Chair with Pneumatic Lift, Pink/White","I actually purchased this highchair from a different place where I got a better deal, but I did a lot of research on Amazon.com from other reviewers.  I was hesitant on buying this because I couldn't find a local store that sold it so I could see it in person... but I went ahead and took the plunge.  I'm so glad I did!  I got it in pink and it's so cute.  Much nicer on the eyes than other highchairs.  It's so easy to keep clean.  As far as cleaning, if you feed your baby something that easily stains (something red or orange) and don't clean it right away off of the white part, it will stain.  I had read other reviews from people that stated the food tray is too small.  It is smaller than other brands, but what I want to know is how much are they planning on feeding their baby?  For small children, it's the perfect size.  It's probably equivalent to a 9"" or 10"" dinner plate.  When I bought the chair I didn't think that I would have a need for the wheels.  But I found that it actually helps my chair serve a dual purpose.  I'll just wheel it into our living room for my daughter to sit in vs. the floor while watching one of her shows (our TV is mounted above the fireplace).  The height adjustment is nice too because I can sit down and feed her or do it standing up if I'm doing other things in the kitchen.  The chair feels very stable and so far I am completely pleased with it.  I would definitely purchase again.",5
All-In One Baby Hobo Backpack &amp; Nursing Pillow (Blue Stripe),"When I saw this, I fell in love with it online. When I received it in the mail, I loved it even more. There are so many pockets and so much room to store things, and it was so cute. So many cute features on the bag, makes it pretty cool. I loved everything about the bag, until I started using it. For it being so pricey, the quality is pretty low. It started ripping in one spot, like 3 weeks after using it. After the first rip, everything else went downhill. It's falling apart at the seems almost everywhere! I'm so glad that I didn't pay full price for this, cause I would have been more upset. I had bought it off Zulily, and got it for like $50.",2
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","Very secure when we attched the gate to the wall with the nails. It was for the top of the stairs so I didn't feel like just wall pressure would be safe enough. My only complaint is that the door itself is not very big. It is very hard trying to leave in the morning carrying a carseat, a diaper bag and my purse and lifting everything over the gate because it won't fit through it. Plus, it doesn't allow you to switch which side the door will swing open to. Ours has to open towards the wall which makes things even harder.",4
"Real Nappies 6-Pack of Snug Wrap Diaper Covers, Toddler Size, for babies 18+ months, 29 lb to 40 lb","I bought both NB and 3-6 months and I absolutely love them. They were the best bang for my buck. I found a Bummis Super Whisper Wrap at the thrift store and it is exactly the same (minus cute prints)  I have used them with flannel fitted diapers that I made and with Indian prefolds.  Using with prefolds can be a bit bulky, but these are very functional and I the only leaks where from me not putting the diaper tight enough. I make my own waterproof diapers but I absolutely love these and use them often. I recommend them for anyone on a tight budget.",5
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,"I wish I'd gotten this when we first started doing bottles.  It does best if you do 28 ounces or less, but even if you have to make two batches, it's so much easier than making the bottles seperately.  It also does a much better job of mixing the formula, it seems to give it a completely different texture (in a good way).  I've read some reviews that it's flimsy.  Thruthfully, I've washed it as directed in the top of the dishwasher and had no issues.  Even if it did, I'd just shell out another 10..it's a small price for the ease it provides.",5
Tiny Love Symphony-in-Motion Remote Mobile,"We've had this mobile since my son was born, and although it took him a month or so to really take to it, now it's become indispensable! He's actually nearing the age where he can reach for the animals, and i'm dreading the inevitable day when we have to take it down. =-(A couple of comments though - we originally had the version with the remote, but we found that the remote was only useful if you stand directly in front of the crib/music box. If you try to use it in a diagonal line (such as from the door to my son's room), it's useless. So we took it back.The music on the mobile without the remote is oddly not as loud as the music on the mobile with it. (Same songs though, and the volume is still fine.)The first mobile we brought home from Babies R Us was in a box that had been opened already. (Typical.) We got it home and the songs played, but the mobile didn't turn. I went back and exchanged it for an unopened box, that worked perfectly. After a few months, the sound was dying so we replaced the batteries. After that, the sound was fine, but the mobile no longer turned! I'm on my third mobile now, and i'll keep exchanging them if i have to. It's a great product, but keep the box and receipt!",5
Ameda Eco Flange Standard 25mm Non Retail Packaging #620549 - 2 Each,"I ordered these as a second pair when I was pumping at work. For sure these are different than the thicker ones that came with my electric pump, but for me they allowed for the same quantity of pumped milk and the same degree of comfort. The design of these is much simpler, so I can clean these with just a cloth, whereas I felt I needed to use the nipple cleaning brush to get at the little spaces in my original pair. When you're working full time and slogging through a sink full of bottle and pump parts at night, that little bit of saved time makes you feel good lol. Plus it meant I could wash these at work without having to bring the nipple brush with me.The only weird thing about these is the neck is short and the diaphragm gets a little scrunched up, which is a puzzling bit of design, but it doesn't seem to affect the performance. Just makes me wonder if it would wear out the diaphragm a little faster (I used them daily for about 12 weeks and they were still working fine).Also, as is mentioned in the product description, these will not work with the manual pump (they don't have the ring of plastic around the neck that the manual one connects to), so keep that in mind if you use the manual pump too.",5
Combi Connection Infant Car Seat Night Rider,"My child seat comfortably and sleeps pretty well. So, I assume it is a comfortable seat for children. It has lots of cushions. The cat seat sits very easily on the base. Lightweight.It's very difficult to use seat belt with the base. The path of seat belt is very complicated (it has to go underneath the base). Probably this car seat is mainly designed for for LATCH system or without-base.The canopy is very flimsy. I always thought that apart from providing shade, car seat canopy provides some kind of protection in accidents too. But I doubt this one does.The base recline foot does not rest well on my Honda Accord - even after using towels. When I showed it to car seat inspector at my local police station, he recommanded me to get a different model of car seat. He told me that all the car seats are not going to fit with all types of cars. Therefore, better to check and find out the suitable car seat for your car.Instruction manual is pathetic. Very unorganized, no index table, no technical specification. Some of the parts in pictures do not match with the actual car seat parts (hence makes it very confusing). In many places the instructions mention some part names, but they are not shown in any pictures in the manual (you got to be wondering what is this part anyway). Overall, it's very difficult to make anything head or tail out of the instructions.Instruction manual does not mention compatible stroller(s). So, either you have to call Combi for compatibility or you have rely on vendor's word.",3
"Kiddopotamus Dreamsie Sleeper with Sleeves Microfleece Large, Ivory","I like the weight of fleece, the size is good, and I love that it has arms. What I don't like is the huge head hole- isn't it supposed to save your baby from suffocation, not encourage it.  I ended up sewing and taking the neck in smaller. My son is 1 yr. and the hole is still big for him.",4
"Summer Infant Fox &amp; Friends Classic Comfort Wood High Chair, Espresso Stain",Very good high chair works very good just like we read in description very sturdy and strong to last a long time.,5
The First Years Breastflow Milk Storage Organizer,"I just got it, and put my previously frozen in lansinoh bags breastmilk in it.  The bags were a little too wide, but lots still fit in it, and now they're organized!  This was the only system I could find and the quality seems decent.",4
"Cocalo 8 Piece Crib Set, Turtle Reef","I've ordered a ton of items off amazon over the years and this is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write a review.  I ordered this set for our first child and couldn't be more happy.  His nursery looks so warm and welcoming!  It is rare to find a product that looks even better in person than it does online but this set actually does.  The colors and textures of the fabric are beautiful and really well made.  I've used the blanket that comes with the set for tummy time on the floor and it is plush enough for my son to be comfortable.  I also ordered the matching Hamper and it is adorable - a great way to complete the room.  If you are so inclined, there are companies out there that will hand paint matching letter blocks if you would like to use your child's name as wall art.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone and will definitely be buying more from Cocalo in the future!",5
"Growing Up Green Wood Step Stool, Natural","Beautifully made, solid. A rather low stool however. Unfortunately, too short for my daughter to reach the sink to wash her hands.",4
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"I first purchased another bottle warmer which I promptly returned because it did not work.  I received this bottle warmer as a gift from a friend who has three children, two of which are twins.  So, I figured she knew what was good and what was not.  And she was right, this works well.  I read some of the other reviews of this product but can only say I've had no problems with this.  It's easy to use and always warms the bottle just right...not too hot, not too cold.  I'm very pleased with this product.",5
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","i love this swing , it is so soft and cofortable for my baby. She loves this chair , but the music settings should change , because after 20 min the music stops, and sometimes if i dont turn back on my baby wakes up.",4
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","My only complain is that it is supposed to swing closed by itself, and it doesn't exactly do that it will shut some but not all the way so you have to keep an eye on it.  On the plus side once you get the hang of it it is very easy to open with one hand! A very necessary feature!",4
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","The Avent nipples are great, but I just wish that the description was clearer that the slow flow nipples are actually level 2 nipples and not level 1.  Luckily I will be able to use these later on, but I was hoping to get a slow flow version of the level 1 nipples.  I'm guessing there is no such thing.",3
Fisher-Price Swing N Glider - Cuddle Bunny,"I just absolutely LOVE this swing! We have been putting my son in it since he was 2 weeks old, and it never fails to put him straight to sleep! His favorite is the glider selection. We looked at a lot of swings, read plenty of reviews, and decided on this swing.The selling points of this swing are mainly the fact that you can plug it in (saves a TON of money on batteries!) and that it has two types of swinging action- the regular swing mode and a glider swing mode. it also reclines enough for our newborn, and he didn't need an extra head support, it comes with one! The lowest speed is PLENTY fast and strong, it's all we've used so far. Any time he gets fussy, we just plop him in and he falls instantly asleep! It's a must-have swing!",5
"Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","This is the 3rd Britax car seat I have purchased so I am obviously a fan of Britax but this seat still exceeded my expectations.  I own the Britax Boulevard and another Marathon seat.  The older Marathon model we own, I purchased in 2010 for my 2nd child and they must have re-done the seat because this new Marathon 70-G3 has a better base, fabric cover, and head cushion than the other one I own.  The base is sturdier and easier to stabilize on the seat when installing.  The fabric is much nicer and seems easier to wipe (I don't know how to describe it other than less &#34;fuzzy&#34; and more &#34;sporty&#34; fabric).  The cushioning that is around the head is almost like the Boulevard seat we own.We did take out the infant padding as our baby is on the &#34;chunkier&#34; side and she would get too hot in the seat with it on but we have no complaints.  Britax is still our favorite brand (I have owned others but I've only kept the Britax around).",5
"Dr. Bloom's Chewable Jewels Hexagon Bracelet and Necklace Combo, Emerald","Had high hopes that this would curb my three year old's biting and chewing habit...but to no avail.  The shapes itself is a little too big, it made his shirt wet and he lost interest after a couple of day.  Because of the size, it would hang in front of his face when he played trains/cars on the floor and he would get annoyed with it.  Great idea, just didn't work for us.",3
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),I really thought I was getting a dozen pins..turns out I should have counted the pins in the picture..as there are only 10. I am sad..and I think that they are overpriced. I only use them to mark yarn when I crochet so I will be going back to regular safety pins.,2

"DaVinci Kalani 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","I researched a lot before buying this crib, I was looking for a reasonably priced and a safe crib.Got this crib, it took couple of hours to assemble it, as many other reviewers said, it is really really delicate.It is impossible to assemble this crib without getting some dents here and there. Even a light touch makes a dent.Not sure if it really is worth the price, but there was hardly any other crib in the market in this price range and considered safe.",3
Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen,"I love having a video monitor!  I never thought I would use one, but with the birth of our second child decided we should try it.  We went with this monitor because I loved the fact that you could actually change the angle of the camera, and I thought this would be a useful feature with a two year old.  Turns out I love that feature even more than I thought I would!  I can track my son all over his room without opening the door, which is very useful for quiet time and nap time.  There have been many times I've caught him doing something he shouldn't be, and I've been able to get to him before I would have otherwise.  It's also useful to check in on him to make sure he's asleep without opening the door and waking him up.  I love being able to look in on the baby without opening the door, as he can be a light sleeper sometimes.  It was also useful to check on him when he was crying to tell if he was awake, stuck in the crib slats, or just going through a sleep transition and in the process of settling back down.  If I don't check I could disturb him when he would just roll back over and go back to sleep, and who wants to wake a kid up before they're actually ready to get up?!There are a few things I would change though.  We actually have two units because I wanted a camera in each room.  It's easy to switch back and forth between cameras on the monitor unit, but you can't have two monitors.  So we basically just have an extra monitor in case the first one breaks.  It would have been helpful to know that before we purchased the second whole set, but we ended up getting a good deal on the second set and only paid a little more than we would have if we'd bought an extra camera from Summer.  You can buy the extra camera from Summer, it's not cheap, but definitely worth it in our experience.  I understand why they don't want more than one monitor to work per camera (security reasons) but that would have been nice so we could leave one camera in our bedroom and one downstairs in the family room.  We did get an extra cord with the second set so we do at least have one cord upstairs and one downstairs.  We just take the monitor up at night and down in the morning.  I do recommend leaving it plugged in unless you are outside as the battery won't last for forever.  If you do leave it unplugged, then leave the video off as much as possible or your battery really won't last long.My husband remarked that it would be nice if the display automatically turned on when you pushed the menu button, you'll need to turn on the display to see the menu, which isn't a big deal but gets annoying after a while.The picture can be a little grainy, but I don't need the clearest picture to check on my kids!  The night vision is pretty good, even the instructions say it will work better if there is a nightlight on in the room.You do have to change the volume on the menu so a separate volume button would have been nice.  The volume is pretty loud, even on the lowest setting, especially when you are sleeping, so I put scotch tape over the speaker and that helps a lot.  The louder volumes are useful when you are outside working and don't have the monitor right next to you.The lights do work just fine even with the volume turned completely off.  I actually find them somewhat annoying at night because they are pretty bright in a dark room.  I don't find the LED lights on the camera unit to be a problem at all.  They are barely noticeable, even in a dark room.  The lights on the monitor are more sensitive than they need to be, they light up with the smallest noises.  We have humidifiers in our kids rooms (it's very dry here) and the lights will go on in response to those and the furnace, any white noise.  It can be hard to filter white noise from kid noise based on the just the lights when the volume is turned down.  The lights will also lit up in response to loud noises in the room with the monitor, not just the camera.One thing I've noticed is that the camera will randomly change what it's looking at.  I'll notice sometimes that when I change which camera I'm looking at, the view is different than where I left it.  I'm not sure if when I move one camera the other one moves too or what is going on, it's just strange.Overall, I really enjoy having a video monitor and absolutely love that I can move the camera to check on my son while he plays in his room.  We will be using this monitor for a long time to come!",4

"Munchkin Wood and Steel Designer Gate, Dark Wood/Silver","I think I received a returned item. Still, I like the gate and I've been using it for 6 months.  I purchased this mainly for looks and not much of the features (1 - it works as a baby gate 2 - you have to push in and down a button to open the gate 3 - its held by tension).This gate is installed between 2 stairway banister posts.  I contemplated purchasing the stairway banister post adapters but decided to make my own.  I purchased 8' cedar 1.5&#34;x1&#34; strip at my nearby Menards.  Cut it to length and stained to match my posts.  I cut it so that it would come level with the bottom of the ball at the top of the post.  Next, I screwed the tension feet cups to the wood strips (this is important for the top as the banister post does not provide a tension point near the top) and did the same for the bottom (for uniformity).  Next, I secured the gate between the banister and wood strips.  Using conduit c-clamps that was screwed to the wood strips and secured to the banister with zip ties.  I used black zips to blend but its still noticeable.  It's a trade-off between secure and non-damaging to the home vs. looks (remember, I have 3 kids and they make a daily mess of the house).I made sure that the tension was tight and the gate was secure to my satisfaction.  I was surprised that the gate opened very easily and after a short while (instructions were not in the box) I figured that the top of the gate had to be expanded (i.e. more tension) to close the gap across the top of the gate and frame.  Later I found out this was by design and not a defect of the item I received.Now its works great as a stairway gate.",4
Symphony in B Music Toy,My grandson got one of these for Christmas and loves it - he is 5 and really likes listening to the different instruments play alone and then together.  I bought a second one to have here at my house for when they come to visit.  I personally really like that there is both classical music and some &#34;kid&#34; songs like B-I-N-G-O so that the kids get exposed to some real music.  This is a winner.  I also like that all the instruments can be stored in the space at the back of the orchestra pit.,5
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","Being a first time parents, my husband & I weren't sure which bottles to use. We registered for Avent (which leaked all over our daughter, made her gassy and spit up alot), Gerber (also made her gassy and spit up more) and our third try were the Ventaire. Finally a bottle that worked great! She doesn't drown while eating from a leaking bottle, she spits up less and has less gas! These are the best bottles around. We also use a microwave steam sterilizer on them and they are fine. First, we wash them with the bottle brush and hot soapy water, then sterilize them in the micro and they come out great! I highly recommend!!!",5
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"I bought this after growing frustrated with the squeeze aspirator I got from the hospital.  (Later I read an article that the inside of those can get moldy and gross, so I'm glad I switched.)  It seemed kind of icky to me, after all you're putting a tube in your mouth and sucking out snot, but when your infant is suffering you will do just about anything to make it better.  But it comes with these little filters so you don't get snot in your mouth.  It's completely washable so it won't get gross, any bottle brush will fit right in there.  And you can wiggle it around in your little one's nose as you are sucking, getting much more mucus out than the bulb type.  Admittedly he doesn't like it much, but he didn't like the bulb either, and it makes him feel better.  5 stars, great invention!",5
"Waterproof Baby Bibs with Snaps for Girls &amp; Boys, Gift Box 10 Pack, Solid Colors","Good quality and love the snap buttons and I'm sure they would last longer compare to others using velcro.But it will be much better if there is more girly color, I don't find any pick color which is one draw back as I have a girl!",5
Tiny Love Musical Nature Stroll Toy Bar,"We bought this for our 4 month old (now almost 6 months) and he loves it.  We keep it attached to something in our family room (like his jumparoo), sit him down in his Bumbo Baby Seat, Blue chair, and voila - instant ""play station"" for him.  We also brought it with us on a road trip to grandma's house, which worked out really well.  We haven't actually tried it on the car seat or high chair, but that's just a testament to its versatility.  We chose this version over others because of the music feature and because it had a more ""boyish"" design.",5

Medela Medium Flow Nipples Bulk pack of 5,"I only use the Medela bottles because both of my children drank out of them well in addition to breastfeeding, and then once they were older and used formula the caps make it easy to shake up the bottle and travel with! I needed some more medium flow nipples, so I just quickly ordered these without reading reviews. They came and look like Medela nipples, but are not packaged in any sort of Medela brand packaging which freaks me out a little so I have just been looking at them on the counter for about a week trying to decide if we should use them or not. I would give Medela bottles 5 stars, but the packaging of these 1...the delivery was quick though!",3
Lifefactory Glass Baby Bottles 4 Pack w/ Colored Caps &amp; Stage 2 Nipples (9 oz. &amp; 4 oz.),"I bought these for my daughter when she stopped nursing around 7 months. I love them! They are expensive, but the silicone sleeves make them easier to hold than plain glass bottles. I've been using these for 3 months and they show no signs of wear. My daughter prefers the nipples that come with these to those from her other bottles (although you can swap in a standard nipple if desired). We don't really use the colored caps that come with them much, but they are good if you are on the go a lot.",5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"I received this as a gift for my one month old, we thought it was the coolest thing. Well, if you didnt strap the baby in (and i didnt b/c i always had it on the floor)they always slid sideways.  Mine would not take a nap b/c the strap was too small,so i never used it. After 2 months of having it, it starting making the worst grinding noise when the bubbles would start coming up. The motor sounded like it was going to burn up.  I also thought that the music was too loud even when we had it on low. I returned it and got the  carters sweet daisy cradle and soothe bouncer, we love it and so does my daughter.  Since she rules the house now, everyones happy!!",2

BabyGanics Ultra Absorbent Jumbo Size Diapers - 40 Ct - Size 1,"These diapers are very thin. The inside of the diaper looks similar to the inside of an Honest diaper, but it is thinner, which just makes me paranoid about leaks. Unfortunately I haven't gotten a chance to see how they hold up with a lot pee because my baby hates them! hates them! she screams when she pees just slightly in them and develop a rash right away. No other &#34;green&#34; diaper I have tried has done this. The stretchy tabs are nice but the diaper gets bunched up easily and shifts around, seems cheaply made. Also, blowout are huge in these for my baby, but so far the only diapers that fully contain blowouts 100% of the time are my cloth.",2
Infant Optics DXR-8 Pan/Tilt/Zoom 3.5&quot; Video Baby Monitor With Interchangeable Optical Lens,"-after lots of research i purchased this monitor based on reviews, response from customer service and the features.  we have been using if for a few weeks and have been really pleased-pros: great picture, good range, talk back feature, easy to use, company is easy to contact and deal with, very easy set up, adding a 2nd camera was easy-cons: as everyone has said, the beep when the monitor is turned on, off, or put into sleep mode is terrible; it isnt just a beep, it is a loud 1980's video game beep.  for me it isnt enough to return it, we either leave the screen up all night, or turn it off right when we go to bed and usually dont have to cut it back on during the night more than once or twice.  since we leave the monitor on, it would be nice if the brightness could be dimmed moreoverall, very pleased with this purchase and feel it was worth the money",5
Sleigh Changing Table with Cart - Cherry,"Do NOT buy this product. We bought it as it looked like a great product, until we put it together. The main tables are made of very thin particle board, very flimsy. Main supporting legs broke before anything heavy was even placed on it. Thank God we put it together before the baby was born, this is a MAJOR safety hazzard. I am contacting Amazon and recommending they take this off there site.",1

Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,Pros:1.  The cost2.  Very lightweight3.  Very thin handheld unit4.  The picture quality during the daytime is excellent5.  Very simple to useCons:1.  The night vision does not work.  We had an Angel Care monitor previous to this that displayed the night vision perfectly.  This monitor does not work in the dark.  Do not buy it if you rely heavily on the night function.2.  Build quality is cheap.  You get what you pay for so not a lot to complain about hear.3. The camera is difficult to mount on the wall.  It could really use a slot to be mounted on a tripod.4.  The VOX feature does not work.  I was in our child's room talking loudly for over 5 minutes and the infrared never turned on and the monitor never turned on.Conclusion:Based on the night vision non function and the VOX non function I will be returning this unit.  Only had it for one day and it is not acceptable in my terms for a baby monitor.  I question all the 5 star reviews after receiving this unit. I would bet that many of those were generated by people who have never used this product.,1
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","We purchased this stroller about a month ago. I wanted something for my almost 8 month old daughter that was easy to haul around and took up a small amount of space. The Jet stroller folds nicely and can be carried in one hand. The height of the handles are great for my husband and me. Also, I love the five-point harness for my active girl! Some frustrations are that the shade really doesn't cover her at all, she we still put a sun hat on her. Also, I sometimes kick the wheels while walking. Overall, it is a nice back-up stroller, and is perfect for traveling or quick trips to the store, etc. We bought the Retro Red pattern, which is very gender neutral.",4
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could. We got this with the B-Safe Infant Car Seat as part of a promotion so it was a &#34;travel system.&#34; We love that it can have the B-Safe connected to it during the infant stage, but it also has a great &#34;big&#34; seat for older babies/little ones. My favorite part is that baby can face either direction - it was important to me that I could see my baby, especially during the early days. So many configurations! Love the idea that it can be used so many ways as our family grows. We don't use the cup holder - we bought the stroller organizer - but otherwise have used and enjoy everything about this stroller. There were issues with the break locking on our original frame, but when I called Britax their customer service was great and immediately sent a new frame. This stroller is easy to assemble and has features that other strollers don't have or they charge extra.",4

"Munchkin Quick Install 26&quot; Gate, Black","We have used three kinds of baby gates.The standard cheap-o wooden tension gate, like this:  http://www.amazon.com/Evenflo-Position-Lock-Wood-Safety/dp/B000056JHI/ref=sr_1_3?s=baby-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1362660640&sr;=1-3&keywords;=baby+gateThis type of gate gets warped after a lot of use and doesn't hold as good.  But it is cheap and lasted us 2+ years.A wall mounted gate like this: http://www.amazon.com/GMI-Keepsafe-36-Inch-Expansion-Gate/dp/B0001J05JQ/ref=sr_1_12?s=baby-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1362660801&sr;=1-12&keywords;=baby+gateTwo problems with this gate - it is sometimes hard to close and it is hard to keep mounted with frequent use.  If you install it in wood or at a stud location, it eliminates the second problem.  If you can get it mounted properly, it is super sturdy.Now to this gate.  This is such a sturdy gate.  There is a bit of a learning curve on how to close it quickly, but other than that we love this gate and will be ordering another soon.  I think of the ones we have used, this one is hands down the best.",5
"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch","After much research, I thought this monitor seemed like the best one out there and so I put it on our baby registry.  We received it and it worked for all of one week before the sound cut out.  A baby monitor without sound is useless, but I probably didn't have to tell you that.  When it was working it was pretty neat, and so I returned the broken one for a new one.  The new one arrived and again stopped working after about one week.  This time it kept telling me that the monitor was &#34;out of range&#34; and we could never get a picture.  I will not be giving this baby monitor a third chance, and I recommend that you don't even waste your time or money on this product.  Too bad:(",1
Graco Secure Coverage Digital Baby Monitor with 1 Parent Unit,"I was told that all monitors have white noise/static and feedback. Not so! This monitor is very quiet, while providing excellent audio of your baby. I even have to check sometimes to make sure it's still working because it's so quiet. The battery life could be longer, but I keep it plugged in most of the time. The first night I used it, it started beeping around 5am to tell me the battery was dying. Kind of annoying, but now I know to keep it plugged in for overnight use. Basically, this monitor does everything I wanted it to. I even took it on vacation with me to my dad's house and it worked perfectly.

He's only 12 lbs. now, so I'm not sure how he'll do when he gets bigger, but for now it's great.I tried using the sling the first time and he really hated it, though. I think it was the feeling of being in the air, maybe? Ayways, I just hold onto him and he does fine.It's a good price and very practical.",5
PRK Products Inc Universal Baby Bottle and Sippy Cup Organizer,"Okay I am a big diapers.com girl so this was my first purchase on Amazon because I have heard about this product from several of my friends and dipaers.com currently does not sell it.  I also am one of those people that does a ton of research before purchasing a product. Of course this is done when Brandt is put down to bed (lol...).Okay, so I found this product reviewed on SEVERAL sites. I was actually amazed at how many sites I did find it. The Baby Center is always my ""go to site"" if I really want to learn about a product. And as always, the baby center did not let me down. I also have read all the reviews that the people have posted to this site and this is what I am going to tell you.(1) It is super sturdy (2) It is kind of tall so i can see if you had an older kitchen it most likely would not fit in your kitchen cabinets. It would not fit in my Mother's but fits perfectly in mine. I would still suggest purchasing it even if you have to have it on your counter, a pantry would work great as well (3) I would not say it saves you a lot of space BUT what it does do is solve the falling bottles problem when you open up your kitchen cabinet doors. Which is one of my favorite parts about this product. Now I can reach in to grab a bottle with ease -vs.- knocking ones all over the place (4) I can see what people are taking about when they talk about the bottles not always dropping down. this is true, once in awhile it kind of catches but honestly it takes a half of a second to flick it with your finger to resolve the issue. And like I said, it happens only once and awhile...and who cares when it does, it is not a big deal.(5) I love that it works with sippy cups as well. For ONCE my money spent on a baby product will last me for a few years which is really hard to come by when dealing with baby products. Brandt is only in bottles so I have not tried it yet with sippy cups but cannot imagine it not working great. (6) Okay, the whole I like my bottles put together issue. I am a gal that always stores my nipples and lids apart from the bottles. When my bottles come out of the dishwasher they have that wet stuff still inside so the last thing I want to do is cap it in .... YUCK!  And of course, I do not want to try to stick a towel in there and dry it all the way so my stuff is always stored apart. This organizer is great for that because it helps dry the bottles so to speak as well as the basket because of the holes. This is a huge selling point for me -vs.- some of the other moms who like to store it all together.  by the way, it does store my prince lionheart 7 oz bottles with all the bells and whistles so maybe you have to have one of those super tall bottles to not let it fit???I really think this is a great product and I am very happy that I purchased it.  I hope my two cents worth helps :-)",5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,This swing is great. i bought it as a gift for three friends after my sister got one. the two motion options are great as you never know which one teh baby would like. the graphics are also great and the kids just love the colors. the only negative is that it eats up the batteries.,5

If a burp cloth is being used for actual burping of a baby, you want something that can take a good hit of baby puke.These diapers worked great!  They are absorbent, soft, an at a great price.  I highly recommend them.  In fact, I will probably buy another pack and start phasing out our old burp cloths.",5
"MAM Trends Silicone Pacifier, Blue, 0-6 Months, 2-Count",My kids love these. Much more attractive than most pacifiers. I think they stay in their mouths better than others.,5
"Baby Fanatic Pacifier Clip, Ohio State","clip is good quality, cute, and will work well for my son's pacifiers. My husband is a huge OH fan so it is perfect.",5
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","Odd, this product seems to be high quality except for the motor! It plays nice music (and I'm easily annoyed), deep, and well padded. There isn't much of a low setting for the swinging. When I first put my little one in at 9lbs she seemed to hate it...it swung too hard. But I tried it out of desperation one night because I needed to eat (she was slightly colicky)...and she went right to sleep. So from then on, while mommy ate, it was her dinner nap spot. After about two months of use, it started to squeek (annoying). Then shortly thereafter, it just stopped swinging. She is only about 13lbs and 3 months so it wasn't because of weight and we didn't use all that much. After I looked through these reviews I saw many bad issues with the Snuggabunny, even one with a electrical fire!!! I would buy something more reliable. Sad, I thought Fisher-Price was a decent company.",2
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,I looked forever to find the right gate for my dog.  I have a wider doorway and I wanted a walk through one and this one is very solid.  I have baseboards and quarter molding so I just mounted it about an inch of the floor and I really haven't had a problem with the bar.  The door way is great and the extenders work fantastically.  I would highly!!! recommend this gate.,5
diapees &amp; wipees Diaper Pouch with Wipes Case - Blue Zoo Animals,"I like this product, but thought it would be more like the LL Cole Pod's systems. This definatly isn't. Made of good quality material though. And the designs are super cute. I work outside of the home, so my baby has most of his essentials at the daycare providers house, so this is perfect to slip into my purse to have the essentials during my travels. Also great when you don't want to lug around your huge diaper bag. These bags only fit the wipes and the diapers, nothing else. I would prefered if I could also fit a diaper rash cream tube in there as well. But good quality product.",4
"NUK Silicone Animal Faces 2 Pack BPA Free Pacifier, Size 2, Colors May Vary","These are some of the only pacifiers that my baby will use. Beware, though, my baby boy got a pink one and a yellow one. No worries, we still let him have it!",5
"OXO Tot Sprout Chair, Orange/Birch","We bought this for our son when he turned 6 months old. He is 17 months now, and I can say that it is one of the best purchases we've made for him. The main thing I was looking for was a highchair that was generally easy to clean and didn't have a lot of fabric with nooks and crannies. Our son has suffered from reflux since he was 5 weeks old and it is very easy for him to throw up. This chair has saved my sanity when it comes to clean up. If I had bought one that made that kind of situation any more difficult, I probably would've thrown it in the lake out of frustration. I just take the tray off when he's done eating and rinse the top off in the sink, then do the same with the removable cushion, dry them, and done!I will say that when food gets under the cushion, it can get stuck in the velcro and it's really hard to get out, but I use a natural cleaning solution of vinegar, baking soda, and water and it seems to help. It would also be nice if the strap in between the legs could be removed to throw in the washer with the others when needed, but I just use the same cleaning solution on it.I love that it looks nice and I can leave it out when we have company and not worry about it being an eyesore too.  I know it will las us a long time as well. We may need to replace the cushions at some point, but still worth it.Overall, we love this highchair and recommend it to our friends with children all the time!",5
"Safety 1st Deluxe Comfort Crib Mattress, White",The third one we own.  The first has lasted over 2 years now and cannot complain at all.  Very high quality and a good buy.  If you want a mattress that is worth buying this is it,5
Infantino Merry Monkey Gym,my great grand  daughter loves playing with the animals. she is six months old. i would recommend it to others. it is safe and i enjoy watching her play with it and cooing to it when she gets one with her feet or hand.,5
"Boppy Cottony Cute 2-Sided Slipcover, Polka Stripe Green",This pillow cover is super cute and soft!  It fits my Boppy pillow perfectly! I'm quite pleased with this purchase,5
"Bright Starts Around We Go Activity Station, Tropical Fun",We love this toy.  I got it for my 1st child when she was 6 months old and she loved it immediately.  She stood in it and played with the toys at each spot - learned to walk and then to run around it.  Once she was actually walking we pulled the seat off and left it as a playtable for her...she constantly played with it.  She loved having snack in the little snack tray and all her little friends that came to play always ran to the table...now #2 is here and loves it just as much!  Its the same big hit the second time around! Fabulous toy - worth the money - very durable.  Easy to clean (except the keys in the piano part those are more difficult).  Good on carpet tile and hardwood.,5
"MAM Single Pack Baby Bottle, 4 Months, 11 Ounce, Colors May Vary",So much easier to wash and assemble then the anti colic ones.  They aren't as cute but you have to sacrifice somethings right? :),5
Kidsme Food Feeder Replacement Sac (Small size) (2 per package),"This item is so much better than the mesh feeders that are sold in the baby stores. Sturdier,  way easier to wash. This product is small but perfect for a beginning eater. In probably goibg to invest I the larger one for when she gets older.",5
"Bummis Super Whisper Wrap, White, 30 Pounds",We are now on our third size of bummis for our twin boys. The Bummis make cloth diapers easier than disposables (especially with the help of a diaper service). We dread having to deal with disposables with their heavy perfumes.,5
"Disney Music and Lights Walker, Sweet as Hunny","Tried baby on it at 4 months old but was way too high for her even at the lowest setting. She wasn't able to sit on her own by then so I figured she was just too small. At around 5 months, we placed a pillow under her so she wouldn't be hanging because she liked to play with the toys it came with. She is over 6 months now and she still loves to play with it. She reaches the floor with her tipy toes only, and only scoots back but she likes to stay in it and play. The tray it comes with allows for feeding her cereal or place other toys for her to play with. I bought it at a Walmart and I'm very happy with it.",4
"Baby Aspen Little Expeditions Plush Rattle Lovie with Crinkle Leaf, Ekko The Elephant","This is a cute elephant. But the color is very blue. The picture looks gray, but the elephant and blanket are actually blue. Does not work for me because I'm looking for a gift for a baby girl. A bit frustrated that I have to return this one, and continue my search.",1
Fisher-Price Step &amp; Play Piano,This is a terrific toy.  I had a saucer for my baby and decided I wanted to try this out with her.  Well she loved her saucer cause she likes to jump but she loves this a hundred times more because when she jumps she hears music.  Then my 2 1/2 year old son comes running over and he will play right along with her.  It gives me time to do  some dishes and we are all happy!  This a awesome toy and I think it helps little ones play with their ever so admired big brother or sister.,5
"Skip Hop Grand Central Diaper Bag, Black","I wanted to upgrade my current diaper bag because, well, I was running out of room!  My son is nearly 1 year old and I don't know if I'm crazy but I seem to bring a LOT of stuff with me when we go places.  This bag looks great (my hubs isn't unhappy to carry it) and is HUGE.  I mean it, it's enormous.  Sometimes I pack it with more just because I can.  I love the material - wipes clean very easily.  My ONLY gripe is that it won't fit on my stroller, but I can live with that.  Love this bag!",5
BRICA Deluxe Kick Mats (2 pack),"Easy to install, quality is great, washable fabric and price point was affordable. I would recommend these to anyone with children in the back seat!!",5
Lamaze High-Contrast Panda Rattle,"My daughter loves this rattle, but two months after getting it, I am going to have to buy another one.  The threads are coming apart and the fabric is shredding.  I guess it is my fault as I have put it in the washing machine (on gentle cycle) instead of spot clean as listed on the cleaning instructions...but since we have pets, I prefer a more thorough clean.  I just think it should last a little longer, but overall very pleased.",4
"SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket, Jewel Tone Owls, Turquoise","The traditional Carter's receiving blankets are no good--awkwardly shaped, hard to maneuver, and at 5 weeks, my very petite baby has grown out of them, wriggling free in the middle of the night, which might actually be a safety issue--on top of being disruptive to sleep for cranky babies.  This one was an instant success.  Perfectly square, thick, and unwiggle-able!  Hooray!  Ambien for babies!",5
Kiddie Kangaroo Travel Storage Accessory Stroller in Black,"My Jeep Wrangler Umbrella stroller came with these built in. I loved them so much that when I upgraded to a quality (ahem...) stroller I bought these. Perfect for storing sippy cups and miscellaneous toys that she ""couldn't live without"" during a shopping trip. Doesn't add any excess size to your stroller too. These don't stick out, and they fold up with the stroller, no problems at all. Definitely would recommend to a friend or family!",4
"Itzy Ritzy Snack HappensSnack Mini Reusable Snack Bag, Social Circle Pink, 2-Count","We have a few of these in various patterns and love them.  I do want to note they are not as sealed as plastic bags or tupperware items so for anything that is 'juicy', I wouldn't use this!!  We have done orange slices successfully but make sure the bag isn't being placed somewhere where the oranges will get squished and juice!We have used them for carrots, snack mixes, apples, oranges, grapes, cereal (dry), and cookies, etc....  SO far so good, but they will allow air to pass in so things will get stale if not consumed within a day or two.Easy to wash and just SO cute! I love that I have had a box of plastic snack bags for almost 2 years because I just don't need them!!! I love that these are BPA free and love that they are zipper!! We bought some that had velcro and the velcro wears out and holds 'yuckiness'. I do wish they made these in the USA, perhaps if several of us write in they will take note and bring the manufacturing back here!!!",5
"Graco Blossom 4-In-1 Seating System, Sapphire",This is a fantastic product. It is a breeze to assemble and the multiple configurations make it worth it. Definitely a must have!!!!,5
Evenflo Comfort Select Auto-Cycling Breast Pump,"I bought this one, with my first son, and of couse the suction stopped after about two weeks. I have tried 3 other Evenflo pumps (both electric and manual) and not a single one has lasted longer than 2 weeks before they lost the suction. Don't waste your money. It's tempting because of the price, but read the reviews! Don't get stranded in the middle of the night with engorgment and having to send your husband out to find one!",1
"Itzy Ritzy Toddler Car Seat Cover, Rodeo Drive","we have a Recaro ProRide convertible seat and it's incredibly inconvenient, not to mention difficult, to get the cover off and wash it but if you have a toddler in this seat every day it needs to be washed quite often. we tried many other car seat covers but they just didn't fit the large top on the Recaro seat until this one. this is the only cover that we've found that even comes close to fitting the ProRide.  it doesn't fit perfectly but it's so easy to get on and off that it's still worth the price.",5
"Stokke Tripp Trapp Baby Set, Black","Disappointing to learn after buying this baby set bracket that the instruction manual says not to use without the harness which is sold separately. So basically you need to buy the chair, the bracket and then harness to complete the entire set safely.  A great way to rip off the customer. The next thing you know they'll say the screws for the chair are sold separately.",1
"Baby Einstein Rattle and Teethe, Caterpillar, Colors May Vary","This teether has gotten a fair amount of action in my house.  My older son enjoyed it as a baby (from about five months to fourteen-ish months).  He now brings it to his younger brother (eight months old) who happily accepts it.  Of course, he's take anything his brother game him, but I'll give the toy the benefit of the doubt.  It's easy for an older infant (not the very young/small ones) to grab and chew and the rattling noise always pleases.We don't put it in the refrigerator since it doesn't hold the cold for long and it seems to be just as good at room temperature.If you're looking for a teether/toy for a younger infant, try theSuper Yummy Teether.  It's easy to hold and the nubbles and handle are both chewable.  (Younger infants tend to hold the nubbles and chew the handle.  It's the reverse for older infants.Bottom line:  It's a good teether for older/bigger infants.  Babies do like variety, so get more than one teether and swap them out.",4
"Tadpoles Ultra-Soft Plush Baby Blanket, Light Blue",This blanket is very soft as stated.  But it is not as thick as I wanted.  The picture makes it look as if it is very plush but it's not.,3
Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,"We were all the rage at the airport driving our daughter through the terminal on the suitcase.  The strap strikes me as a bit expensive for what it is, essentially a T luggage strap with hooks on the end, but it worked perfectly.Our daughter enjoyed riding around the airport and I enjoyed pulling her quickly instead of putting her in a carrier on my back and limiting how much can be carried over my arm.The straps are sturdy and the directions are very clear.  Simple to use and works great.  I definitely recommend it.",5
Munchkin XTRAGUARD Dual Locking Appliance Latch,Keeps our 18 mo old out of the fridge! Our fridge doors are a little uneven but it still works amazing. Great purchase.,5
Bright Starts Flutter and Link Friend,This keeps my daughter's attention for a little while. She is 9 months now and has used it for a few months now.,4
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","The seat is small, easy to fold up and easy to clean. I use it during ECFE classes, in restaurants, and at grandma's house. I like that the height is perfect for him to sit at the table (without the tray) at most restaurants. It's the smallest seat that I could find.",5
Clay Handprint &amp; Footprint Keepsake Photo Wall Frame - Black,"I didn't expect this to be a Tiffany's quality item, but i also didn't expect the frame to come scuffed up right out of the box.  I'm also worried about the other reviewers who mentioned the clay cracking.  I'm likely returning this.",1
"3 Sprouts Laundry Hamper, Deer","We love 3 sprouts and have many many many of the items. Love the overall design and functionality of the hamper, love that the opening turns into large handles. Only complaint is that the goat image is screen printed onto the canvas vs all of the other bins and caddies that have layered felt cutouts sewn/attached on.UPDATE: Had to come back and add another star because we do REALLY LOVE the functionality of the hamper. Honestly, I understand now why the hampers are screen-printed on vs sewn on felt---the hamper can stand up to damp/wet clothes very well, as well as being stored in a wet area (like ours which is kept in our twins' bathroom). Also, I should note that we used 3 Sprouts for all of our girls' storage in the playroom. We have 4 of the large toy bins, 3 of the square bins and 3 of the caddies. So, in our case, we immediately noticed the difference in construction when compared to the rest of the line. But, even if you are like us and are doing an entire room with 3 Sprouts, the hampers still match well and are very cute, so do not be put off by the reviews about the image being printed on.",4
"Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Play Mat, Jumbo",I bought this for my LO to play on. I have two dogs and a large area rug that my dogs like to lay on so I wanted something to put down to prevent dog hair from getting all over my LO. The underside collects A LOT of dog hair though. My son loves the toys that came attached to it though. I like that the toys are removable and the blanket it is washable. I do not think I would recommend this to a friend though. Is a waste of money.,3
Elegant Baby Plush Microfiber Blankie - Pastel Blue,"registered for this blanket for our new little one.  It is great fabric but only 20x20 in size, more like a spit cloth then a blanket.",2
Ruffled Circles Monthly Baby Bodysuit Stickers,Im on baby number two and feel awful I don't take nearly enough pictures the second time around.  These have been a great way to track his growth and a fun way to take his picture each month.  We put them on a white onsies and take on the day of the month he was born.,5
Barin Toys Wooden Teether Sticks,"DISCLAIMER:  My baby is HIGHLY sensitive to many hypoallergenic things...If this is your baby, read on.  If not, you're lucky and this toy gets 5 Stars!---My baby and I really love this toy.  However, baby was very allergic to this toy. This is the only reason I can't give it 5 stars.  It's only raw wood and rope but my baby was allergic.  I want to because when she first got it handed to her she stayed entertained for 15 minutes.  15 Minutes!! That is gold to any parent.  I sprayed it with vinegar (to kill bacteria).  Then, washed it  with soap and water.  Sadly, after she played with it that first time, she had a rash around her mouth. Booo!So, I wrote to the seller and asked for explicit products, if any, were used (since it it only made of raw wood and rope).  They wrote back immediately.This was the response AND it came with an authorization for a refund:&#34;This is unfinished european wood specie - alder wood. It's locally harvested. No chemicals and no wax used.Rope is pure cotton, unbleached.This toy doesn't contain allergens.For proper handling try to rinse it every use when it's not in use.You can quickly rinse it with bowling water to kill all dirt and bacteries (like pacifier).&#34;THIS WORKED!  I had no idea this would work but voila! it did!  I boiled the water, added the toy.  Let it boil for about 2 minutes and then, drained the water, took out the toy and rinsed it off.  Let it dry and gave it to her under close supervision.  Nothing happened!  Whatever allergen was there was boiled out!Now my baby is as happy as a clam.  Sometimes, I wet the toy first then put it in the freezer for her to teethe one.  It helps!I wrote this to help other parents with sensitive children (*as allergies in the USA have risen by 600% in the last 20 years and doctors don't know why).  This is a great toy and would love for other parents to enjoy it too.The seller also offered this invaluable information to highly sensitive babies like mine: &#34;P.S. Some wood species are allegric. For example, birch, maple and walnut has different strenght of allergy.Birch, maple has moderate allegric reaction. Pine and walnut has low reaction.&#34;Good luck with the baby's teething!",4
2 in 1 Professional Clinical RY230 Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead and Surface,"It takes less than a second to read your body temperature without actually contact it. It's a bit pricey, but I am satisfied with my purchase.",4
"UPPAbaby G-Series Stroller Travel Bag, Black","We opted for this name brand case over the off-brand. Good choice. The fit is perfect, and not too snug to actually place the stroller in and zip up with ease. Being a soft case, there is no structural protection. Our stroller's cup holder was smashed in a compromising position under other luggage. Since most water bottles are oval shaped, that's a bummer. Recommed that you take the cup holder off before packing the stroller in.There is no shoulder strap. This is really the only design flaw. The two handles are supposed to work as a shoulder strap, but they're not quite long enough.The plastic ID card holder fits a business card perfectly. Glad I stuck one in at the gate as the check in guy didn't really check it in and they were able to identify the luggage by using the card.Overall, a good product for sure. There's a lot to be said for soft cases that fit the prodcut perfectly.",4
Full Coverage all-in-one Hands-Free Pumping Bra &amp; Nursing Tank by Rumina Nursingwear - Black X-Large,"this tank does just what it says! The built in bra isn't the greatest support for larger breasts but the convenience is unbeatable! The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because after just 2 washes (following manufacturer's instructions) it has begun to completely unravel at the bottom. Great product, but for the price I'm wishing it was more durable.",4
Quinny Buzz Footmuff - Black,"I took a chance because some of the other reviewers said it fit their umbrella stroller but this does not fit a Maclaren umbrella stroller.  This is a wonderful item so I had to give it 5 stars.  It's like a sleeping bag and if you live in a cold region, this is a wonderful way to keep baby warm without having to put on tons of layers.  These are so popular in Europe and I'm so glad the concept if finally catching on more in the US.The holes that the waist strap goes through is so close together on the foot muff.  I extended the waist strap as far as I could on my stroller but there is no way my baby would fit.  If you have a Quinny stroller they I highly recommend this. Funny, you would think Quinny would make a universal one too because the quality is good and they would make a lot of money on it!",5
"Baby Starters Plush Snuggle Buddy, Blue Monkey","This is my daughter's ""lovey.""  She received it as a gift from her grandmother and has been super attached to it since she was about 7 months old.  The Sugar N Spice/Mary Jane-ish doll has adorable pigtails for chewing, a fuzzy skirt with a silk underside for great textures to rub.  It also has a decent sized tag which is also great for rubbing.  I agree with the  review about the dog hair getting stuck in the face but it does wash up real well.  We have 3 of these now and I rotate them between the wash and try to get them all evenly worn.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son has been enjoying Sophie for about 3 months now.  He is currently 6 months old and this is by far one of his favorite toys.  This toy is very easy for him to grab with those little fingers and he loves chewing on legs, ear, horns and mouth.  He also loves the squeak, I can always get a smile out of him by bringing Sophie to his attention.  Sophie is also very easy to clean if dropped, which, lets face it, happens quite often at this age!",5
The First Years Everywhere Gate,"A lil more expensive, but works great!  Our climbing toddler could not climb over the gate and was high enough that he couldn't get out.",5
,"This beautifully engraved certificate holder was the perfect gift to preserve lasting memories.  It was purchased as a baptismal gift.  Customer service was prompt, efficient and courteous. this will definitely be my go-to gift in the future.",5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",We had the Chico's car seat and tried the Chico double stroller since I have a 2 year old. It was way too heavy and too large for the space in my Explorer...(can you believe it!) So I had done some research and found the Joovy.  I LOVE it...!! It fit my Chico as stated and I couldn't be happier. Its most importantly light weight and folds up small. Don't forget the rear seat you won't be disappointed.,5
HALO SleepSack Wearable Blanket for Babies - Fleece BLUE LARGE,Very comfortable material. Not too thick and just perfect for a little cooler days. Typical halo quality and very soft.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"I started putting my son in this at 6 weeks.  He is really strong, a big baby, and loves to move.  He would only go in it for short amounts of time.  Now at 3 months he loves it!  He bounces like crazy in it.  He doesn't play with anything in it as he is too young but he loves to jump in and move himself all around.  I did a ton of research on these and I'm really glad I picked this vesion (I knew I wanted Fisher Price based on reviews - I just couldn't decide which one!).  But the best feature of this one is that the seat supports his neck - it's the only version that comes up taller.  He likes to rest his head on neck support.  I'm sure it's because he is younger but I'm glad I did pick this one (I probably wouldn't have been able to use so quick had I picked another one and my son needs this to get some of his energy out).",5
Age 1-4 Boys Baby Kids Striped Polo Shirt + T-strap Pant 2-pc Cute Outfit (80/6-12 months),this product fit well and looks very handsome!  sent as gift to friend and they tried it on first thing!  he loves wearing it.  it is comfortable and easy to get on.,5
SOHO Curious Monkey 5 in 1 Deluxe Diaper Bag *Limited time offer*,"I actually didn't buy this for myself. I didn't buy this for a friend. I bought this for my husband's ex-wife. LoL She was expecting and funds were tight since she has 3 children already, 2 of which are my step-children. I heard thru the grapevine she still needed a few things, and a diaper bag was one of them. So I bought it. And wired $100 into her account so she could finish up the shopping before the new baby got here. 2 weeks later I got a phone call from a strange number and it was, of course, her. She thanked me profusely and loved the bag with all its storage and accessories. I'm giving it 5 stars because it really is a bargain, and when I went to get the kids for vacation, she was carrying it. It is nice, and convenient, and all encompassing.",5
Inspired Ideas BABY CozyWedge Crib Bumper in Blue,"We love it enough to buy another for baby no. 2 due later this year. The traditional bumper obliterated my view from the doorway and I didn't like to think that baby couldn't see out either. This was perfect for them to see out, for us to see them and it kept toys and paci's inside the crib too.The cover is easy to wash and I suppose I can concede that it's a pain to put all the foam inserts back in, but not so bad I would lower stars. We love this product!!",5
"Maxi Cosi Rodi AP Booster Car Seat, Origami Rose","This car seat is for kids of 30-120 pounds that are up to 57 inches in height.It's easy to put together, very cushiony in the head and on the sides, it's comfortable, and easy to use.The one major con for this seat is that it doesn't latch in the way that a car seat would or other booster seats. This means that your child must be ready to transition from the regular car seat and heavy enough to weight down this car booster seat.",4
MAM Fast Flow Nipple - 2 Pack,"It was great my boy loves it so I'm satisfy with that ,I bought and it was a great buy because its not expensive and really good product so I recommend this to anyone, that wants to change to a bottle this is the product for your baby .",5
"Stork Craft Tuscany 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, White",Our crib arrived two weeks ago and the pre drilled holes do not align on the bottom .  After five calls totaling two hours wait time they have not been able to get me a resolution.  This unit was manufactured in Vietnam and did not have the necessary QC to make it go together properly.Stork Craft subs out their defective part replacements to an out side company and make it impossible to get to either a customer service rep or Stork Craft employee to discuss problems...they are impossible to deal with.,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this ladybug for my daughter who is almost 3 and she loves it.  My 4 month old son has the turtle one which is great too!,5
"Summer Infant Elite DuoMat for Car Seat, Black","Don't put this in the washer -- we purchased two of these to protect our minvan's leather seats from our boys' car seats.  They've both held up and other than the surface stains from spills, they were both in the same basic condition they were when we purchased them two years ago.  At least until my wife threw one of them into the washer.  The duomat got stuck between the washer's tub and outer wall and made a horrendous racket -- nearly burned out our new washer.  The washer tore up the mat, so we had to purchase a replacement.Our minivan's leather seats have been well protected by the two DuoMats we purchased two years ago.The DuoMats we purchased were a great investment.",5
Sunshine Kids Radian65 Convertible Car Seat - Champagne,"We bought the Sunshine Kids Radian 80 last year for our oldest son.  We really liked that one.  We decided to get the Radian 65 this time around for our second son to save a little money.  We have two more kids that will be growing into these two car seats.  Yes, they are heavy, but it's not the end of the world.  I am 8 months pregnant and just had to move both of the SunShine Kids car seats by myself into my mother's car.  It was fine, not a big deal.  The straps are real nice, they don't twist.  Both of my boys, ages 5 and 4 can completely strap themselves in and get themselves out, which is very much needed.  I feel like I am offering my kids the most safety I can with these car seats, for a very long time.  I think it is super important to keep my kids (any kids for that matter) in a five point harness for as long as possible.",4
"Adiri BPA Free Natural Nurser Ultimate Bottle Stage 3 Orange, Fast Flow (6+ months)",I purchased this item for my daughter who is 9month old.  I daughter has been breastfed this birth and has had a bottle irregularly.  At about 6months my daughter refused a bottle.  I had read about this bottle and was willing to give anything a try- however it was unsuccessful.  Through trial and error I discovered my daughter like a latex nipple and I have found that the playtex bottle with drop in's work best.,1
Medela Breastmilk Collection and Storage Bottles 8oz (250ml) - 2 Each,"These are good for my &#34;morning pump&#34; which produces a lot of milk.  Easy to read and clean.  Only downside is that when they get heavier and fuller, I have a hard time keeping my breast shield suctioned on!  But there are worse problems.",5

Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail,"It's great for our purposes, but definitely needs the deodorant in the lid. We also empty and reline it outside, spraying it with Lysol and dumping soda in it. That helps a lot.",3
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","This is great! It's super cute, and very functional. It stays on the faucet great. We have one at our house, and one at my parents for baby's bath time over there. No issues in either location with two different showers. It stays on great and you can start the shower without any problem through the top of the whale. I'd definitely recommend!",5
"Crazy Cuddly Wolf Melamine 4 Piece Dish Set, Crazy Cuddly Wolf","Love this set for it's cuteness. The plate has really good curved sides so it's my go-to plate.  The cup is adorable but the top is too difficult to get off, so I just use it as a two handled cup, no lid. You can't put the spoons in the dishwasher or they kind of melt, nothing unique about that, it's one of the ""not cool"" things about melamine.",4

Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"Well built, this gate works perfectly across our extra wide doorway.  Easy to install and very easy to open and close for access.",5
"Munchkin Feeding Set, 15 Pack",This is a great little set for I purchased for my one year old son.  The plates are a great size and he is easily able to drink out of the little cups.  The bowls are a great size.  They are sturdy and hold up well in the dishwasher and to everyday use.,5
"The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Infant Pacifier, Blue/Green","These are the only """"binkies"""" my little one will take. We to use soothes in addition to these but she refuse them. We've given them to her since she was born and she still uses them (she's eight months old now). I was worried about using pacifiers because I breastfeed but we've never had any issues with nipple confusion. They are durable and easy to clean.",5

Playtex Baby The First Sipster Spill-Proof 7 OZ Cup: Boy Colors,"It would seem obvious that a sippy cup could be, you know, SIPPED OUT OF.But alas, this cup, while admirably spill-proof is also impossible to drink out of. I was wondering why my boy - who doesn't have too much trouble with his bottle - wasn't making any dent in the fluid using this cup. So I decided to fill it with water and try it myself. As it turns out, you probably need a vacuum pump to get any appreciable volume of liquid out of the thing.What do you call a sippy cup that you can't drink out of?Worthless.",1
Soho Sage &amp; Brown Suede Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"Gave this as a gift for our grandson's nursery it is so nice the colors and the tetures in the comforter are very comfy,it has held up well also.",4
"Sugarbooger Peek-A-Boo Silverware Set, Orange Slice","great set of toddler silverware,  the bowl of the spoon and size of the fork is actually deeper but smaller compared to the other  toddler silverware sets from sugarbooger, which i prefer - it's the perfect size for my 3-year-old daughter.  although the company says to hand wash these only, we've thrown these in the dishwasher and they've come out fine.  i do wish the container they came with had the magnetic lock like the other sugarbooger utensil sets.",4
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I wasn't sure if I wanted to cloth diaper at first. Due to time, whatever excuse I could find. But I was going to stay at home so I figured I'd save some money and keep chemicals from being on my sons skin. The first time I order three of these and one of the diaper covers with velcro. Well the snaps definitely won the debate here. I should have order a four of these, the velcro wears out rather quickly. While the snaps on these are sturdy and even easier to use then the little metal snaps on onesies (they're a little bigger so its easier to snap together.) (:  Make diapering simple and fast. I have use the first size 1 up to about 6 months, And now using size 2 on my 9 month old. I have them on the second snap in so they will last till hes potty trained! Love love love these diaper covers!",5

The Sleeping Sheep Baby Gift Basket,"This is a perfect Easter basket for a new-born baby.  The gift is beautifully packaged, and the products are of the highest quality.",5
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Bouncer, My Little Snugabunny",This is a great bouncer! It is soft and cradles the baby snug. You have to manually move it to make it actually &#34;bounce&#34;. The toy bar is excellent at keeping baby's attention with lights and music and eventually will be able to bat at the toys. I chose the rainforest so it would work both with a boy and a girl. Probably the nicest bouncer we looked at!,5
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","This tub is a lifesaver.  It allows you to bath your newborn without any help, thanks to the hammock feature.  It is also a great buy.  I would highly recommend this tub and no other.I would like to address some of the complaints I saw in some of the other reviews.  The size is fine.  You can't get a more ""compact"" tub.  After all, your baby does have to fit in it.  You should never trust the plug anyway.  Just use a good thermometer.  And all you have to do is turn the tub to get rid of any excess water after draining the majority of it by unplugging it.  So, there are no significant complaints with this product.  It does the job and well.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","I thought this was very easy to put together, and it looks better then the plastic gates and the swinging door verses the having to move the whole gate is wonderful.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",I LOVE this for my almost 7 month old daughter!  Thank God I didn't buy a similar booster product at WalMart for more than double the price!Pros:1. The whole thing is hard plastic.  It's ridiculously easy to clean.2. There is a piece on the tray that snaps off and goes right in the dishwasher.  Easy!3. The whole thing is very portable.  We take this to restaurants everywhere.  We have one of those chairs that clips onto the table and this is by FAR a superior product in every way.4. Has 3 height adjustments so this seat will last from first solid (providing you're starting at the recommended 6 months.  Probably not good for a 4 month old.) until your child is ready to sit without a booster.Cons:1. The only thing I would change is that the straps to secure baby in are a little scary until you put the tray on.  I'd really like the waist tethers to be anchored to the back of the seat instead of the bottom.,5
"Luvable Friends Geometric Print Fitted Knit Crib Sheet, Blue",it's soft. it fits my baby's crib without any problem. I can even put 4 thick towels on top on the mattress and still able to fit the sheet.,4
Graco Nasal Clear Nasal Aspirator,"I like this and it does get the boogies out, but I wish the vacuum was a little bit stronger.  The only one we can get anything out with is the smaller, slender tip.  The bigger tip has almost no suction coming through it.  I like this better than the bulb though!  I also love it plays loud music to distract the baby.",4
BABYBJORN Plate and Spoon - Blue,Baby can easily hold and feed herself with these spoons -- they are great. A little pricey but I think worth it.,5
Medela Nursing Stool,"I have to say I am a mother of 3 my youngest is 10 weeks old, I wish I would of had this when I had my other two, and had it for all three of my C-Sections at the hospital. I have been using it now for almost a week, and it definately makes a diffrence. Although when you look at it, it doesnt look like much. Well there isnt much to it but the design is what makes it so wonderful. I am only 5ft 1in in height and I have to say it pretty much accomodates everyone, if you have longer legs you just set the stool further out from what you are sitting on. If you have shorter legs like me you bring it closer to what  you are sitting on. It does make you more comfortable while nursing, after nursing 2 other kids and now nursing my 3rd child I can tell the diffrence. It doesnt really matter how big you are on top either or if they are droopy. Which is something a great deal of women experience when they have breastfed, including me. Sorry about the description of that but just want to give the most accurate comment I can, telling about benefits of using this with normal problems.Overall I would definately recommend it to anyone who breastfeeds. I will definately be using it after I am done even.",5
Fisher-Price: Elmo's Musical Sing and Teach Gym,"First, it's too loud.  It needs to have a volume control adjustment.  And second, when Elmo plays peek-a-boo it makes my son cry because it scares him.  So I don't think this product is for infants.",3
"Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count","I know it says ""colors may vary,"" but pink?!?  If you aren't going to allow a choice, how about at least shipping these with gender-neutral colors?",3
"dexbaby Safe Sleeper Convertible Crib Bed Rail, White","Very pleased with this for converting a crib to a toddler bed. Stays put, no gap, sturdy. Would recommend it.",5
"BreathableBaby Breathable Bumper for Portable and Cradle Cribs, White","I wanted something that would prevent little legs from getting stuck between railings as well as keep extra pacifiers in the crib for the munchkin to find at night.The bumper is light, non-smelly, and most importantly breathable. The mesh allows the air in but keeps little arms and legs inside.I attached it to my DaVinci minirocking crib, wrapping the bumper on the INSIDE of the crib. It fit just fine, in fact, looks like there is enough fabric to try and wrap it outside the crib too. I slid it low, almost to the bottom of the mattress - so far no sagging of the fabric anywhere around the crib.Have not washed it yet, will report back about the bumpers integrity after few washes.",5
Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Wide Neck Newborn Feeding Set,"I don't care if these bottles have 5 total pieces to assemble or not, they are awesome.  My twins would only successfully feed with these bottles and they really cut down on the gas.  My daughter prefers these wide neck ones and my son liked the original sized ones better.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,Just a quick note that my 4 month old (about 24 inches long) loves this even though her feet don't touch the ground yet.  We just put a gift box under her feet and she bounces on that.  This should last her for quite a while as she grows into it.,5
8&quot; Tinkle Crinkle Baby Caterpillar Rattle Toy- Pastel,"I know that this is a baby rattle, but our 9-month-old kitten (&#34;Tigger&#34;) fell in love with an older version of this and nearly tore it apart.  So, when I found this one on Amazon.com, I jumped at ordering two of them.It's not uncommon to see Tigger carrying his caterpillar rattle around the house, stopping and rolling over with it in play mode from time to time.Great product for a great price.",4
Wall-stickers Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Giant Cherry Blossom Tree in Wind,I am pleased with the design I just wish the actual picture was bigger an putting it together doesn't make sense the numbers aligned with the branches don't make any sense compared to the picture they give you as an instruction -- you have to sort of free hand. I had to start it half way up my wall so it made a difference an could actually be seen -- as far as it hold up I put it up about 2 weeks ago an it had not peeled off at all.,3
"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","When you order something online, you never know if it will be beautiful and everything you hoped for, or cheap and flimsy.  When we built this crib for our new baby girl, we were both impressed with how sturdy and well made the crib is.  The wood is thick and nicely sanded.  The parts fit together well without requiring modifications.  The crib has a nice rich wood scent and looks like the ideal mental image I had of the perfect crib.  And since it will convert to a toddler bed and then into a twin bed, there's no wasted crib lying around as unused extra furniture.  We are very satisfied with this crib and would highly recommend it.",5
Piggy Story Suitcase - Cow Print,"Love this suitcase, pillow and blanket.I plan to use the item as a gift for a toddler entering into preschool.",5
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","I would definitely recommend buying this just for piece of mind alone! One thing that I noticed it really helps with though, is keeping arms and legs in the crib as well! Before this arrived and we didn't have a bumper, our baby would wake up during the night because his leg would be stuck in between the rails! Nice color and quality as well. Changing the crib sheet is kind of a pain with it on, but all it takes is a little readjusting to put it all back in place.",5
"Stork Craft Portofino 4-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib and Changer, Espresso",One of the draws is really  scratch would like to get a new one please othere than that is is great,3
Russ Berrie Treetops Giraffe Snuggle Blankie,"My son has had this for over a year and he goes everywhere with us.  He has stood up to being thrown across a room, walked and chewed on.  Washes well although he is starting to show his age as he has been washed many times.  But no holes have appears and there are no real worn spots.",5
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,"I love that this works! Very nice for bath toys to store and that within the tub they can leak out and not make a mess. The the handle, so easy to take off and dump the toys out. Keeps them nice and organized and not all other the tub.",5
"Fisher-Price Playtime Bouncer, Precious Planet",Bought this for my daycare kiddos and it works fabulous! Love how it only makes music when the kids are playing with the animals. Definitely would recommend!,5
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,Nice product.,5
Wiggly Giggler Rattle (Colors May Vary),my 7 month old is obsessed with this toy. she knows how to shake it to make noise and also likes to chew on it. highly recommend!,5
Mommy's Helper Cushie Traveler,"this potty seat worked for a couple weeks. The hinges broke, it split and would no longer sit on the toilet seat.",1
"Kidkusion Clearly Safe Edge Cushion, Clear, 6'",They came off my table in less than a week. It was a waste of money. The glue on the tape just didn't last and it wasn't strong at all.,1
"Philips AVENT 11 Ounce BPA Free Classic Polypropylene Bottle, 1-Pack",I have used Avent bottles for 3 years and have never had an issue. These bottles all leak because there is only a single row of threading on the bottle. All of my other Avent bottles have a double row of threading to prevent leaking. Don't buy these!,1
Manhattan Toy Brilliant Bear Magnetic Stack-up,"We have two other Manhattan toys (winkle toys) which are pretty good quality and have lasted awhile.  This toy also seems of high quality and is easy to play with.  The magnets are strong enough to keep the rings together for stacking, but not too strong that makes it difficult to knock over and have them fall apart, which is what little kids like to do.",5
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","Very roomy.  Used it to carry wet clothes back from the beach.  It fits my swim suit, my husband's swim trunks, and my rashguard with room to spare.  Easy to clean.  Nice zipper.  Well constructed.  Would totally recommend!",5
JJ Cole Essentials Pacifier Pod - Pink Flower,"The pacified pod isn's ""essential"", but it's definitely good to have. You can keep the pacifier clean and easier to find in the diaper bag or in mom's bag, or you can simply hook this on the stroller if you are just going for a walk. And with all the cute patterns, you can definitely find one that suits your taste and matches your stroller or diaper bag!If you like to keep it low-maintenance, this can be particularly useful. If we are out doing errands, often I'll only take a carrier instead of the stroller, and because of the velcro on one end of the pacifier pod ""handle"" I can easily hook into the toy ring of my baby carrier or one of the belt hoops on my jeans. That way when the baby falls asleep and spits out the paci I can pop it in the pod and make sure it stays clean and is easy to find when I need it again. Recommended.",4
"PRIMO Folding Potty with Handles, White granite",I love this potty seat!  It is such a great idea. It folds up pretty small and fits in our diaper bag. If you place a seat cover on the toilet before putting this down you won't have to worry about this seat touching the public toilet!,5
"Bumkins Cloth Diaper Cover, Blue Cat","I have three of this cover and all leak through material. Ok for a couple of hours. Especially bad for night time, completely soaked through cover, baby, clothes and blanket every time.",1
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,"I had to have these.  My daughter-in-law is due to deliver a baby in October.  When I saw the new Prince George wrapped in one, while Prince William was carrying him in his car seat, I bought some!  If they are good enough for the future King of England, they're good enough for my future grandchild!  lol",5
"Chicco Cortina Together Double Stroller, Fuego","Its okay but complicated to use in small spaces but we like it, specially when both kids want to sleep",4
"Baby Boom MVP Nap Mat, Blue",I bought this mat for my 1 yr old..... he looks so cute in it as well as its the pillow and blanket in 1..... I LOVE IT!!!!,5
"Mutsy 4Rider Stroller, Team Lime","I am very pleased with my 4Rider stroller. For me, safety is the most important factor is deciding what baby products to buy so a stroller with a five-point harness is a must. I am so glad I have this now that my baby is more mobile and never stops moving or squirming! I love the versatility of the stroller - I can use it in many different positions, front or rear facing (and it's easy to switch back and forth!), and the recline adjusts to four different positions which is also crucial for me and my baby. My baby is comfy in the stroller and if I need to, I can just pop her car seat in the frame, making it easy to transition from car to the store. It's much easier to maneuver than the other strollers I have tried. I can push it with one hand which is great - moms always need a free hand! Another plus is that the handle is adjustable which makes it great for me since I'm short but my tall (6') husband can also use it. The basket could be a little bigger but this does not take away from the ease of use and functionality of this stroller. Plus it looks great too and comes in a ton of colors! I'd say it's a must have for any new mom.",5
"Luxe Basics Cover Me Glider Chair Cover, Ivory Dot","The glider covers fit really well on the cushions we needed to replace.  They are really soft and cozy as well.  I just feel like for what it is, it is on the expensive side.  That being said, it is still a whole lot cheaper than replacing the cushions through the company or getting the cushions reupholstered ( I looked into those options as well).The color was a little bit different than what I had expected, but it still looks really nice in the nursery.Also, on the arm covers, it is really difficult to be able to use the pockets b/c when you attach them on the chair, they are too high up to access.All of that being said, I am pretty happy with this product, and am still glad I purchased it.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I decided to get this toy for my 9 month old baby after reading so many great reviews.  My son is very active and likes playing with a variety of toys and things.  However, from day 1, my son was just not interested in it.  He will play with it for a few seconds and move on to something more interesting to him.  The toy itself is a great idea and well made but it didn't work for us.",3
The First Years 2 Pack Mickey Newborn Pacifier,It is difficult to find Mickey Mouse in baby items ~ was very happy with these two Mickey Pacifiers.  I would recommend them!,4
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,This looked so nice in the picture but ended up being horrible. There were scratches all over it. There were MANY pieces to put together. The fake wood kept cracking when my husband tried to put it together. We gave up and decided to send it back.,1
"SwaddleDesigns Baby Lovie, Plush Dots Security Blanket with Color Trim, Pastel Blue",I ordered a blanket for my new grandson who is due to be born any day now and this is not a blanket. It is very tiny and is smaller than a burp cloth. Very disappointed customer.,1
"Sesame Street Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 40-Count","My 3-year-old daughter loves using these things...which is good because she never liked using the paper ones restrooms provide. They stick very well (sometimes almost too well - I'll rip the cover off and the adhesive tape will stay stuck on the seat). I like the thickness of them - much more durable than paper covers. As a result, they're not flushable, but the minor inconvenience is worth it. I'm confident my daughter is protected from yucky public bathroom seats.",5
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Toddler",My son loves to chew on this! We had to buy 3 to make sure we always have one around for him :-),5
Holiday Greeting Card Assortment (Set#1) 25 Cards,"Two problems:  #1  the post office sent the cards back requiring additional postage above the Forever stamp because nonmachinable  (the square size).  #2  The cards were not funny but stupid - I could only use a couple of the sayings without looking stupid myself.  The only thing that was good was the paper stock - it was good quality.  But when ordering, I would have liked to be able to read the text before deciding and also an alert that it would require extra postage  $.23 more than the Forever stamp.",1
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I am very happy with our purchase. We have a few weeks before we get someone in there, but we like it so far! It is larger than I was expecting, which is great! It is a bit more wobbly that I expected, which is not so great. The fabric cannot come off of the bassinet to be washed, so I'm a little bit unhappy with that. However, it's SO cute and I just can't wait to use it!",4
Jumpster Doorway Jumper - Jackpot,"Even though I loved this toy as a baby, we too almost returned it because of the not-so-obvious way to shorten the elastic jumper part which is suppose to accomodate taller/shorter babies.  (Our 5-month old baby is taller than most at her age).  So make sure to READ THE DIRECTIONS.Secondly, it is tough getting your child in and out of the seat, but that I feel that is a good/bad feature because at least you know its safe and that your child won't be jumping out of the seat themselves!Our little girl has not hurt herself (yet) by pinching her fingers against the doorway, although we have ours set up in a larger ""through-way"" rather than a regular doorway.I like it better than the stationary ""Jumperoo"" because it gives her more freedom to turn around and see everything, its much more portable and smaller in size (so you can it bring it to Grammys house), and its slightly less expensive. And most importantly, she loves it! So overall I would recommend this toy even with the two drawbacks mentioned.",4
Ingenuity Signature Edition Automatic Bouncer - Shiloh,I couldn't get through a day without it. My goddaughter loves it and when I need it most she is soothed.,5
"Britax Boulevard 70 Convertible Car Seat, Silver Birch","Seems more substantial than other seats on the market. A little difficult to instal but, worth the additional safety benefits. Takes up less room than our old Graco infant seat even when installed rear facing. Like the fabric and pattern even more in person.",5
"DEX Products Womb Sounds Bear, Brown",great little bear...produces the mother's womb sound...it appears to be very soothing to the or for the baby....i worked as a  nurse on pediatrics floor and some of the mothers had this item...so when my niece had her baby i got it for the baby...so far it is doing just great very soothing for the baby especially when  the baby gets a little cranky...i also have my niece play classical music  for and while the baby sleeps  but that is another story...babies do respond to the sound of the mothers womb...i would advise  anyone to get it for a  baby.,5
Baby Bottle Holder - Unique Design Allows Hands Free Feeding (Blue)- By Lil Helper (BPA Free),It's a pretty cool item and helps when you are in the middle of doing things around the house or on the go and the baby needs to feed. Just make a bottle and hook the bottle holder and my baby is comfy drinking milk whether on the bouncer or in the stroller. 4 stars only because it falls over every now and then but that's when the baby is sleepy. Other than that I'm glad to have it.,4
"Playtex TrainingTime Soft Spout Cup, 6 Ounce, 2 Pack, Color May Vary","May 8 month old LOVES to chew on these but the spout isn't really great for her yet. As she gets older, I'm sure these will work jsut fine as they don't leak and seem to be of good quality.The spout is harder than I thought it would be. So far the Munchkin brand is the best for her age.",3
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"This little bath basket works perfectly, looks good, is sturdy, and the price is right!  Love it!  Perfect for baby's toys and body washes.",5
Piyo Piyo Baby's Protective Pillow Blue,"Pillow works great. Size, Cushion and cover soft and plush. If baby is squirmy, head will eventually roll from pillow as with my 2 month old. Would have been better if there was a long fabric attached to pillow so baby can lay on it and weight stabilizes the pillow under head. Could do without the ruffles as it sometimes bothers baby's neck.",3
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","This is the most amazing baby carrier I have ever used. My son outgrew his bjorn at 3 months (it really hurt my shoulders). The ergo is much more comfortable on your back and distributes weight well allowing front, back and hip carrying positions. I have 2 other children and my son spends about 2 hours in my ergo each night while I clean, prepare dinner, help with homework, etc. I could not live without it. The only cons are that it is expensive (but worth the price) and the baby faces you in the front carry position but my son didn't seem to mind.",5
Aqueduck Faucet Handle Extender,"This works just perfectly for what its made for...two handle lever faucets. As long as my 3 yr old has a stool, she's been independent washing her hands.  I still check anyway because when we initially got this, she wouldn't turn off the faucet all the way and we don't want to waste water. But I think that's because I installed it in our faucet with a 4 spoke knob...not a 2 handle one like what it was made for.",4
Spray Pal - Cloth Diaper Sprayer Splatter Shield,"I have had this product for a month or so. I was considering quitting cloth diapering due to the mess of poopy diapers. My husband would get poo on the walls, toilet seat and floor, then forget to clean it up. This simple device has changed that. It is easy to use and keeps everything in. I don't understand how people are having issues with water splashing out. I consider it pretty idiot proof. It is a bit cumbersome to unsnap and then snap back so we leave it snapped together all the time. After each use I wipe it down with Clorox wipes and it fits into my large Kawaii wet bag without folding it down. I have already told all my friends who cloth diaper about it.",5
Pediatrician Designed Infant (Newborn Baby) and Toddler Healthcare and Grooming Kit,"This will work, however I was surprised with the cheap feeling material, and lack of battery in the thermometer. However, the first-aid kit fits easily in a diaper bag, with room to spare for a few additional items. The book that came with it is really good - we were very happy with that.",3
Safety 1st On-the-Go Fold-Up Booster Seat,"We initially bought this booster as a ""travel highchair"" But when I strapped my 7 month old son into this booster he seemed to like it much more then the more expensive(and brand new...sigh)high chair we use at home.The tray is at a better height for him and the chair can be easy pulled right up to the table once the tray is removed if desired.I have found it a breeze to clean and great to travle with since it folds up nicely. It also has a handy little compartment in the back where I like to store his bibs.I have now replaced my regular highchair with this booster....We are much happier with this booster,the big chair is now sitting in the basement all claened up waiting for a gararge sale!!",5

They seem to be good quality and are working fine. The only reason I didn't rate higher is because we haven't had them long enough to know if they will stand the test of time. Otherwise, very satisfied with the product, and you can never have too many cords!",4
"Chicco 360 Hook on High Chair, Midori",This has been my best baby purchase by far.  I SOO wish I had purchased this with my first child rather than waiting until my third to buy it.  We had the big clunky high chairs for my first 2 kids but when we moved to a house with a teeny kitchen/dining space we couldn't find room for it.  We have only 5 chairs to a dining table that can fit 6 so we had to find a solution that wouldn't take up too much space or another chair.  We have 2 other children in booster seats.  I researched several hook on chairs and the problem with them was that NONE of them had trays!!  I found that gross for a 5 month old who was very into self feeding but not quite ready for a plate.  This was a HUGE plus for me and it has been amazing!  the tray is just the right size and super easy to clean!  I am inlove with the fact that it swivels to be able to spoon feed.  I would have liked to see a 5 point harness but this was just fine.  As far as cleaning i haven't had a problem undoing the fabric and tossing it in the wash.  We have the black and yellow one so it hasn't been stained plus if you get some sauce on it you just spray and wash it as soon as they are done and it's fine.  There are some crevices that get food stuck in them on occasion (because the fabric wasn't put back on properly) but i just took the thing to the sink and used the sprayer and everything came out fine.  I was a little nervous spending the money on something like this but I am so glad I did it has been the best purchase I have made.  I just wish I knew about this awesome thing sooner!,5
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"This hadheld monitor has great audio, sound much much better than any other monitor I have purchased. But I don't know how they could call this a color screen monitor. There is vertually no color even during the day. Picture gets scrambled when the phone rings or sometimes it's hard to find a signal. Over all it's nice to be able to see my daughter instead of just hearing her. Save your money and buy one of the black and whites video moitors",3
"HALO SleepSack Applique Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Blue, Medium","My son loves these Halo SleepSacks. He had a few in each size, and he wears one each night. The fleece ones are saved for cold nights. Great product!",5
Lamaze Mittens the Kitten,"Cute kitten with lots of different textures and colors.  The tail is crinkly with the purple part and yellow part of the tail being different textures for an infant's chewing pleasure.  The top of the kitten's back and legs have different colors of a smooth satiny material.  The top part of the paws have knitted yarn feet where the bottom of the paws have different black and white patterns.  The inside of the ears have the same material as on the kitten's back, but the ears are crinkly.  The whiskers are made up of different colored ribbons.  There is a rattle built in that sounds like it is coming from the head and of course the beads around the ring of the front paws make noise.  With all the different textures, colors, and the big round eyes, I'm sure my granddaughter will love this kitten.",5
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I love this warmer.  I didnt get it until 2 months after my son was born.  So the first two months I ran water until it was hot and then waited.  But with this, its wonderful.  Wait time is not long for his bottles.  The chart kind of help with how much water but its a try and error but once you get it down, its pretty consistant.  Sometimes its too hot or still kinda chilled but I run water then, but it is once in a blue moon when that happens.  My son is 7 months now and I used it also to warm up his frozen puree. This takes about three time in the warmer but I rather stem it then use the microwave.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","This gives accurate dimensions, but I didn't think about it before I bought it and it is too small to fit 81/2x11 papers, notebooks in it.  Too small.  But it's cute if you don't need it to hold homework.",4
dreamgenii Pregnancy Body Support and Feeding Pillow (UPDATED),"This product is stated to encourage side-sleeping but does not help at all. I am Asian and of medium build yet still found the pillow tube too thin to elevate my legs and take the pressure off the hips. I had to stack another pillow on top of the Dreamgenii in order to take the pressure off my hips, which defeats the purpose. It would have provided more support if it were stuffed thicker and bigger. The smaller piece does not prevent or even discourage me from rolling onto my back. Given the price (S$120), I could have bought a good quality bolster which would have been more effective. I am now hoping that this pillow will come in useful during breastfeeding otherwise it would have been a complete waste of money.",1
"Hoppop Monty Step Stool, Fuchsia","High quality step stool. My tot often stands right on the edge of this and it is so well built it has not tipped once! The white dots on the top add extra grip so his feet don't slip. The modern design and colors are great! It was a bit pricy compared to other step stools out there, but well worth the price.",5
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"This is one of my favorite purchases.  Some people have complained about its short length but my baby is in the 95th percentile for weight & height at 4 months and she still has room to grow in it.  We no longer need to use it in our bed as she sleeps fine in her crib but we still use it for other purposes around our home & will for travel soon.  After 4 months it still looks brand new & has held up very nicely.  If I could change anything I would make the yellow bar near the feet, which helps keep the baby from sliding down, removable so I could use it even longer!",5
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado",We use these in a standard size garbage can with a flip lid. After a couple days we pull out the bag and all the diapers and it all goes in the washer. Wet hang dry the bag and it had held up really well. I would suggest buying more than one.,5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","My son was pretty well entertained with this until recently. When he was really little he enjoyed just staring at his own reflection in the mirror and cooing, then once he got the hang of using his arms he loved batting at the toys above while kicking the piano, although he didn't seem to realize he was in control of the piano until he was about five months old. For the last couple months he really got into kicking the piano keys and listening to the sounds and as his hand-eye coordination improved he enjoyed reaching for and manipulating all the little dangling things. But now he is too wiggly and active, too good at rolling around, and the mat is just not big enough to contain him. Nor is anything on the toy very interesting anymore. As a six month old is constantly in search of new surprising things, this just doesn't hold his interest any longer. But it was great while it lasted, it barely looks used despite his playing with it nearly every day, and the fabric has survived multiple bombardments of spit-up without a single stain. Overall a very good buy, although I wish I had gotten it at a local store where it cost about half of what I paid here...",4
Carter's Yellow Duck 3-pk. Bib Set YELLOW,These bibs are absolutely adorable and function well.  I really enjoy the design of the bibs and love that they are gender neutral.,5
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","We have owned 3 different Britax products, and this is by far the worst.  Our other products look like they have hardly been used, while this seat shows a lot of wear and tear.  One thing that is very frustrating is that the seat bottom cover will not stay attached to the seat!  There are 2 pieces of elastic on the cover that loop around 2 small hooks on the seat bottom, and the cover will not stay on at all.  The foam on the seat bottom has chunks that have broken off from all the wear of the cover coming off and rubbing against the foam when my son gets in and out of the car.  In addition, we just converted the seat to booster mode and the base of the seat is so wide that it is very difficult to get the seat belt buckled.  My son definitely can't do it, and I even have a hard time getting him buckled.  We will be going back to harness mode.  The contour of the seat itself is awkward, and doesn't seem to fit the car well.  The seat back is too up-and-down, and my son's head will fall forward when sleeping.  Overall, the seat is disappointing.  We've owned it for a year and have been frustrated with it, but the fact the the booster seat mode won't work for us is what prompted me to write a review.",2
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,"The color is beautiful, dark black.  Easy to put together, but the bottom drawer is warped and does not fully push in.",3
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","Like most all the others who have reviewed this seat, I searched extensively on the net and in the stores to find a seat with a five point harness that would hold a slightly larger child.  This is for my 3 year old, who is 41"" tall and weighs about 37 pounds.The seat seems comfortable and sturdy.  It was simple to install and looks pretty good in the car.  My son loves the cupholder (don't they all) and the storage cubby in the arms.  He sleeps well in the car and does seem to have good head support while doing so.  Overall I am very satisfied with the seat and think it will be a good purchase in the long run.  (We have a younger one to pass it to when this one outgrows it)I do have one major problem with the seat, and I have already contacted the Graco company about it, but they say there is really nothing they can do.  Like others have said, the 5 point harness is a little harder to open and close than other seats I have used.  My son can buckle himself in, but he can not get the buckles un-done, so that is a good thing.  He can however put his little thumb in the hole and loosen the straps.  I am not sure if this is a result of him being tall and having longer arms, or if the release hole is just closer to him in this seat.  We went on a 4 hour trip last weekend and we buckled him in and pulled the straps snug, and when we had been on the interstate for about an hour, noticed that he was moving around alot.  We stopped to check it out, and he had loosened the straps, until they were just hanging down around him.  If we had been in an accident, he would have had no protection at all.  Soooo, this is a problem that we will have to address, or get something else.  Hopefully we can convince him not to do such a thing.Again, overall I think this is a wonderful seat and I like the fact that it is made to hold larger older children.  I would recommend it.",4
"Comotomo Baby Bottle, Green/Pink, 5 Ounce, 2-Count","I spent a LOOOONG time researching baby bottles for my little girl. It seemed like the Philips' Avent and Dr Brown's brands were ubiquitous, to the point of taking over all the shelf space in local baby stores. But I just wasn't impressed with any of them. After a bunch of review-diving on Amazon, I settled on these Comotomo bottles instead.Since I haven't tried any of the other brands, I can't say whether these bottles are any better or worse. But I CAN say that these bottles are absolutely fantastic. They're super easy to clean, and my baby girl took to them almost as quickly as she did to the breast. We try to breast-feed her whenever possible, but occasionally we have no choice but to put breast milk in a bottle, and these bottles make me feel just fine about doing so.Our daughter doesn't seem to over-indulge when drinking from these bottles. She drinks fast, but she can stop whenever she needs to and take some breaths. She doesn't seem to ingest any air, and she gets no more or less fussy after eating than she does from breast feeding. There doesn't seem to be any extra effort involved from drinking of these bottles, and the valves work very well to eliminate negative pressure while preventing any leaks.The bottom half of these bottles is very squishy, which is handy for carefully squirting some milk into our daughter's mouth to get her to suck on the nipple. The top half of the bottle is more rigid, which makes it easier to hold the bottle for her without squeezing any extra milk into her.",5
"green sprouts 10 Pack Waterproof Absorbent Terry Bibs , Boys","My baby is 12 months old, still teething and drooling.I needed waterproof bibs that were big enough to use while feeding and comfortable enough to use for the rest of the day (for the drooling). I was a little skeptical when I ordered these because of some of the reviews concerning the size and flimsiness of the product. So I searched some more but came back to this product again because the other bibs for his age were meant for feeding only with a pocket to catch messes, wipe-able, etc.I have just received this box and they are a good size to cover him well. It mentions that its for age 3-12 months i.e. stage 2/3 (just as is mentioned in the item description online). I am glad with the thickness since it looks like it wont bother him to wear all day. Given that there is a waterproof layer inside, I think it should keep him dry too.I also like the variety of colors in this pack and the simplicity of the design. I noticed that they are not the softest bibs ever but pretty good for the price and not too rough for a 1yr old either. I really hope that these do the job of keeping him dry as I expect, will update in case they don't.",4
Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor,I was disappointed with my purchase of this monitor.  No where on the box did it give a range.  On inside paperwork it stated that you will loose quality in sound and/or picture if you go beyond 60ft.  I had to be 66 feet.  I could see the picture pretty well but never could hear any sound - only static.  Keep this in mind if you purchase this product.,3

I bought 4 of the size 1s mostly for my husband, who is not so patient with prefolds.  These seemed like a fairly straight forward, fail-proof option.  Nope.  No matter how we attach them -- high, low, tight, loose -- they leak.  I guess my boy (4 months, 16 pounds) is a big pee-er, but even with a hemp insert, they do not work at all for us.  The search continues...",2
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"Previously we had a summer infant video monitor.  It pooped out, so we chose this one as a replacement.  This is not as nice as Summer Infant.  You can either have video always &#34;ON&#34; or on voice activated operation (VOX) to save power.  I have found that voice activated operation (VOX) is NOT always activated when baby makes noise.  Therefore, I have to keep the monitor &#34;ON&#34; at all times...running out battery quickly.  Sound quality is just OK.  Quality of picture is just OK.  Saw a friend's Motorola monitor which is MUCH clearer, plus has zoom.  So, this is the cheapest video monitor for a reason.  It will likely do the job...just not as clear (video and audio) as higher price options.",3
Mamivac Imported Cherry Shaped Nipple Shield-2 pack (Large Conical),"My son had tongue and lip ties, a high bubble palate, and an awful shallow latch because of it all. The Avent shields I had previously used to continue breastfeeding my daughter were not affecting my son's latch, so I switched to exclusive pumping and bottle feeding, but then decided to try these in hopes that the non-conical shape would make a difference. IT DID. The pain-free nursing experience was night-and-day different from what I had been experiencing with Avent's conical shields. Totally worth the price and the wait!",5
Bamboobies Super-Soft Washable Nursing Pads - All Pale Pink,"Bamboobies are soft, large and  really absorbent for how thin they are. I definitely prefer these over all of the disposable ones as well as the washable Medlela ones.  These wash the better than the Medlela brand. The one advantage the disposables have over this brand is the use of adhesives. It takes some adjusting after nursing and pumping to make sure the bamboobies are placed perfectly.",5

"Large Jungle Animals (Panda, Lion, Elephant, Gorilla) - 3D Wall Murals for Baby Nursery and Kids Rooms - Made in USA",I ordered these for my 7 month old sons play area.  They are very cool.  I love the fact that they can be removed from the wall and moved to a room or house if needed.  I would get these instead of wall decals because they are 1. easier to put up and 2. can be moved without ruining them.  It makes his play area look really cool!,5
"Regalo Hide Away Extra Long Bed Rail, White",This is very sturdy Doesn't work well with a trundle bed. Wish it was easier to move between beds.

Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"GAME CHANGER!!My 7 week old LOVES this! I mean- LOVES it. It provides all the stimulation she needs and keeps her endlessly entertained. Because she's so young we have not used the music or lights yet, but we will transition into those features as she matures. It is unbelievable how much she enjoys all there is to look at. It also buys mom and dad precious time!Quality fabrics, smart patterns/design, effortless to assemble. Other gyms pale in comparison.As you review which gym is right for your baby, note the dimensions. Some are quite small, making its longevity limited. This gym is the perfect size for baby to grow with.",5

This lunch box is great because it is not only cute, but functionable as well.While this isn't a great lunchbox for wide thermoses of soup, it does great for a sandwich, veggies, and drink. I think that it's a perfect size for children or lighter eaters. I usually used it with a small ice-pack, but it is well-insulated and keeps cold food items cold. I have not used it with hot items.I love the bungee pouch, which i use to store my utensils and ice pack.",5

Uses any kind of liquid soap vs buying a certain kind when you buy a certain auto-dispenser. Got many compliments. Turned off the music as it would drive me nuts each time it's used. Suggest this purchase 100%.,5
CoCo &amp; Company Monkey Time Appliqued Sherpa Blanket,"This blanket is everything one looks for in a baby blanket-warm, soft, and cozt. It is a great gift for a new baby and an excited mom.",5
Medela Supplemental Nursing System,"There are very few systems that help you provide supplement at the breast and this is one of them. While I think it's a bit overpriced, it does as advertised and is better than Medela's starter SNS because it can hold more milk and has the option of changing the tubing to different sizes to decrease or increase flow rate. It is also easier to clean.The SNS allows you to breastfeed and add in supplement at the same time by taping a tube to each breast and having your baby latch onto you and the tube. The problem is that you have to get the latch just right and it's really hard to do this if you and your baby doesn't have the latch down because the tube has to be positioned correctly for it to work. Getting a good latch is key, otherwise you'll be in pain and both you and baby will be frustrated with the device. The instructions aren't very good but, for me, it worked to have the end of the tube meet with the end of my nipple and to have it positioned so that the tube is at the front portion of the baby's mouth. It doesn't have to be centered up at the roof of the mouth but it is more likely to work that way. I find having the tube sticking out past the nipple makes it less likely you will get the baby to latch on correctly because the tube does move around a lot. The tape that comes with the kit (there are two rolls of it) is surgical paper tape that you can pretty much find at any drug store so you don't need to get more from Medela.The device is great for:-increasing breastmilk supply through stimulation if the baby refuses the breast because there is little to no milk, or lack of flow-Finger feeding instead of bottlefeeding to avoid nipple confusion (tape the tube, one or more, to a finger pad, insert into mouth padside up-allowing a mother who has adopted a child to feed at the breast, even if she has no milk.If you're at all curious about the features of the device. Google the instructions for this on the Medela website and you'll be able to read more on it and it's uses.",4

Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,I decided to break down and buy a warmer for my third child after watching him react every time we did a diaper change. This is a nice warmer with a light in the front for nighttime low light. It sits on my bedside table and is always at the ready for a diaper change. You have to keep an eye on the wetting pillow at the bottom of the interior. I've dried it out completely more than once and stick it in some warm water and it comes back fine. Not sure what ill do with it once my baby outgrows it but its a nice option for someone with a small child.,4

"Arm's Reach Concepts Mini Arc Convertible Co-Sleeper Bassinet, Natural","The concept of this is great -- loved having a bedside bassinet, hated that this one's take-down was a nightmare.  No.  Just no.  My husband and I -- who are not idiots -- tried to collapse this to take with us on a trip and couldn't do it... we ended up taking our large pack and play with us (made midnight nursing sessions very difficult with a newborn).  We finally had to take it down to store it... we honestly thought we would be forced to store it in its un-collapsed state, it was so difficult.  The instructions skip steps, the buttons and such stick and/or aren't in their marked places, and it's ridiculously heavy for its size once it is collapsed (if you are lucky enough to successfully collapse it).  We store all of our baby items for our next baby but NOT THIS ONE.  I don't even know if I would feel okay selling this to someone.  We will be paying for a different brand of bassinet for the next baby.  Do not touch this thing with a 39.5 pole, unless you enjoy getting so angry that you curse like a sailor and break everything in sight.",1

"Munchkin Snack Catcher, 9 Ounce, 12+ Months, color may vary","Maybe our daughter is too young to use this product as intended.  As soon as we gave it to her, she understood how to reach in to retrieve a snack, but she quickly learned to completely remove the top.  Ultimately, fun won out over hunger and she either held down one of the flaps and then shook the container; thereby releasing all contents onto the floor and her lap; OR she just removed the top and dumped the contents onto the floor and her lap.  We gave it to our neighbors and their 15-month old is able to use the snack catcher just fine.  It's possible that our daughter will grow into being able to use this, but I'm not entirely convinced.  Why is it so easy to pull the top off?  A screw top instead of a pull on/off lid would be more appropriate, I think.",1

I do wish there were a cover just for where you put your head that could be easily washable without taking the whole entire cover off. I have been putting a crib sheet over the curved part to sleep on and washing just that and it works out pretty good. This pillow is very large, I am only 5'4"" and it seems a little long but it still works good. I would purchase this again.",5

He is still rear facing and would get frustrated in his other carseat because the car seat was so low and the windows in our SUV were too high for him to really see anything. I also think that strap adjuster button in the front is awesome! Would highly recommend this seat!,5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units,This product is great. We love it. It makes it so easy to hear without the white noise that the older monitors had. It is an added plus that you can talk to whoever is in the room being monitored.,5
Cosco Portable Crib - White,"These are great, sturdy cribs.  This is the only crib we use in our Church nursery.  The metal is easy to keep clean and sanitary, and does not get worn out over time like wood cribs.  Three of these cribs fit in the space of two full size cribs, too, which is great when space is at a premium.",5
Bell Classic Child Carrier,"After having two kids and trying to get active again my husband and I came across this. We installed one on my husbands bike and another on mine. From the very first time we set the kids in there and took them for a ride it was great. they both ended up falling asleep while my husband and I got a bit of excercise and relaxation. However, my 3 year old is on the taller side and she could hit the tires with her feet. So, we had to stop using it. But, it was good while it lasted.",4
"Starting Small Novelty Hamper, Floral",i loved it the first three months but after that the four small pipes used to hold open the basket started to fall out and have torn holes though the mesh. It isnt very good for long term usage.,2
Milkscreen: Home Test to Detect Alcohol in Breast Milk 8 Pack,"It works ok, but the color change is very subtle so you have to look really closely at it. It's good to have on hand though to ease your mind.",3
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I really love this thing. It expands, is easy to clean, easy to hold everything, easy to take out and doesn't hold water. Great investment for the lifetime of a little person's childhood.",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units,"So far, we are very pleased with these monitors. They have good clear sound and pick up even the quieter noises our baby makes. They do not pick up interference from our cordless phone or our neighbors. Glad we have two monitors for different floors and the Wilkie talkie feature is particularly handy as we try to communicate throughout the house. My only complaint is the poor battery life on the parental units; I wish they kept enough power to last through the night and charged more quickly in the morning.",4
"Naturepedic Organic Cotton Pillow with Organic Cotton Filling plus Kapok (Silk Cotton) Filling, Standard","I ordered 2 pillows, one for myself and one for my child, and have been very happy with them.  I had a very firm pillow previously, so unlike other reviewers, I've found this pillow to be on the medium to soft side for firmness.  I usually have trouble falling asleep, but I've slept much better since the first night with this pillow.Regarding the odor (it's not a bad smell at all) but I found that I put a pillow case on my child's pillow right away which caused the smell to linger for a week or two.  So when I got my pillow I left it out without anything covering it for a day and the smell dissipated quickly.",5
"Barin Toys Cotton Breastfeeding Necklace, White","Consists of a wooden ring around which some thin cotton threads have been sewn.  During teething the cotton threads are easily pushed to the side exposing the wooden ring which is what the child actually would be chewing on.  Was advertised as organic cotton but the item came without any evidence attesting to this claim.  The item was shipped from what appears to be the private home of an individual in Riga, Latvia.",1
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"I really like these trays. They are perfect for storing home made food in the freezer. You can use a normal ice cube tray, but these have a lid, so the can easily stack, not spill, and protect a little from frost bite. Now if only they were cheaper. lol. But they are not too bad, so no complaints.",5
Happy Stroller's Swiss Strolli Rider by Bibi of Switzerland,"I purchased this after trying 2 different buddy board-style riders. They were so awkward, our ankles took a beating and the children still had to stand when little legs were tired. This is so much easier to use and fun! We get comments wherever we go. The two older boys (grandsons) take turns on the StrolliRider that we have fondly nic-named 'The Hitchhiker' while the baby rides happily. They all love it and it sure saves everyone's back from aching! It trails along with no trouble, taking corners smoothly and leaving our ankles alone. I just can't recommend this highly enough. You will love it hands down, and your children will too. In fact, I'm thinking about getting another one for the other side of the stroller since 2 new (grand)babies will soon be joining our family.",5
Jeep Travel System Weather Shield,"If you like to walk around town not matter the weather with your child this is a must. It will protect your child from rain, snow and windy conditions.",5
Safety 1st ProGrade 2 Latches No Drill Magnetic Cabinet and Drawer Latches,"I use these types of locks to keep knives and silverware, and other dangerous kitchen utensils and tools out of the hands of my special needs son.  I had previously use the Tot Locks, which work great, but due to the difficulty in installing them decided to give these a try.  And they work like a charm :)  My son is very mechanically inclined, unfortunately, and if he could see the lock he would be able to figure it out in no time flat.  But because of these are designed the cabinet or drawer only opens about 1/2"" and there's nothing for him to push on to open it.And installation was very simple.  I loved that I did not have to drill the holes for the releases.",5
"Dappi Waterproof 100% Nylon Diaper Pants, 2 Pack, White, Small","They do the job as intended. And like others have stated the sizes run a little bit off. So adjust the size you are ordering. But for what they are they'll do. They aren't going to stop the hoover dam from breaking, or a New Guinea... Mud slide, So if you're expecting a miracle, look elsewhere. But for the basic intended purpose (again) it does fine.",5
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot","Seems like I looked forever for a pacifier clip that would work with a Soothie paci.  This works great and my son can't pull it off his shirt like the others.  My reason for not giving this 5 stars is because the metal clip started rusting very quickly.  We've only had it a few months, and it doesn't stay wet a lot either.  He does drool a bit and I wash it regularly -but we only use it when we are out and about so it hasn't had THAT much use.  Still, a very neat and useful product!",4
"Philips AVENT 8 Ounce Natural Glass Bottles, 2-Pack",glass seems to be cleaner,5
"Kushies Flushable Biodegradable Diaper Liners, 100 Sheets",These are much thicker than other ones I have bought.  They actually catch the poop in stead of letting it leak through to the diaper!  (I use this with my 3 month old)  Definitely keep buying these!!,5
"Gerber Waterproof Pant, 2 Pack, White, 12 Months",I would recommend this product for any new mother who is  using cloth diapers it is a must thank you very much,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Assembly went smoothly (15-20 mins), but you need a screwdriver in order to do the job.The rocker is so nicely balanced that even the slightest movement of the baby (currently 2 1/2 months old) will cause the chair to rock, so it acts like a self-soothing mechanism: baby gets agitated, chair starts rocking, baby calms down.The vibration unit is very power efficient. 1 D size battery lasted for a month of daily use, before we had to change it.The static position of the chair is convenient for feeding or longer naps.The whole thing is very lightweight, so you can easily move it around the house.Toy bar looks nice, but our baby is not into toys yet.",5
GEENNY Musical Mobile For Boutique Animal Kingtom 13 PCS Crib Bedding Set,"they are excellent, the customer services are very good, I do the returns because de color is not there I need. But everything it's ok.",5
Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Bottle Newborn Feeding Set,"I a highly please with these bottles. I noticed less spit up, less crying, and less gas with these bottles compared to just a bottle/nipple combo. They're a pain to clean because of all the parts, but I quickly got used to it and now it's just routine. Only bottles I use!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I agree these bottle leak terribly, from the beginning. My husband figured out the simple engineering flaw, and its kindof appalling they don't fix them. I guess they think mothers like to be messy.",1

"Mumi&amp;Bubi Solids Starter Kit, 42 x 1oz Cubes In Two Compact Baby Food Freezer Storage Trays, Plus Free e-Recipes","These trays are great if you make your own baby food. I haven't had any problems getting the cubes out, just push on the edge of it and it slides right out. The top stays put, they stack nicely. Overall very happy with these.",5
"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear","My wife and I really like these. They are super useful, the lids snap on easily, they freeze well, and they're easy to clean. I do wish we had got larger ones as our 10 month old usually eats a little more than 2 oz now. We have moved on to 4 oz rubbermaid food storage containers for baby food now. These were good though. (except kind of expensive)",4
"Pura Kiki Stainless Infant Bottle Stainless Steel with Natural Vent Nipple, 11 Ounce, Aqua Blue, 3 Months+","I'm not a fan plastic, even bpa free. So I have purchased mainly glass and steel bottles. However with a little boy whose favourite activity is throwing things with the force of a major league pitcher glass is not often a friend. The Pura bottles now have a few small dings and dents, but overall have held up very well. I went ahead and ordered the sippy nips which come in a two pack. It made for a very easy transition from bottle to sippy cups as my son was able to continue to use the same cups as he always had. I fiddled with the new top for about 10 minutes and then forgot about it.",5
"5 Piece Dark Gray Suit with Shirt, Vest, and Tie - Size 10",Loved this suit...I don't know what people expect for $45.00...but I'm extremly happy. My son wears this suit regularly along with other sold from pinkprincess...the quality is worth the purchase...exceeds my expectations...Thank you Amazon,5
Smart Mom Teething Bling Donut Shaped Necklace - Turquoise,My 6 year old son started putting things in his mouth to chew when his molars were coming in. His teacher suggested this product and it has helped him to avoid mindlessly chewing on choking hazards like erasers. He keeps it in his pocket.,5
MAYA WRAP Lightly Padded Baby Ring Sling Carrier (MEDIUM - BRIGHT STRIPE),"I purchased the Maya Wrap and a Moby Wrap under the recommendation of different seasoned moms. I have to say that I much prefer the Maya wrap. It is stylish and extremely easy to wear. Our baby rested well in both, but with the Moby, you have to put it on before you leave the house. You can't just decide to put it on because it is extremely long and difficult to wrap in public. In fact, you can't do it without having some of the fabric hang on the floor (which isn't really sanitary to me). Not so with the Maya wrap. You can pack it in your diaper bag and pull it out if you want to walk around carrying your baby. It is easy to take on and pull off. It is also easy to get baby out of in a hurry if s/he is fussy. Our baby is less than 3 weeks old, so I have only experimented with the newborn hold, but I am sure that this product will last in the months to come! I'm very excited to have it.My only criticism is the sizing. I ordered a large because the website said that the longer tail would be better for nursing moms, and the tail comes past my knees. If I put anything in the pocket, it clanks around and hits my shin/knee, which is annoying. I wish I had bought the medium, but I'm having a tailor shorten the wrap I have.All in all, this is an excellent product.",5
Ameda Flexshield Aereola Stimulator,"I always have trouble pumping and I am small breasted. So, I thought the flexishields could help. But they make me hurt more, and even itch. I used them a few times hoping my body will learn to respond to them. But my pumping sessions were much worse with them. So now, they are just collecting dusts..",1
Sealy Baby Posturepedic Crib Mattress - Mini Fleur,"This mattress fit the crib perfectly, leaving no gaps at all in my Storkcraft standard crib. It is nice and firm, as a crib mattress is supposed to be. I researched just about every crib mattress out there, and feel that this was the best mattress for the best price (I think I paid only $[...] with free shipping.) Very nice, high-quality mattress.",5
Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobile,My daughter has loved this mobile since day one and continues to this day to listen to it every night and uses it to soothe herself.,5
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom",Purchased this as a replacement for my AngleCare monitor that I original purchased in June.  The Motorola monitor is significantly better than the AngleCare monitor.  I would recommend this for any new parent.,5
"KF Baby Clip-On Mini Stroller Fan, Green","It clips on nicely to the stroller. My son does grab at the blades, but since they're made of foam, it doesn't hurt him.cute and blows decent amount of air onto baby.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Possibly my kids' most favorite gift we've ever gotten them thus far (and our kids have quite the variety of toys). We bought this for our boys for Christmas and they LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!! My youngest (who is 2 yrs old) won't go to sleep or even take a nap without his turtle on. I was sure they'd like it when we ordered it for them, but I had no idea what a hit it'd be. Yeah, the gold light is hard to see but it's no big issue...and not a deal breaker by any means. Great for kids of all ages - heck, even fun for adults. I wish I'd had one when I was a kid!",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,This works great for all my son's stuffed animals but I just need a bigger corner to hang it in so I can take advantage of all the space it could save!,4
"Stork Craft Milan 2-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib and Changer, Espresso","I really love the final product! However, there were a few problems putting it together. My husband and I were able to figure out assembling the crib with poorly written directions. I am annoyed that the crib must be attached to the changer even though it can be disconnected for a toddler bed. Some of the pieces were missing the pre drilled holes but I just banged a nail in the top to get it started.If you have patience and are pretty handy, this is the crib for you!",4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,We started using this sponge for our newborn when she still had her umbilical chord attached and could not be fully submerged in water.  Now we use a tub w/ infant sling for our 2 month old to bathe but the sponge is great for having a soft place to dry her off.  We also use it anywhere we need a soft surface to lay her.  We recently took her hand and footprints for her baby book and we used the sponge to lay her on b/c we did not care if we got paint on it.,5
"Prince Lionheart Corner Guards, Chocolate Brown","Here's the deal: when you order a product like this, you expect it to be hassle-free. Well, well, well, not so much here. The company decided the use the flimsiest tape available on the market for the corners&#8212;and guess what: it doesn't stick to your wood table. It doesn't work.Thanks god we had extra strength 3M tape in our cabinet.If you have an extra reserve of sturdy double tape, go for it. If not, make sure you understand you'll have to buy some in addition to what's offered here.",1
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"We have had ours for several months now (bought when she was 3 mths, she is now 7 mths.). Our baby still plays with them even though I don't put the rattles on her anymore. She loved kicking off the socks. Which was fun to watch. It's all great exercise for baby. I have even used one of the wrist rattles in her car seat. I attached it to the strap so that she had something to play with because she isn't able to really keep a good grip on toys, yet. The socks are really great for her because they have more material for her little hands to grip. ***Here are the toys measurements (taken with seamstress tape): Wrist Rattles: 5 and 5/8 inches, Sock Rattles: 6 inches.*** These toys have machine washed well in a delicate cycle and air dry. These rattles are adorable and definitely worth buying. They would make a great baby shower/welcome baby gift.",5
"Starting Small Super Storage Hammock, Light Blue/White",I have never been one for squared off looks forany room so this sweet little hammock suspendedin the air gives a fun look to the room and withthe stuffed toys positioned just right (if we havetime) brings a lively atmosphere as opposed tobeing crammed on shelves as nothing more thandust collectors.,5
Carter's Jungle Jill Musical Mobile,"This mobile looks cute with the Jungle Jill themed bedding and wall decorations, but it really is just for looks.  There was a flaw in the hook that holds the mobile to the arm.  it was too big to fit through the little loop, and we had to jury rig it to get it to hang correctly.  This is definitely not worth the money.",2
1D 62 x 90 inch Blanket,Great service! Arrived quickly. Ny daughter loves the blanket and uses it all day. Very soft and larger then most rhrows. Highly recamend  i you have a One Direction fan in your house.,5
"Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP 30-30 Extra Base, Charcoal",I bought this to put into my other car.  I am glad i bought it but I am really unhappy about the price.,3
Bumkins Waterproof Art Smock - Dr. Seuss Cat In The Hat,We love the bumpkins bibs and I was actually using an old one as an art smock. I was happy to find the same one in a larger size.,5
Tickle Toes - My First Birthday Pink Bib,This is just the cutest bib for your daughter or granddaugher's first birthday.  The work on it is beautiful and it makes a wonderful keepsake.  The seller was wonderful to work with as well.,5
"Re-Play Spill Proof Cups, Purple, 2 Count","I like these cups, despite minor leaking issues. I ordered this 2 pack and a 2 pack of aqua. Of the four cups, one was missing a valve, but it wasn't worth it to me to contact anyone. It was likely a rare mistake.",4
"Halo Sleepsack Velboa Deluxe Wearable Blanket, Pink Flower, Small","No matter how many times we washed and scrubbed the flowers, they still retain an awful stench or my daughter's solid food spit up it would be gone for a day when cleaned but come right back in the same spot every time",3
Saria bidet spray converts toilet into a bidet [Misc.],Thanks for a good product! We are using ours as a cloth diaper sprayer and it's working wonderfully! The only complaint is that the head is a little leaky after you use it.,4
Baby Chef Ultimate Baby Food Maker,"I usually read many product reviews before deciding which brand of a particular item to buy. In the case of a baby food maker, I found that most of them had many positive and many negative reviews, making it difficult to base my decision on previous reviews. I finally just purchased the one I thought I would like best, which was this one. I have not been disappointed! Although the water cup is a bit too small and there are times I wish the steamer and processor were both a bit bigger as well, everything has worked great! Overall, I have really been enjoying making my daughter's food and it's quick and easy! I like that you can just add the water and food, start the steamer and walk away. When processing, it takes a bit of practice to know how much water to add, depending on what you're making. The processor blade seems to be pretty sharp and works well. I do, however, wish that all of the pieces were dishwasher safe. I love knowing that the food I'm feeding my child is all-natural and this product is making it fun and easy to make her food myself!",4
"Orbelle 3-6T Toddler Bed, Natural","This Orbelle Toddler Bed is wonderful!! I order this bed one month ago for my 21 month boy. This bed is very easy to put together. Took maybe 20 mins.... Very sturdy, elegant looking bed. The side rails is just perfect. My little boy sleeps very wild, and the rails block him from falling off the floor! With the supersaving shipping option! You CANNOT BEAT THIS DEAL!!!!!! I'm so glad I ordered this bed!",5
Ikea PATRULL Non-Slip Bath Mat - Green Crocodile,,2
"JJ Cole Arctic Bundleme, Cocoa/Lagoon, Infant","I purchased the JJ Cole Bundleme when my son was first born and absolutely loved it, but after a year, he outgrew it.  I decided to stick with JJ Cole and purchased the Arctic Bundleme. I love it! It is so easy to put over the stroller and very warm. My son sits in it comfortably every time he is in his stroller. It is so much easier than carrying a blanket everywhere and having it drag on the floor. The sides zip down, so if your child gets too warm, you can unzip it and place their legs on top (which I have done several times). This is a very nice product and I would buy it again.",5
"Carters Velour Playard Fitted Sheet, Ecru","It is a little snug on the Dream on Me 3&#34; Foam Mattress, but it does fit. You just have to work with it a bit. I washed it and air dried. Very soft and just as described.",5
"Dapper Snapper Baby &amp; Toddler Adjustable Belt- Boy's Colors: Navy, Beige and Black","This is not a belt.  It only goes in the back three belt loops.  Babybeltz carries actual belts for babies, toddlers, etc which are much better.",2
"Munchkin Baby Food Grinder, Light Blue",This is a must have when raising a baby. It is inexpensive and very practical and functional. Simplify life and get one. It is dishwasher safe as well.,5
"Baby Trend Expedition Double Jogging Stroller, Skylar","DO NOT BUY !! I purchased this expedition stroller when my oldest was 2.5 and youngest 8 weeks. I researched all the double strollers and in spite of the complaints about the wobbly wheel I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. In the 18 months I have had the stroller I  have had to replace the front wheel twice,the inner tubes twice on EACH of the back tires and now the front wheel shifts to the left when you are walking. Even worse when in locked position. My husband has adjusted the front wheel many different times trying to stop the wobbly wheel. It would work for a couple days then start again. We have tried all the tips that customers have recommended. What is even worse is that the front wheel came right off while walking in the mall.  Thank God the baby was not hurt. Don't waste your money. I wish I had spent the $200 on a brand that would stand behind their product. tlsjv@sbcglobal.net",2
Jill McDonald Lullabye Breeze Nursery Lamp,"This is a cute lamp, and obviously lights up the room as intended.  But, I cannot get the lamp shade to stay on securely!  Not worth returning since it matches the nursery so well, but I have to be sure not to bump it or the shade shifts and looks crooked.",3
Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"Whenever a product turns out to be a piece of crap i go out of my way to tell the world.  Our Junkaroo is only about two years old and is falling apart.  And it's not from overuse or misuse.  The legs fold for storage/transportation.  They are supposed to be held in the open position when in use by little metal nipples that fit into plastic dentents.  Yeah...plastic....that's gonna last.  As one might expect, the nipple/detent system ultimately has failed and the legs won't stay in the open position.  The whole thing  is wobbly, dangerous and is basically going to wind up being more plastic junk clogging up our landfill.",2
Bedtime Originals Super Sports Sheet - Blue,these sheets were really cute for a little boy with a sports fanatic for a dad. they seem to wash nice and are holding up,5
"Cardinal Gates Auto-Lock Gate, Black","Looks very nice. Easy to install and adjustable width makes it fit the space well. Easy to operate as well, can open and close easily with one hand.",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","Again, another good idea for babies/mothers however, the size of the bra is just so hard to fit for every specific body type.  If you get a good fit on this, it might be a good product.  The price of the item is also outrageous.  I've seen similar DIY models online which probably are just as good for a fraction of the price.",1
Nuk Hello Kitty Orthodontic Silicone Pacifiers-6-18M,Purchased for baby shower.  I was under the impression that pacifiers were all one size.  I have been schooled.  The little one is just now turning 6-mo. old.  Something new every day.,4
"green sprouts 10 Pack Waterproof Absorbent Terry Bibs , Boys",Bought these to help keep my little guy's shirt dry and keep from changing bibs so often....THEY WORK! I really like that they don't have the vinyl back like others bibs that would rub against his neck. Even better that they are solid colors so I can pair with any outfit. He is able to keep one on all day without a wet shirt! Be sure to follow washing instructions.,5

"Gerber First Essentials 2 Pack Soft Center Latex Pacifier, Colors May Vary",I had problems with my baby not taking a pacifier. I tried to give him every single kind & he hated them all until I came across these. He took them right away & after taking these for about 2 months he know takes other pacifiers but these are definitely his favorite.,4
Baby Einstein Bendy Ball,"I received this toy and gave it to my 6 month old. He shook it a few times, tried to chew on it then threw it at his brother. He has zero interest in it. He is now 9 months old and still wont play with it. I think a regular ball would have kept him entertained longer.",3
The First Years Everywhere Gate,We have this at the top of our stairs.  It's been easy to install and use.  The baby/toddler has never tried to climb it and is still (at 2 years old) completely unable to open it by himself.,5
"ERGObaby Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Natural","The Heart2Heart Insert is so easy to use. I just lay it down on the changing table, set the little guy in it, fasten the strap across the front, and then pop the whole thing into the ERGO. When we first started using it, he would fall asleep almost immediately because he just loved being all snuggled up against his daddy or I. The back of the insert gives great head support. I used this in the ERGO for everything from long walks in the woods by our house, to just walking around the kitchen making dinner!",5
"JJ Cole Arctic Bundleme, Cocoa/Lagoon, Infant","We're using it on the Baby Jogger Summit X3, which we love! Seems to keep our tot nice and warm, and is plenty big enough (some seem to be too small for an 18 month old, but this will fit into next winter too I think&#8230;)",4
Skip Hop Swipe Baby Wipes Case,"This case is very bulky. Seems to be durable material, and I like that it has a strap, something I have not seen in other cases. However, the red dot that slides for ""easy"" access is not so easy. I'd call it sticky access.Other than the hanging strap, there is NO reason to buy this. I recently found a slimmer design at BabiesRUS that is made by Huggies and has a flap in the center to access wipes. This Skip Hop case opens to one side and is hard to grab the wipes out.I would like to edit my review to be only one star. After one week inside the case, my wipes were dried out. This is not acceptable.",3
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,I purchased this as a shower gift.  It will be nice for when the baby is bigger and teething.  It crinkles and is soft at the same time.,4
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock",I was debating and debating for MONTHS on which car seat to choose...the britax or the graco 3 in 1 natalius.  I narrowed these 2 seats because they both get awesome reviews for safety.  We have britax (roundabout and marathon) so I was already familiar with this great product.  I love the frontier and I am so glad that I made this choice! I know that britax is #1 in safety and they are well built...that was not my concern.  My main concern was comfort.  I wanted to be able to go on car rides (long trips) and rest easily knowing that my boys would nap great in the car...without their heads slumping forward!  Nothing drives me crazy like that does......they do not nap well and I can not concentrate knowing their poor little necks are being tossed all over the place.  We have been in town and they have fallen asleep with no head slump at all.  I am very happy with this pruchase.,5
"Stork Craft Beatrice 3 Drawer Chest, White","When assembling this product, I ran into 3 problems.1st-the draw rails, that were previously attached to the side panels were not flush.  With this being said, the drawers would not go in the dresser completely.  I was able to get a drawer completely in, but when I went to pull the drawer out, it was completely stuck.  I had to take the drawer rail (with the rollers) off, in order to get the drawer out.2nd-knobs do not get tight when assembled, so they will constantly spin.3rd-when pulling the knobs to slide the drawer out, the knobs come off their screws.For the price, you would think it would be higher quality.  Find something else to buy.  Don't waste your time.  I am returning mine.",2
"Safety 1st Go Hybrid Convertible Booster, Waterloo",I love the ease of use of this product. I love the fact that is it 5 point harness and converts to a booster seat.,5
"Munchkin Sesame Street Toddler Fork and Spoon, Elmo","I purchased this Elmo fork and spoon set to match an Elmo plate set I purchased for my niece for when she visits with me. I am so happy with the set. It's a nice sturdy set. Elmo is a nice thick plastic and not too bulky, the perfect size for little hands. This set is excellent for children who are just learning to use utensils and will still be used as they grow unlike some toddler sets.I've had the set for 2 years now and it is used almost daily. I haven't noticed any discoloration or change in the the utensils, they still look the way they did when purchased. I'm very pleased with my purchase.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"Don't even bother with this product.  It requires you to buy special bags, it is cheaply constructed, it is virtually impossible to operate while keeping one hand on a squirming baby on the changing table, and the bags make a loud rustling sound when disposing a diaper.  (That may not sound like a bad thing, but it is when it wakes a sleeping baby at 4AM!)  Check out the Diaper Champ.  MUCH more user friendly!",1
Mommy's Helper Toilet Seat Lid-Lok,This isn't a high-end product. It a cheap white piece of plastic. But it does the job... keeps the lid down so my toddler cannot raise it. My only real negative besides it being a cheap piece of white plastic is that it's a bit unintuitive to others how to open it at first.

"Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 3 (Light Blue, Bright Blue, White)","I love this product! When I decided to do cloth diapering I was hesitant because of the pins. I have never used pins before but when a friend showed these to me, I was sold!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,we got a lot of use out of it. This was a life saver on our international flight when our daughter was teething. Color has faded over time(have been using for over 4 months now) and it does not really look like new anymore.,4
"Tommee Tippee Sensitive Tummy Bottle, 9 Ounce, 2 Count",These are the best bottles I have tried for my son that has had an upset stomach and gas since he was born. They have really helped with his fussiness and gas. Best bottles I've tried and I've tried at least five different ones. He loves that the nipples are more shaped like a natural nipple too.,5
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",Some of the buttons stick. It has a nice variety of sounds an music. The projector head is adjust able so you can put the image where ever you want it,4
BUILT NY Munchler Lunch Bag - Meadow,"I have read the reviews about the size of this rabbit lunchbox and I think I may be able to clear things up a bit.  Let me start by saying that we have had this lunchbox for a year and are VERY happy with it! My daughter loves all things bunny and was over the moon to get this for preschool. We have found it very durable and I like that it is easy to unfold and clean. The fact that it unfolds to a lunch mat is nice, too.  Ok, about the size... It is definately too small for a lunch but works perfect for a snack! I think why so many people disagree about it isn't so much the size as it is the shape. The bunny head shape is very difficult to fit too much in. My child is not a big eater and I don't think I would be able to fit enough in it (with an ice pack and water bottle or thermos) for even her small appetite. I did give it 5 stars because it is adorable and (for snacks) it is perfect!",5
Bright Starts Cute Critters Activity Jumper,"I fell in love with this product as soon as I saw it (and that's saying something....I am highly critical of buying these kind of things brand new,since babies don't use them for long). I like all the toys that came with it AND I absolutely love the fact you can add your own toys (which you CAN'T do on the more expensive competitors). Something else that sold me was the fact that this model is slightly more compact than it's competitors, which makes it PERFECT for apartment living where space is at a premium. Finally, the fact that is sells for roughly $15-20 cheaper than it's competitors, makes this a real steal.My son has also thoroughly enjoys it too. He bangs on the keyboard and laughs. He likes it when I add the extra toys and enjoys the toys that came with it too.",5
"MAM Perfect Silicone Pacifier, Purple, 6 Plus Months, Design may vary",The product was not supposed to delivered until June 12- June 27 and I received the product on June 2.  I was very happy with the product and would purchase more items from this buyer!!!,5
Sprout Shell FL09007 Carnival Bloom,"I bought this cover initially because where we live we have horrible wind in the springtime (if not the majority of the year) and keeping blankets over my daughter proved to be impossible. We have now been using this cover for about 6 months and it is awesome! My daughter loves to see the pattern from the inside and it is nice to be able to still use the handle and also see her from the hole in the top. I've washed this several times and the color and quality remain the same. If I had to point out one flaw, I would say that there is just a tiny gap on both sides on my particular carrier, where the cover doesn't completely cover. But, I don't think much gets in and out of there anyway. I would definitely recommend this for anyone with windy weather. It isn't heavy duty so I don't know how much it would help with extremely cold weather but as far as a sun shade and a wind shade this cannot be beat.",5
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","I bought this to keep a medium sized dog in a room without having to shut the door. It's strong enough to hold his 60 pounds when he stands on it to see what's going on in the other room, and the gravity powered auto-shutting gate works flawlessly. The only issue that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it's secured to the wall with adjustable legs (padded, so they do not leave a mark on the wall), but because of the gate opening, the legs can't be adjusted tight enough to make the gate 100% unmoveable. It's almost 100% secure, but tightening the legs too much prevents the gate from shutting. I would not use it for a child near stairs, but as I said, it holds up under the weight of a 60 pound dog so it works for me.",4
Uniqstore Pretty Argyle Pattern Woman Bag Handbag 170383 (Red),"After I used it a few days, the glue on the handle came off.  The thread on the side of the purse is coming off.  It looks good but bad quality.",2
Jumbo Toy Hammock,"Once the pet net is acutually on the wall it's fine, but getting it there is another story...There is no hooks to determine the placement or distance which made it difficult to hang.  Now that it's up it's great!!  I just don't want to think about moving again and having to fight with it once more!!!",3
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,I bought 2 more of this item after I bought 3 in the past as I wanted all my friends with small children to have one as it is wonderfull but this time I received a good one and a defective one...not even if I change the battery it works....!!! It is not worth for me to go at the post office and send it back and wait and pay! too much hassle ..,1
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","We have several Planet Wise diaper bags, and the quality has been great so far.  We've had them for about 2 months, and washed them repeatedly (I usually - but not always - line dry them because I figure they will last longer).  I ordered the small bag for normal daily outings, but I can usually only fit two cloth diapers in it, and that is if I roll them up really tight and squish them in.  The small size would be better for cosmetics or toiletries maybe, but not swim suits or cloth diapers.  It's just too small.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This product saved me. I have a 2 year-old daughter and a three-month boy, I don't know I could have handled both of them without this bouncer. When I need to do some housework or feed my daughter and my little boy is awake, I simply put him on this bouncer, I turn on the vibration and the music (sometimes only vibration) and he stays, relaxes and even falls asleep (which it was wonderful the first 2 months when he didn't want to sleep on his bassinet). It's a good help for moms who are at home alone with babies.",5
"GEENNY Boutique Crib Bedding Set, Baby Girl Artist, 13 Piece","I searched a lot for a new design without any animal or insect print, in bright colors. and this was a great buy. It is beautiful n different.",5
"Bella Tunno Parent Pod Diaper Bag, Lil' Sophisticate","I have this bag in both styles and love them completely. They fit a ton and yet are not huge and unwieldy like a full size diaper bag. I can fit diapers, wipes, snacks,  two bottles, spoons, a few smaller toys, my wallet and my cell phone in it. Also, the handles have hooks on the end so you can slip extra things on the strap if you need to. I especially like the many different pockets both inside and out.  I cannot tell you how many compliments I have gotten from friends and strangers about what a sleek, stylish and yet functional bag the is. I get a compliment nearly every new place I take it.  Best purchases of new mommy hood I ever made!",5
"Babe Ease Clean Changer, Blue Gingham","I like this diaper changing pad. Its surface is soft cotton, bottom layer is water resistant and size is just right. Plus it's very portable. Originally I want to buy the fancy sea life one but they are more expensive. At least you need two to use alternately in case one get dirty and need to be washed. I think it's just for changing diaper and no need to be so beautiful so I got two of the simple style, one pink and one blue. So far they work very well. But I would suggest the velcro should be moved to the back in stead of front and should have something to prevent it from sticking when opened up.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"This little exercise machine is great to get some of our sons never ending supply of energy out. Additionally, it has been really fun to watch him learn to control and play with the different toys. A must have for any high energy baby!",5

Better than the old kickmats that I bought from Babies R Is.  Easy to install and keeps the back of the front seats clean.,4
"Lollaland Lollacup, Good Green","My daughter just turned 3, so I thought it was time to transition her from a spout sippy to a straw cup.  When I saw the Lollacup's adorable and innovative design, I knew I wanted to my daughter to try it!Overall, I like many things about the cup-- but I'm disappointed in what I feel is a very limited usefulness. I'll explain by breaking down the cup's pros and cons.PROS:-Adorable design!-Well-made... The plastic seems sturdy.-Made in the U.S.A.!  I'm happy to support that!-Non-toxic-Very easy to clean and assemble (and even comes with a tiny cleaning brush for the straw)-Liquid moves through the straw with great ease (the cup is valveless).-The bottom of the straw is weighted, so your child can hold the cup at any angle, and the straw will &#34;find&#34; the liquid-Replacement parts are easy to obtain, if needed-The company seems to have excellent customer service, based on what I've read-The handles are easily removed. And, they have a clever design that allows you to snap them onto the bottom of the cup. This means that you don't have to unscrew the lid in order to replace or remove the handles!-When closed, the cup doesn't leak if it is briefly tipped over, dropped, or shaken. However, I wouldn't recommend it for travel or prolonged rough handling (see last point in &#34;cons&#34;).-My daughter loved the bright color, bird design, and the &#34;big girl&#34; straw!CONS:-The flip top is slightly difficult for my 3-year old to open.  It involves pushing back the bird's head feathers so that the front half of the flip top slides to back, allowing the straw to pop out. I usually need to help my daughter with this.-There is a learning curve with this cup. If your child is used to spout sippies, it is very likely that you'll have some spills initially. My daughter sometimes tips the cup too far when drinking, and this causes it to leak. She also can be careless with it while holding the open cup, and this causes leaks too. This cup is not meant to be thrown, tipped, or swung around while open! And, your child will need to learn how to close the cup properly when it isn't in use. For these reasons, I probably would not recommend it for a young toddler unless you have the patience to teach him or her how to use it properly-- and don't mind some leaks.-The cup does not seem to travel well. I made the mistake of placing it in my daughter's backpack for an outing, and it leaked--even with the flip top closed. The water that leaked seemed to have traveled through the straw hole, into the closed lid, and through the lid's seams. I will not bring this cup on another outing, unless I intend to have it secure and upright (in a cup holder) the entire time.The bottom line? If your toddler can be taught how to use this sippy properly ( not tipping too far or throwing it while open, closing the lid when finished, etc.), AND you aren't looking for a sippy that can be thrown in your diaper bag without spills, then this sippy could be a good choice.I was hoping to find something that traveled a little better and leaked less. But, because this cup almost needs to be treated with the same care as a proper drinking glass (held upright and handled carefully to avoid leaks), it's something I only intend to use at home. One plus is that, if my daughter get the hang of this sippy, transitioning to her an actual drinking glass might be easy.",3
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,We were rather disappointed with this warmer and ended up returning it and getting the Dex warmer which works MUCH better. Warmers are meant to just take the chill out of the wipes but this one didnt do that very well. The lid is also inconvenient to use - you have to push a button to open and close it each time; no easy flipping like the Dex. Not worth it!,2
"Naturepedic Waterproof Fitted Crib Pad, 28x52","Seems to be doing the job, has been through three kids in two years, no messes have leaked through to the mattress.  I wish the price was lower, especially so I could but a spare, but happy to have a healthier alternative.",5
"Dreambaby Pressure Mount Hallway Gate with Extensions, Black",We use this gate to keep my son enclosed in the living room.  It was easy to install and works really well. It is rather sturdy (my son likes to rattle the gate sometimes).  My only advice is that the gate is more suitable for walls that do not have a molding on the bottom.,5
Summer Infant Secure Surround Playsafe Playard,i have hard wood floors and the stupid thing don't stay in one spot so my son pushes it all over the place so it don't work for me at all,3
Milk It Kit - Back to Work Survival Kit for Breastfeeding Pumping Moms (includes privacy door sign),Loved this!! I use the do not disturb sign and the milk labels on everything! I particularly loved the hand written note and the pumping pack list! Because of this I had everything I needed when I went back to work! One less thing I had to stress about which was awesome!,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"I bought it when my son was one and half month old. He loves it very much, and can lay on it for about 30 minutes. That's very helpful when we have dinners.",5
"Trend Lab Brown 6&quot; Tall Letter, Letter W","I bought these letters to spell out my son's name in his bedroom. I spray painted them red, and the paint went and stayed on easily. I had a little trouble getting them to hang evenly, but I'm not sure I can blame that fully on the product- that could be a personal challenge! A good size, I recommend these!",5
"Eddie Davenport Duffle, Bauer","We love the look - my husband and I both enjoy carrying this. The included changing pad and storage case are great features. It's a little bulky for carrying into the grocery store, etc. when full, and slightly on the too small side if packing for a big day out where you won't be near the house or car, but so goes it with most diaper bags. Unfortunately it's already falling apart after one year's use. The velcro came detached from the top flap where it closes, so we can no longer just velcro it shut without zipping. Too bad, because that was a convenient feature. Additionally, the zipper pull on the side pocket fell off so we had to put something on the zipper to be able to use it. I really don't think we are that rough with it, it just seems like it was somewhat poorly constructed, but overall it's a nice bag with good features, especially for the price.",4
The First Years Take &amp; Toss Straw Sippers (4-Pack),"The Take & Toss cups are generally good and we like them. But this 5-pack is bad for a few reasons. First, the colored cups make it impossible to know what's in the cup: water, juice or milk? Second, the colors are actually pretty ugly.Finally, First Years annoyingly does not include a cup and cap in each of the five colors.My 5-pack contained:2 green cups2 blue cups1 yellow cup, 1 yellow top2 red tops2 orange topsIf you look closely at the product images and keep in mind that the five cups are on the bottom, with the five caps on top, you'll notice that they have the same problem: 2 cups in color A, 2 cups in color B, 1 cup and 1 top in color C, 2 tops in color D, and 2 tops in color E.It's just strange and lazy. Makes no sense at all. But even if you can get past this, just get the clear Take & Toss cups.",2
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White","We started having to lock our cats upstairs and got really sick of climbing over the old plastic baby gate whenever we wanted to go upstairs.  This gate has greatly improved our quality of life, and works like a charm.  The gate is easy to open and fairly wide.  Also had to order the extension because I misread the dimensions, whoops.My only complaint is that I had major issues getting the end caps out to put in the extension.  Trying to pry the piece out w/ a screw driver like you're supposed to broke the plastic.  I scraped up the gate trying to get those caps out.  Ended up using WD-40 and then was able to pry the piece out.  Other than the major end cap issues installation was a breeze.  I was really concerned when I saw the big gap - thought the gate would never line up to close, but it truly is meant to be like that.",4
Summer Infant Sure Sight Digital Color Video Monitor,"I really love this monitor. The price is right and it was very easy to set up.I purchased an additional camera for when we have another baby but have not set it up yet. I like that it has this capability though... it was definitely a selling feature for me.No, the screen isn't huge, but it is plenty big enough to be able to see into the entire crib.I haven't had a problem with any white noise or constant buzzing coming from the receiver. We run a fan while my baby is sleeping so I always hear noise in the background anyway.Nope, no 2-way communication to be able to soothe the baby from a different room, but lets face it, this monitor is less than $100 which is very inexpensive for a quality video monitor. It isn't a problem for me anyway.I haven't had any problems with the range of the receiver either. We have a 2-story, 2400 sq ft house and I have excellent reception in every room. I haven't taken this outside yet because its just too cold out.The battery lasts plenty long enough to last throughout the day. I leave it on and plugged in overnight then off and plugged in until nap time and the battery charges just fine.I am very happy with this purchase.",5
TUPPERWARE Shape O Ball Toy,I love this classic toy.  I figure it will still be around when my kids are having kids.  It is just such a great toy,5
"Baby Diego Bathinette Posh, Pearl","I have a bad back and using the regular bathtub or our small sink was out of the question for our baby. I found this and knew it would solve all my problems. We don't use the folding function so I can't comment on it. The bathtub is setup for a left  handed person but I have gotten used to it. The height is perfect, no back pain when bathing or changing my daughter. It's sturdy and has decent storage room, although I wish there was a little more of it. I love the draining system, the tube is long and while it's true that it's difficult to empty the entire tub, all you have to do is detach it from the frame and tilt the tub so that it empties completely. No biggy, easy solution.The only downside is that there's no pad cover to put on the table. The table is easy to clean but I would have preferred a removable pad cover to wash separately. I did contact the company about it and they said that they are actually working on creating one. Otherwise, they told me you can also purchase a new top directly from them. I will probably do that when I use it for our next baby.I love this changing table and highly recommend it.",5
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,"Our 9 months old daughter started biting around her crib and we thought this product may help to prevent her from destorying her crib.  However, we were disappointed that the tape did not stick well at all and my daughter was able to pull it off on her own.  We obviously could not use this product.  Don't waste your money to purchase this.  Wrapping around fleece material cloth or some type of blanket and tying it with ribbons worked just fine for us.",1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,Our daughter has been enamored with Jacques since she was 2 months old.  At almost 6 months she still reaches for him and enjoy his pretty colors and crinkly feathers.  This is the only toy that can hold her attention for long periods of time.  She does not like any of the other Lamaze toys (including the turtle whose mirror is too hard for an infant).,5
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","Takes too long to warm bottles which were on the fridge.

"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","we bought this for my daughter because we do a combination of breast feed and formula feed. This one is more natural to other bottles we have used before and also the ventaire technology is simple yet amazing. our daughter used to get a lot of gas with AVENT bottles but ever since we switched to these she did not have any problems. Also you dont have to burp her as much, very minimal amount of gas actually goes in while feeding.i recommend this product to every parents.",5

"Britax Advocate 65 CS Click &amp; Safe Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","Comparing this rear facing until 35lbs car seat to others available in the Britax USA line, the Advocate seems to be the best available.The most obvious change beyond the Boulevard, is the air bag like cushions affixed to either side of the head area.Less obvious differences are: weight, the Decathlon weighs only 15.5 lbs, the much loved Marathon only weighs 16.5 lbs, the Boulevard weighs 19lbs, and finally the Advocate weighs a hefty 21 lbs; the depth/width measurements of the wider and deeper Decathlon are 9.5/11.5, the Marathon, Boulevard, and Advocate are all 9/11 inches; seating compartment height, the Decathlon is tallest, only by a fraction of an inch, the Marathon is the shortest by 1/4 inch; the Advocate and the Boulevard offer the most shoulder space, greater than 1.5"" difference.However, after researching car seats, I am profoundly sorry to say, this *NEW(!)* car seat is still not as safe as those available in Sweden and in the UK which can cost less than half the list price of an Advocate. Let me rephrase this comment, Britax UK/Britax Sweden car seats are safer for children passengers, than Britax USA car seats, and they're ALSO less expensive on average.According to most recent research the most vulnerable areas of car crashes are the solidity of the base, and side impact. However, it is also important to note rear facing children are 5 times more safe than forward facing kids in a head-on collision. Safety experts say children's skeletons and muscles aren't able to cope with the forces in a head-on collision until they are four years old, which is why in Sweden, children are rear-facing until they weigh 55lbs.This appears to be an unfortunate corporate decision, rather than a decision based on regulation. US regulations state seats must meet a certain threshold to be deemed ""safe"", UK/Swedish seats exceed the threshold. Clearly deciding to sell less safe seats in the USA was not based on cost or market: it's less expensive to manufacture in the USA than in the UK or Sweden, free trade enables duty free importing, the US market supports a product line of seats which already exceed the cost of UK seats.What kind of company would make a decision to sell less safe car seats for substantially more money, to parents of American children, because there is a lower threshold of regulation in which to meet?For skeptical parents, please visit the Britax.co.uk website to compare side-by-side photos of (larger & more advanced) car seat bases, and the width and depth of side cushions on: the Eclipse, First Class plus, Evolve 1-2-3, the Baby Safe line, and all the others for that matter. Then visit the Britax.se site, to examine rear facing until 55lbs, Britax MultiTech, Britax Hi-Way, Britax Two-Way.I am disappointed that this appears to be the best seat available to US children, and look forward to one day buying a much better American made product.Most, if not all of us would prefer safe to sleek any day.(Apparently carseat.se is one vender who would sell to english speaking American buyers. But I'm not sure if there is a premium for doing so!)",3
Britax B-Ready Mosquito Net,Don't waste your money on this. It barely stays on the B-Ready and the bottom does not attach to anything. When you recline the stroller for baby to take a nap the bottom of the net lays on their feet. It flops around in the slightest of breeze or if you walk fast.Britax makes a much better net for the B-Agile -Britax B-Agile Stroller UV Mosquito Net- I tested it and it fits the B-Ready too! The B-Agile net has elastic to keep it tight around the bottom. I highly recommend it.,1

"Lansinoh mOmma Feeding Bottle, 5 Ounce","I am a breastfeeding mom who needs to use bottles for some feedings which is why I bought this bottle. I read some great reviews about the nipple, so I bought the bottle, but just as the other reviews indicate, the bottle doesn't drain completely because of the design. You would have to lay the infant flat on her back in order to drain the bottle. This results in waste of precious breastmilk! The plastic was also pretty cheap. The one nice thing about the bottle is its small size. However, the bottle is nearly identical to the tommee tippee bottle which doesn't have the problem with draining. Don't wast the time or money on these.",1

BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,"This stool is not decorative, but it does what it is intended to do. I also have the cute, wooden step stool type of stool, but I needed a stool for a small bathroom where function took precedence over form.

"Beco Butterfly II Organic Baby Carrier with Brown Base, Espresso","I did a lot of research before buying this carrier. I have a bad back and was worried about having an uncomfortable carrier. I haven't quite got the positioning of my 6 week old perfected and sometimes he doesn't enjoy it (I think because of the positioning (once he had his nose against my chest and couldn't breathe and got really upset)), but the carrier is very comfortable and once he gets a little bigger (he was a 5 1/2 pound baby), I think it will work really well. I would recommend this carrier but just to be careful that a baby's nose is not pressed against your chest.",5
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack, Lavender or Citrus","These are not worth the money- at all.  They barely had much effect.  If you need baking soda, just go buy a few boxes and either make your own sachets with them or use the whole box like one might do for a freezer/frdge.",2

Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After the first 6 months I would have been rating this diaper pail top of the heap.  Certainly not having to buy special bags is a HUGE advantage... and the hole is larger that the genie so you don't have to worry about the &quot;squish&quot; factor as much.The problem, and the reason others had a smell problem is that this pail has large foam washers and a foam pad in the top section that get rank after time.  Luckily we just called the company and they sent new ones and the smell went when they did, but it was a bit of a pain.  I still think it was worth it to buy this one!",3
"DaVinci Parker 4 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Pure White",Very lovely crib.  I ordered the espresso finish but it looks more like a dark cherry.  It is still very pretty.  The drawer is not really very sturdy.,4
phil &amp; teds Classic Stroller with Double Kit - Black,"Over all, I have had a great experience with this stroller.  I have two babies 12 months apart.  I have the carseat attachment and the second child attachment.  I go running every day with my 20 month old in the back second child seat, and my 8 month old in his carseat in the front attached with the bungee cord bobbles... (not sure what Phil & Ted's calls them).  My 20 month old girl gets enough shade by being in the backseat, and I have a carseat canopy to protect my son in the front.  Once in a while when my 20 month old falls asleep in the car, and the 8 month old is awake, I put him in the second child seat, up on the front attachment, and lay the front seat down flat for my 20 month old.  She is extra tall but fits nicely underneath him.  I have never seen another design so convenient to use.I have had common problems you might experience with any jogger type stroller, which has to do with the wheels going flat.  I called Phil & Ted's and in my customer-is-right attitude informed them I was well out of warranty, but that I thought the wheels had a faulty design, and wanted a replacement.  They were 100% kind and sincerely apologized, promptly sending me TWO more sets of tires.  Since then, after talking to my friends with many different types and brands of joggers, I learned that flat tires is a common problem in any jogger that have bike-type tires, and they need the same type of repair/maintenance as bike tires.  Phil & Ted's customer service could have been defensive and rude, but they were only helpful and generous. (Thanks customer service!)In addition to awesome customer service, I have been pleased with the design of the jogger.  It is easy to put together in the morning, and easy to fold up for my errand runs with the kids.  The tires are quiet and soft, making napping easy for my babies.  I like how narrow the jogger is to fit through tight isles in the store.  I prefer it to a shopping cart if I don't have too much to buy.After two years, I am still in love with my Phil & Teds.",5
"Vulli 2 Pack Vanilla Flavored Ring Teethe, Colors May Vary",We have lifefactory's teethers and like them much better then these.  They smell very vanilla-y which is pleasant and they are easy for our baby to hold but not that easy for him to put in his mouth comfortably.  They are more of a toy in our family then a helpful teether.,3
Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor,"The monitor itself had an easy set up and I like that you can view multiple cameras on one device. The product worked fine for the first three months. That seems to be a trend from the reviews that I have read. However, the monitor no longer charges. I have tried to contact the Summer Company with no sucess. Ironically when you go to its website the monitor is supposedly an award winner. Regardless, I have still not heard back from the company and I would never buy a Summer Product again. Its bad enough that I have a product that does not work, but to have awful customer service just makes it worse. Would not recommend this monitor to anyone. Spend your money elsewhere.",1
Scoop of Love Stainless-Steel Ice Cream Scoop,Bought these as baby shower gift. Haven't used it personally but they arrived quickly and well packaged and definitely a good gift.,4
"Badger Basket Baby Changing Table with Six Baskets, Black","I've never written a public, negative review of a product. There's a first time for everything...Words cannot describe the seething, firey hatred I have for this item. I have hated it actively, several times a day, every day, since I brought my first baby home in January 2011. When I looked at the pic, I presumed that the ""baskets"" sat on full, shelf-like dividers, like soft-sided drawers that just aren't connected to the unit. I even figured you didn't have to use the baskets, you could just take them out and use the shelves instead. That's not at all how this piece is designed. The only ""shelf"" is the top, where you put the changing mattress. Below that is just what I'd call a ""skeleton""--kind of like staging?--designed to hold the baskets in place. In other words, see those two horizontal black lines in the picture that appear to be pieces of wood that separate the three ""drawers"" from one another? They're just shadows. Seriously. If you enlarge the picture and strain your eyes, you'll see there is NO WOOD THERE. The picture is just taken to make it *look* like there's something there.So fine, I misinterpreted the photo. My bad. But without these separations, the unit is more or less useless. Instead of sitting on platforms, the baskets hover over each other on these thin little runners--just one on each side. The problem is that the gap between the runners is prolly about 1/16"" wider than the basket, tops. So if you don't balance the basket on the runners PERFECTLY, one side will collapse down into the drawer below it. This happens just about every time you open and close a drawer. And the issue gets worse as time goes on and the baskets start to warp a little bit from use. The 400th time you're struggling to yank open a misaligned basket with one hand while wrangling a crying baby with the other, you'll understand my ragey hate. Ragey, ragey, flaming, sparkly hate.Do Not Buy This. If you insist on having one, please, for the love of all that's Holy, come take mine. Take it far, far away. You would be doing me a great service.",1
Levana BABYVIEW20 Interference Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby Camera,"Another mom referred this product to me and I absolutely love it.  I have had it for 1.5 years and it's the best.  I love being able to see if he's crying standing up or lying down.  If he's lying down and he cries some, I know he'll go back to sleep.  If he's standing up, then I know he must need something.  It's so helpful.  I can even see if he's standing in his crib and pooping!  Only problem is right now the cord to the baby monitor broke so I am contacting the company to see if they can replace the cord.  Otherwise, this has been an excellent product.",4
"Cosco Funsport Playard, Into the Woods","I found the mattress to be about 4 inces too short. This would be dangerous for young infants as they could easily get caught between mattress and side. I am very surprised it has not been recalled. I ordered this for our condo ahead of our arrival. I would have sent it back, but was over the return date.",2
Baby Einstein Sea Dreams Soother,He was 6 months old when I bought him this and he loved it.  He follows it with his eyes and bangs on it.,5
"Playtex DisneyInsulator Spout Cup, Finding Nemo, 9 Ounce, 2-Count",Our old cups had gotten hard to clean so we changed to Playtex. The firstyears cup valve does not some out so they were hard to clean but theses come apart which make them much easier to clean. They are insulated so they do not sweat when you put them on the table. They are great!,5
"Protect-a-Bub Single Compact Sunshade, Black","This product is fantastic.  It fits perfectly on our Chicco Cortina.  The existing shade on the Cortina is thick and nice but almost worthless because it's too small.  This product is simply necessary and it works just as I'd hoped.  The angles to block sun so it does a good job even when walking towards the sun.  When my baby is in shorts on really hot days, I have to either cover his legs or put a lot of sunblock on because they do get some sun, but most of him is in the shade.  If they made an even bigger one, or a UV protective bubble (just kidding), I'd buy the biggie.",5
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant","These are awesome and keep my girls warm during my jogs.  They love being in the stroller and it has been a really cold winter for Houston, Texas so I wasn't taking them out in the stroller much due to being worried about them being too cold.  These changed that.  I put them in socks, fleece footed pjs, a coat and hat and then into these.  They stay warm and are happy to be out on runs with mommy again.  I cannot speak to how well these work in really cold temps as 30's and 40's is about as cold as it gets here, but these certainly work better than blankets that they just kick off.",5
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink","The quality of this is amazing. It is literally a miniature version of something you would have for your living room set. We don't have the rockers on ours as of yet since our son is only 10 months old, but this looks just adorable and classy at the same time sitting in our living room. Our son is using it to help himself stand up right now and dance in the middle of the living room, and I can't wait until he wants to sit in it to watch cartoons. The rockers look easy to apply, just plastic and screws. We will probably put them on at some point. Also, as other people's reviews stated, I can't imagine a 6 year old child sitting in this. Not even a 4 year old. Your kid would have to be EXTREMELY petite and short to sit in this thing for THAT long. I say 1-3 is the ideal time window for this chair for the average sized child.",5
Jeep Deluxe Stroller Weather Shield,I'm giving the Jeep Deluxe Stroller Weather shield 5 stars because it does what it is intended to do. It fits over my lightweight combi stroller very well and snugly and keeps my son dry in our unpredictable Florida weather.,5

Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"Excelent product. Extremely useful! At first thought this was for talking to the baby. Sometimes (particularly in the evenings), baby will be soothed by just changing the diaper/holding/etc. However, if this isn't the case it is easy to radio to your spouse (likely trying to get some sleep) that he/she is really needed (for breast feeding for example).just get one and you will be surisfied",4

Little Reader Sofa Color: Orange,"This is a cute sofa that is a decent size for being a little kids pull out couch. However, when the item arrived it was in poor packaging and already had some stains on it. Since my son opened it and immediately wanted to use it we just tried to clean it and let him keep it. I regret this now, but live and learn.The item isn't that easy to clean and shows every speak of dirt.I did contact customer service about the staining issues and they weren't all the helpful or receptive. For a kids company, I found their customer service not so great and that made me rate this item a 2, instead of a 3.The material on this does seem higher quality than a lot of the &#34;shiny&#34; sofas out there, but not sure it is worth the extra money - especially given the customer service and the poor packaging.",2
"green sprouts 10 Pack Waterproof Absorbent Terry Bibs, Girls",These are amazing waterproof bibs! Love the colors and lack of pattern so you can match then to outfits easily. My daughter is very drolly and so wears these all the time. Saves on washing clothes and keeps her little chest dry and rash free! Colors wash well without fading.,5
"12-Pack Shock Guards, White Plastic","Used these all over the house for child #1.  I still have them, and will bust them back out for #2 on the way.  They fit, they're cheap, hard to remove (which is good) and they pack enough of them.",5
BOB Infant Car Seat Adapter for Graco Single Strollers,We bought this to use with our newly purchased bob. We just assembled everything and went for a walk and a slight jog.  It held the car seat secure.  I am very pleased with how easy it was to assemble and how well it works.,5
Little Kid Backpack Nigel (Shark),We purchased this backpack for our Three year old who was going to start going to preschool.  The bag is more then large enough to hold a folder for notes without needing to bend the folder. No Side pouch.,5
"Regalo Guardian Expandable Gate, White","After two weeks of using it, we returned this.  It's too heavy and bulky for us.  If you are going to be moving it more than once a day, don't get this as it may be too heavy for you too.  I got a bamboo and plastic one thats half the weight and seems as sturdy so far.",2
Sassy Bumble Bites Teether -- 1 Toy,"I must say, i purchased this teether when my son was about 5 months and it was light & easy enough for my son to hold. He grew more fond of it as his teeth stared to come in and it is a daily teether now. The lightweight and different textures are fantastic for massaging his gums and the plyable water filled blue wing is perfect to sooth when chilled.",5
Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature First Sips Weaning Cup - 4m - 5 Oz. (Pink),"Not sure why Amazon is charging so much more for this item.  This is a great first sippy, my daughters little hands fit the handles perfectly.  No issues with leaking if you twist the cap on correctly!  Please save yourself some money and buy it at Babies R Us....$5.99 each!!",5
"Summer Infant Secure Surround Play Safe Play Yard, Tan","After researching many baby and pet play pens I decided on this one.  I am sure glad I did.  This was the most value for my money and turned out to be just what I needed.  We have a new labrador puppy and I didn't want to use a traditional dog crate.  He's about 11 weeks now and he loves it, goes right to it to take a nap.  This pen is well made and easy to put together and take down.  It's tall enough for now and gives him enough room to have seperate areas for sleep, eat and potty pad if needed (hasn't had to use it though :)I work in a large pet store chain store and feel this is better than the metal ones we sell, based both on quality and price.",5
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,"Excellent product! We ordered 2 for our two children. I was a bit skeptical when ordering, due to a few of the ""not so happy reviews"" but I am glad I got these trays. They are soft (and therefore safe) but sturdy enough for those little arts & crafts while on the road. I would recommend to everyone. We have Britax Marathon car seats and these trays fit perfect.",5

Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"I'm so glad we elected to do the baby bucket + stroller base frame rather than one of those full-metal stroller systems.  For one thing, the frame is a lot lighter and easier to fold and get in and out of a trunk -- a LOT easier.  Also, by the time my son reached the age when the bucket + frame no longer worked for us, we had come to realize that the kind of stroller we wanted was a lightweight umbrella-style stroller, NOT one of those massive things that come as part of a stroller-carseat-base system.My only quibble with this frame is that it didn't quite stand up to the huge strain we put on it.  My son needed to be pushed back and forth for hours at a time in order to sleep when he was a newborn, and so the beating this frame took was probably miles more than it was designed for.  It started to squeak and became a little wobbly, such that my husband had to keep spraying lubricant and tightening bolts to keep it quiet enough not to wake the boy up and sturdy enough that we didn't worry about it falling to bits.For normal use, though, I'm sure it would be just fine.",4
Baby Boom I Luv Zebra Plush Blanket,This was a baby shower gift and it was perfect!! Great quality. Arrived quickly and in secure packaging for cleanliness.,5

"Peg Perego Convertible Infant to Toddler Car Seat, Black",This car seat is wonderful!  I love the Peg Perego products and was thrilled to see a convertible car seat.  I have a small two door car which it fits well in both rear facing and forward facing.  The quality is well worth the price!,5

"Tree Branches Wall Decal Love Birds Vinyl Sticker Nursery Leaves 56&quot; Wide X 28&quot; High (Left to Right, Matte White)",Item arrived in 2 days. Looks just like the picture.

"Cocalo 2 Piece Canvas Art, Peek A Boo Monsters",These were adorable canvas paintings!  They are part of the hard to find Cocalo Peek-a-boo Monsters collection. I would recommend them to dress up baby's room or just add a little character.,5
"Regalo Top of Stair Gate, White","It is hard to open and close and it is not a sturdy product, as it broke few times. Thank god that Amazon is great about replacements, otherwise we would return it right away. The only advantage is that this is almost the only product that you can buy to use with the banisters.",2
Infantino Wrist (Frog &amp; Duck) &amp; Foot (Bunny &amp; Cat) Rattle Set,From 0 months + your baby will enjoy this gender neutral rattle set even my 1year old niece even enjoys it i constantly tell her its not  age appropriate but she doesnt care buy it either for your baby or a baby shower gift they won't be disappointed,5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"When my daughter was born she slept in her swing a lot, but it didn't have anything to keep her entertained while she was awake.  Seeing as I'm a stay at home mom, I need somewhere to set her down while I make dinner and she was just bored to tears in the plain, no bells and whistles, swing.  She LOVES the mobile on this swing, as well as the water globe and nature sounds.  The swing itself is pretty nice.  The only drawback is that after ONE week in this swing, it started to make this squeaky creaky sound.  OMG, it's awful.  I'm listening to it right now and it literally sounds like it might fall apart.  I think it really bothers my daughter because she now has a hard time napping in it.  She is only 12lbs too, so FAR below the weight limit on the swing.  She's not even two months old, and I'm sad to say that we'll probably be breaking out the old no frills swing before she outgrows this one.  I don't think WD-40 will work on plastic!  I am so frustrated.",3
"Carter's Green Elephant Rug, Green/Choc, 30 X 40&quot;",The rug is adorable! I bought the entire set as a baby shower gift and it looks great in the nursery!!,5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Twin Electric Breast Pump,"I purchased this pump after reading reviews for breast pumps for weeks. I was still pregnant when I got it, and didn't really expect to use it much because I planned to nurse as much as possible. Well my son decided about a week after coming home that he didn't want to latch, and against the lactation consultants advice to just keep trying- I started pumping...every.three.hours....and G hammered bottles but each day when I would try to get him to latch he would just scream! I delivered him on 9/30 and started pumping about 8 days later. I think it was a let a down issue. Anyhow, the pump was awesome. I was getting my 9 bottles a day and then some. I had about 60 bags of 6 ounces or more saved...middle of November I started to notice it took me like 35 minutes to get just enough for one bottle- at that point it was 5 ounces. I felt like it still worked, but I had to tap into my saved milk- we are down to 5 bags. I tried everything- drank gallons of water- ate every time I pumped- I had a feeling it wasn't me but it was the pump. So, I ordered all new parts for it (the valves and the diaphragms) and got the same results I had been getting, I was getting really discouraged and wanted to give up (which I think a lot of people would have done). So my friend was waiting for me to pump one day about two weeks ago...and after 40 minutes passed she suggested that I try her Medela pump...so I did. What a difference and it was immediate I pumped 5 ounces at my 3:00 pump (with the Avent pump) and then with the Medela I pumped almost 9 ounces at my 6:30 pump. So here we are...a couple weeks later and I am getting my freezer filled with milk again and I am not worrying that I will have to give my little guy formula.I was going to review this pump after like the first month, because at that point it was a lifesaver, and my guess would be, if you are using it just in between feedings and at work its probably great. It's quiet, easy to pack up (does not have a car cord- Medela does), and at first very fast. So maybe if it wasn't used as often as I use my pump it would be good. But I just fear someone else will be in my shoes and instead of spending even more money on a pump they will just give up and I'd hate to think a pump would stop someone from breast feeding. So my advice- buy the Medela. I get between 6 and 10 ounces each time and I am done in under 15 minutes usually. The pump that I am reviewing isn't cheap though it does cost less than the Medela. But in this case, you really do get what you pay for. It really sucks that I have to give a product that at one point I raved about a horrible review. Seriously, think twice before you buy this pump if you aren't sure how you will be using it.",2
"Munchkin Wood and Steel Designer Gate, Dark Wood/Silver","This gate had many parts and they didn't fit together well. The instructions are TERRIBLE, no words-just pictures.

Yookidoo Flow 'N Fill Spout Bath Toy (9m+),I got this for my son (1 yr old) because he just would not play with any of the toy's I put in the tub with him (but he would play with running water).  First time I put him in a bath with this he was absolutely spell bound.  He actually sat still while we got the whole soaping up and rinsing off part of the bath over with.  Then he spent about 30 min just running his fingers under the running water.  When he figured out he could move the cups around he lit up like a christmas tree.  For the first time the only part of the bath he fussed about was when we drained the water and took him out.  I am going to buy this as the baby shower gift dejour.  Can't believe it took me an entire year to find this toy.,5

Maxboost Fusion Snap-on iPhone 5S/5 Case - Navy Blue (Fit Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5S/5),I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation and I really like it!

Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"I have used Diaper Genie for seven years now.  I purchased the New Genie to replace my old worn out one, and it is easier to use.  The only problems I have is occasionally the plastic won't cut if I get things in the wrong position.  You have to learn from experience to get the technique down right.  Be sure after cutting the plastic to turn the handle while open to get the cutter to click back to the original position.  I have loved using Diaper Genie!  It keeps things so neat!An experienced mom and grandma.",4
Fisher-Price Precious Planet  Blue Sky Jumperoo,"Let me start off by saying the first of these I received (purchased) had a few manufacturing flaws.  One of the base pipes was not manufactured properly and no matter how many times we switched them around, would not go together.  The plastic molded seat has 4 wheels attached on the bottom so it can go around 360 degrees.  Ours had 1 wheel missing, making it impossible to even fit in, let alone twirl.  I had reviewed many jumperoos and wanted this one because of the soft blue overhead tube to attach toys to so I ordered another one immediately through Amazon and it came the very next day before I even had time to send the ""bad"" one back.  Thank you Amazon!  I am glad I did.  Being a grandma with a 4 month old grandson who just got to the point he is tired of always being placed on his playmat, bumbo chair, or carried around in grandmas arms, the first day he tried this jumperoo he is one happy little guy!  Like most other reviewers his feet do not touch the floor yet and I played around with different size pillows for the full effect of jumping, he loves all the toys, the music, and the fact that grandma doesn't have to hold him in the standing position, he can do it (to some extent) himself.  He wears himself out jumping and therefore naps better, too.  Grandma loves that).",5

RazBaby Raz-Berry Teether Light Blue,This teether is great.  It is too big for the baby's mouth to suck so it encourages the baby to chew instead.  Our little one seems to be able to get some comfort from teething with the teether.,5
Performance Carrier Color: Charcoal Black,"As if I did not love this carrier enough, the other day I saw a mom wearing her baby in the grocery store and it opened up a whole new world of love! I'd had trouble bringing baby to run errands because it was cumbersome to have either the bucket seat or a stroller. With baby in the Ergo, I've got hands free and enough space in the cart to get what we need. The waistband is very comfortable and baby loves to sleep in it when we're out and about. Two thumbs way up!",5

Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought the Mozart Magic Cube 3 years ago for our grandkids' toybox at our home. This past summer, one of the little ones left this outside - of course it rained. When we found it the next day we thought the cube was finished as it was completely silent (I have no idea why I didn't throw it out). After a few months it surprised us and started making music again. It still looks and works like new - even after spending a night in the rain and after 3 years of abuse from a large contingent of young grandchildren. The kids - from the babies to 8 years - continue to enjoy playing with it.",5

Tommee Tippee Milk Feeding Bibs - Cream - 2 Pk - Boy,"I use these bibs as teething bibs to catch all of my son's drool.  These are the only bibs I know of that have the padding near the neckline.  Love these bibs.  They keep his chin and chest dry.  These were also great when he was a newborn, because babies have folds in their necks and if drool or milk gets in there, it can cause a rash.  These bibs keep the neck area dry and protected.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"I purchased this item thinking it would be perfect for those late night diaper changes.  I still think wipes warmers are a good idea, just not this one! This warmer heats from the bottom. I quickly noticed the wipes at the bottom were warmer than the ones at the top. I also noticed that the wipes at the top were a bit dried out and soapy feeling. I returned the warmer and found the PERFECT warmer at a TARGET store.  The target warmer heats from the top to the bottom, which keeps the top wipes moist and warm, just as they should be.  It was a little cheaper in price and it has a lid lock that the other didn't have.  All around it is a better purchase!",2
"Bumkins Reusable Flannel Wipes, 12 Count, Natural",First off these were only 6 bucks a set when I put them in my baby registry....then they were up to 14 when I actually needed them. I ended up getting them anyway because I needed some cloth wipes stat. But I was annoyed at that for sure.You have to wash them several times to get them to absorb anything. At first they just repel water. The seams start fraying off right away and I'm always snipping off loose threads around the border. Now they are shrunken and all ratty after 2 months of use. Meh. I'm sure there are better options out there.,2

Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"The FP Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym works great. The little dude touches any of the four posts (kicking pulling whatever) or grabs onto one of the extra toys (mirror, monkey, twirly thing) and more music and lights. I am very happy with it because I can put him down and he is happy and he rolls around all over on it and it has things on the mat as well to entertain him. He plays for hours grabbing the zebras tail or listening to the leaves crinkle. I recommend this very much and actually felt bad when we received it that we had not got him it before. I was like, bad dad for not getting something cool for the baby earlier. So you will be happy about it for sure.",4
Maxi-Cosi Priori Convertible Car Seat - Penguin,"Our daughter seems pretty enthusiastic about the car seat. It is adjustable and reclines which is great for when she falls asleep in the car. However, it is a 15 to 20 minute exercise to install it. The latch system does a poor job of securing the seat; you actually have to stand in the seat to get a tight fit. Once in the car and secure there are no problems or concerns about its safety. We used the Maxi Cosi infant car seat and were very happy with the ease of install and functionality so we were expecting more of the same.",3

Evenflo Comfort Select Performance Single Electric Breast Pump,This pump is amazing for the price and great for moms who casually pump.

Bugaboo Cameleon Adapter for Select Peg Perego Car Seats,"JUST BE CAREFULE WHEN ORDERING THESE BUGABOO - PEG PEREGO CAR SEAT ADAPTERS THAT IF YOU HAVE A CAR SEAT NEWER THAN 2006 YOU NEED THE BRAND NEW ADAPTORS FROM BUGABOO,PEG PEREGO CHANGES THEIR CAR SEATS OFTEN AND THESE LITTLE TWEEKS MAKE THE OLD ADAPTERS UNUSABLE, SO BUGABOO IS ALWAYS UPDATING THE ADAPTERS.  I ORDERED TWICE FROM SELLERS ON AMAZON WITH CLAIMS THAT THE ADAPTERS WERE NEW WHEN IN FACT THEY ARE NOT AND INDEED DID NOT FIT MY 2010 PEG PEREGO CAR SEAT.  ITS VERY FRUSTRATING PUTTING BABY STUFF TOGETHER EVEN WHEN IT GOES WELL, WHEN TRYING TO FIT PARTS TOGETHER THAT THE SELLERS SAY ARE CORRECT WHEN THEY ARE NOT IS BEYOND TIME CONSUMING AND IRRITATING. IF YOU HAVE A BUGABOO, CONTACT BUGABOO DIRECTLY VIA THEIR WEBSITE AND THEY WILL EMAIL YOU A CORRECT PHOTO OF THE THE ADAPTERS NEEDED FOR YOUR PRAM AND CAR SEAT.  SAVE TIME AND TRIPS TO THE POST OFFICE RETURNING UNUSABLE ADAPTERS BY CHECKING OUT THE CORRECT PARTS FIRST.  :)",1
"Skip Hop 20 Piece 70&quot;x56&quot; PlaySpot Floor Mat, Blue/Gold","I love the color and the material.  There is no odd smell.  However, it takes a good 20 mins for me to clean it up.  Especially when my baby tear it apart and eat the small pieces, I have to clean it up every day.  It's a bit tiresome after a while.",3
"Summer Infant Bentwood Bassinet with Motion, Baby Time",A very nice first bed for a newborn.  It was well received by the new-to-be parents of my 6th great-grandchild (a daughter).,5
Multi Voice Changer by Toysmith: Change your voice with 8 different voice modifiers - Kids Toy (Purple),bought this for grandkids and they have been playing with it everyday since. It is made a lot better than I thought it would be. Item is made very well for a toy. Lots of fun!!!!!,5
Girls Cream Pettiskirt (6 to 8 years),I was hoping for a little more fluff. But for the price it's ok. I'll order a premium one next.,4

"Graco SimpleSwitch Highchair and Booster, Pasadena",We love it it's was easy to assemble and and take apart. When we go to relatives to visit we take it with us and it's absolutely this best thing ever,5
Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Jumperoo,bought for my 4 month old grandson.  only left in for few minutes at first.  Now that he is 5 months old he stays in it for up to 20 minutes.  Very entertaining for him.  great support.  just wish it wasn't so big.,5
"Innobaby Glass Rectangle Food Storage Container, 2 Pack, Yellow/Green","I make all my baby's food.  I love these containers - they are the perfect portion size for a baby.  They are ideal for storing and heating baby food. I pop a couple of frozen, organic, homemade cubes into microwave.  No worries about harmful or stained containers. Best of all, they don't leak and don't take up much room in a bag.",5
"Excellante' Wooden High Chair, Walnut (Packaging May Vary)","I noticed for my baby that the conventional baby seats with the padding did not work well. Our baby was constantly trying to get out of the high chairs.  So, once at a restaurant, we put her in one of these restaurant style chairs, and we noticed, this is what we needed.  I bought one, and it was a synch putting it together - 10 minutes at the most.  We are very happy with the quality of this product.",5
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"I bought these to use during the day at work and so far they've worked great. They're easy to wash and dry, I just throw them in with my regular clothes. I didn't give it 5 stars because you can't wear these with thin clothes or they show. I wear them with a bra that has light padding so it works great that way, but if you wear a thin bra with a silk shirt or dress it would show. I love them though and I still have an unopened box of disposable bra pads that I received as a gift and will probably not use. I bought two packs and might get another one so that I don't have to wash them during the week. Why buy disposables? Seems pretty wasteful to me.",4
"ERGObaby Organic Baby Carrier, Dark Chocolate","I have used many carriers from the Moby Wrap, to Bjorn, to a Snugli and this is by far the most secure and comfortable one I have used. I am still in the newborn stage so not sure how the hip carry will compare to the other ones that can be used front facing, but so far it is great. I have a lot of neck and back problems and so far this doesn't bother me as much as the other ones, the weight is more distributed over my shoulders and lower back than the middle and upper back. I love the hood to keep the sun off his head. It was a little tricky to put on at first, I recommend trying it without a baby a few times to get the hang of it. The instructions say to buckle the side straps after the baby is in, but that was near impossible unless you are double jointed. I leave it buckled and just slide my arms through and buckle the top middle buckle once baby is in place. I checked some other places where I found one cheaper (Ebay for example) and they looked brand new but be careful because they have updated the buckles in the last couple years so you might get an outdated model. I figured it was worth it to pay the extra money to know that I am getting the latest and best model.",5

Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,"I recently went under the care of a chiropractor & was instructed not to sleep on my stomach.  I was having a very difficult time with this task & was getting a little frustrated at all my attempts to follow doctors orders.  Then I remembered when I was pregnant 7 years ago & loved the sleep I was able to get because of my maternity pillow.  I remembered that it helped me once before to fight the need to sleep on my abdomen & immediately started my search for a new one.  They must be a lot more popular now because there are a lot more choices out there & this one in particular far exceeded my expectations!  It is made so nicely, no gaps in the fill, firm but not too hard & a wonderful sleeping companion.  I have been able to sleep on my side because of the pillow & my chiropractor is noticing better results!!",5
Carters Keep Me Dry 3 Pack Flannel Lap Pads ( Color Frogs),I got this for my daughter when my grandson was born. I had a hard time finding these elsewhere. I had these for her when she was a baby.,5
"Blueberry Training Pants, Monkeys, Medium","We bought 2 of these for my son for potty training and we love them so far.  They are very absorbent and if he has an accident in these almost nothing drips out.  I do wish they were a little less expensive or offered in a larger pack at a discount, because we only bought 2 to start but they work great so I suppose they really are worth the extra cost!",5
Baby Jogger Carry Bag,"Purchased this bag as I was taking the Baby Jogger Mini GT overseas for vacation. The bag worked great, easy to store the wheels, perfectly sized to fit the Mini GT. The construction is good, no loose seams, no flaws in the stitching. There is padding to the sides and I felt the stroller was well protected. The only con I can think of is that the bag is bulky and there really is no place to store it. I ended up folding it and storing the bag underneath the stroller. Prior to buying this I read the complaints about the color of the bag that makes it easy to mistake for checked baggage. To remedy this I also bought the JL Childress Gate Check Bag for Standard and Double Strollers, red (also from Amazon). The Mini GT fit perfectly inside the red bag. Since I already spent the money on the Mini GT, I thought an additional $15 for the gate check bag was worth it. All in all, everything worked great, no problems and I would recommend this product.",5
"The Safe Sippy Cup, Blue","I love this sippy.  I have read mixed reviews for the next model up (comes w/straw and extra parts), but I love this basic version (no straw).  This one is simple, leak proof and has held up now for 12 months.  This is a very sturdy sippy.  Just bought another for a baby shower.",5
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink",I ordered this last summer for my friend's baby. Now she's 4 months old and sitting in it! Look like she's comfortable to be in it!,5
"Pacimals: The Huggable Plush Pacifier, Janet the Giraffe","The pacifier may look comparable to a soothie, but don't be fooled - it's not even close. It's super thin, my baby hates it. The giraffe was good sized, but I found it to be too big. The Wubbanub I bought at the same time was quickly  the baby's favorite and my favorite - for different reasons, obviously. The baby liked the Wubbanub better because he could hold it better, move it in and out of his mouth as he liked. He will only take soothies, and this isn't compatible with soothies even though I tried to cram one in there (it semi-worked). I liked the smaller Wubbanub because I can swaddle the giraffe in with his blanket, and he can move his head to it or away from it if he wants it. The Pacimal is too big to swaddle with him. Plus the Wubbanub is cheaper. :)  I gift the Wubbanub to everyone having a baby. If the Wubbanub didn't exist, I might recommend this project. But there is a far superior product that is less costly.I'm not sure if I would rate this differently if my baby liked other pacifiers - that is the difference - the Wubbanub isn't compatible with other pacifiers.",2
"green sprouts  Favorite Food Bib, Red Milk","those are great bibs, they are very easy to put in and because of its larger size, it keeps my son's clothers clean for a longer.",5
"Serta Perfect Start Crib Mattress, White",I was impressed with the price and impressed with the product. My four year old only needs this for a couple of years until he grows out his toddler bed. Can't beat this deal even at uncle Wally's. Low price and free shipping. what a great find!,5
Eddie Bauer&reg; 2-in-1 Harness Buddy,"My 1 year old went from crawling straight to RUNNING.  I bought this harness after I set him down in a store while I paid at the checkout, and he was gone in a flash.  Luckily, we were the only ones in the small store.  It scared me enough to search out a harness.  We tried it on at home and it works great!  It comes fully assembled, all you do is click the two belts into place.  It goes on like a vest.  It's light and soft and loose enough to not bother him at all.  He wears it around like a backpack and thinks he's pretty awesome with his new accessory.  We only use it when we're out shopping and there are no carts for him to sit in, though.  But please use it sparingly - if I wanted a wild thing on a leash, I would have bought a puppy.",5
Munchkin Deluxe Drying Rack,I needed a drying rack for in our camper.  This is the perfect one!  It holds a fair amount of bottles and all the bits and parts.  We use Dr Browns so there are extra pieces.  We also have medicine syringes.  The different size pegs and clamps are awesome!  The best part is that it folds down flat for easy storage.  I am so glad I found this rack!,5
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump - 17070,"I've used it for over 4 months and everything works great! I also bought additional caps, which was broken when I tried to pull them out for cleaning. I think you'd better twist them out gentlly... It is very convienient to be carried anywhere, and very efficient to pump out milk. My baby got ""nipple confusion"" when we fed her with formula from bottles in hospital. She wasn't able to latch on after we tried all means. The pump saves both her and me!!! I heard from a lot of warnings that using pump would eventually cause early weaning, but that is not true from my experience. I pumped very frequently at the first two months to establish a stable milk supply, it was painful at the beginning, but seeing how my daughter grows healthy and bigger everyday makes everything worthwhile~",5
"Graco Highback TurboBooster Car Seat, Spitfire","i have an older version of this booster, which is still being used by my daughter, and i got this one was for my 3-year old son, the covering is more plush and color is lovely. it is fairly inexpensive for the quality of the product.",5
The First Years Disney Pooh Soft Potty Seat,"This is great, to be able to purchase a potty seat in your childs favorite Disney Movie!!! My sister was jealous that I had one for my son, and they didn't have them back when she potty trained.  The seat is secure and seams comfortable to my little guys behind.  The pee cup keeps pee from going outside the toilet, and the rubber protectors help keep the seat stable.  Great item!!! Thanks",5
Trend Lab Blooming Baby Growth Chart Receiving Blanket in Max Stripe Frame,This blanket is too cute!  Its slightly thicker that I thought it would be so I'm not sure it's a good idea to swaddle the baby in it (which is the reason I bought it).,5
Medela Breastmilk Storage Solution,total waste of money and never really used it. plus since it is a breastfeeding product once the seal is opened it is a final sale. i recommend if you are thinking about buying this product for a new baby ...wait until the baby is a month old to buy it !!,1
North States Supergate Expandable Swing Gate,,5
"Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep","The sleep sheep is definitely soft and cuddly, but it has a huge velcro strap to velcro it to the crib rails that isn't very cuddly outside a crib. There are four different soothing sounds, one is supposed to be a heartbeat which really sounds more like the sheep has asthma, or that the sheep is creepily breathing over your sleeping infant. The other three soothing sounds are rain, which is really quite nice, the ocean- again, nice if it's not too loud and then there's the whale sounds which are up there in creep-ville with the hearbeat. The whales sound more ghostly than whale-ish, or they sound like what I imagine constipated whales to sound like. ""Ooooo-hhhhh this huuuuurrrtssss""Great for soothing the kid back to sleep with the rain or ocean sounds. But, we've been using it for about 2 months now and the sound box is broken, so I'm trying to contact the manufactuer to see if they can replace it.",3
Bee Smart Trike Zoo 3 in 1,"I'm very happy with my purchase...WOW it's all I have to say, great timing, easy to put it together. My daughter is 9 months old, and she love this! She doesn't want her stroller anymore, anytime I go for a walk with her she wants her little bicycle instead!!! THANK U SO MUCH FOR THE GREAT JOB!",5
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red",My little guy likes the blue color and enjoys biting and sucking on this teether. It's great to have when I'm out and about because it keeps him busy.,5
Stork Craft Rochester Stages Crib with Drawer,"Just don't buy this one. It's not any better than much cheaper cribs, and it's certainly not comparable to other brands in this price range. It isn't a sturdy crib, the stain rubs off, the screws don't fit properly in a lot of places, and the drop down side sticks. The drawer is completely useless. If you put anything heavier than a paper towel in it, it collapses. And if you're like me and thought investing in a hefty piece of furniture you can transition from crib to toddler bed, this is not the right choice. My daughter just transitioned to a toddler bed, and I picked up a nice sturdy one at a yardsale because at this point, the crib is toast and wouldn't survive the transition to the next stage. She's a low-key child and doesn't rough house in her bed beyond typical kicking and repositioning herself, but you can't tell that from looking at the crib. It is destroyed. When I attempted to remove the hardware to take it down, the wood actually split in several places just from moderate force in turning the screws. I wish I would have done more extensive research before I chose this crib. I could have either saved half the price in purchasing a cheaper (but sturdier) model or invested my money better in a piece that is truly sturdy and would withstand the test of time.",1
Classic Sage Lamp with Shade,I ordered this lamp late Thursday evening and it was on my doorstep Friday morning. I use it in my baby's room and it gives off just enough light that if he wakes up it's not too bright in his eyes. The quality is good and not cheap.,5
Disney Mickey Mouse and Friends 8 Piece Crib Bedding Set,This just arrived... Haven't taken it out of the package yet but it is everything that we hoped it would be.  Everything looks in good quality!,4
Mommy's Helper Car Seat Sun Shade,This is an item that everyone with a child should have. We live in AZ and my car seats have always been covered (or tried to) with the car shade screen or a towel. The shade either falls off or the towel slips and then the seat it SUPER hot and dangerous. Every mother or mother to be I run across I tell about this product and where to purchase.This product is a must have.,5
"Re-Play 3 Count Divided Plates, Pink, Green, Orange",These plates are wonderful! My kids are able to scoop the food with their spoon without it spilling over the edge. The colors are fun and love that its made of recycables.,5
"Thirsties Diaper Cover, Celery, X-Small (6-12 lbs)",I was looking for a diaper cover to use over my prefold cloth diapers.  These covers prevent leakage and I like that they are thin.  The price is also fair. If you're using flat or prefold diapers I recommend using a Snappi to keep the diaper wrapped around the baby and this cloth to prevent clothes from being soaked through.,5
Infantino Pop &amp; Play Activity Gym,"Nice and cute, the best part is that my son loves it! Very good investment, even my toddler plays with it.",5
Sesame Street Framed Friends Green Folding Travel Potty Seat,"I totally love this thing.  It folds up to a nice, easy to carry size.  It even fits in a cargo pocket.  Totally awesome product.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",Used it for 1st time today. My 5 month old seem comfortable in it. We just graduated from that 1st year tub (with sling) since he look too big for the other tub.1 less star for the scratches and dirt on the tub when it arrived. But it's good after washing. Well it's a molded plastic. Nothing fancy. Very well shaped though!,4
"Cloud b Plush Aroma Pillow Sleep Aid, Twilight Turtle","My son got this per my request for Christmas when he turned two. I wouldn't say that it really helps with his sleep, but we didn't have sleep problems in the first place. I'm a huge fan of Cloud B and this product is no exception. He still uses it and I even surface washed it yesterday with it still looking new after 7 months. I love the way he smells like lavender when he wakes in the morning!",5
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I bought these bottles for my new granddaughter and have had nothing but problems with the bottom leaking!!  She has a problem with gas and I thought these would be an improvement over the traditional bottle--no way!!  She sucked so hard on the nipples, she got a blister on her upper lip.  We discovered that part of the problem was the bottom ring was too tight, and loosing it slightly helped the baby have to suck less hard.  They worked fine when brand new, but after several uses...I have had several lapfuls of formula and she has gotten regular formula baths. We are going to a different bottle now.  I do not recommend them other than the fact they are easier to clean.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These are great bottles and a great system. We also have the 4 oz bottles, hand pump, storage system, and sippy cups. A little pricey up front but definitely worth the cost in the long run since the bottles ""grow"" with your baby. Very momma friendly!",5
Philips AVENT 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I just had a newborn and a 20 months old, so it is almost impossible to boil the water to sterlize the bottles.Finally decided to get this, and I was very exceited about it. It is very easy to operate, fits lots of bottles/pump parts, and very fast.It has some kind of odor after three uses, and it leaves some kind of smell in the bottles too.I really really want to like it since it's so fast & easy, but then I got the tommee tippee one instead coz it does the same job but does not have the odor.",3
KidCo GoPod Portable Activity Seat - Pistachio,"I got the GoPod because I saw a friends' baby playing in it and thought: This is a really cool device to keep the baby stationary and yet entertained!However... this thing seems to be HUGE - hence: Only for HUGE babies.My daughter is more on the """"tiny-baby""""-side... and she gets """"lost"""" in the GoPod. She's almost a year now and still borderline too small for it.Wish the GoPod was a little tighter.Otherwise it's a really great product!",3
Organic Pendant - Silicone Necklace (Teething/Nursing) (Peapod Green),My daughter loves playing with this teether and I attach her pacifier to the string so I don't lose it when we go out.,5
"Trend Lab Dr Seuss Storage Caddy, ABC","This is a great size caddy I plan on using it to keep with pack and play down stairs so I can have a diaper changing station on both floors. This holds plenty of diapers, powder, rash cream, etc.  It goes so well with my graco metropolis pack and play and the rest of my decor. Great for gender neutral. We don't know what we're having!",5
"ERGObaby Organic Baby Carrier, Dark Chocolate",I absolutely love my carrier! Very easy to use and comfortable. My back has no complaints and it's easy on my shoulders. I wish I had it with my previous child!,5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"I love the bottles. I really do. They are easy to clean. However, the nipples and rings seemed to have a problem with leaking out quite often. We actually replaced the nipples and rings to fix the problem.",4
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"I purchased this for my son.  He sat on it for 1 minute and complained his bottom hurt.  I put a towel around the edges to make it softer, but he still complained.  Now I'm trying to find a softer & larger portable potty.",1
SugarBooger Vroom Jumbo Splat Mat,"I viewed this purchase as somewhat of a frivolous buy given that you can really use old newspapers or drop cloth for the same purpose.  However, the mat ended up being more functional than I expected.  Adorable print aside, this mat is almost permanently under my toddler's high chair.  But I have also used it as an art mat; floor mat when we have had to go on road trips using rental cars; and a mat for when we go to the park.  It is very easy to clean (I run a vacuum and a Swiffer) and it still looks brand new.  Plus, my daughter loves pointing at the animal figures.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.",5
"Luvable Friends Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, White","The price was right for this sheet and after reading reviews, I knew it would fit the mattress I purchased for the pack and play I have! Washes up nicely, no pilling and very soft!",5
Clevamama Clevabath Mat and Kneeler,"I was very hesitant buying this but now am so glad I did. I bought this months ago and having been using it daily I will definitely recommend it my boys loved it, it doesn't move around,the kneel pad was a great addition. Very easy to wash and the quality is great no complaint.",5
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","It's true that this product does not work well if you have any beveled edges on your door frame.  It still works, but the door will open if you push hard.  The plastic was a lot flimsier than I expected.  It looks like you would break it if it was stepped on or dropped on a hard floor.  Mine has held up so far, and I like the design.  It just doesn't work well with my doors.  I wish it was more sturdy and that it would work with my door.",3
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock",Easy to use and easy to install. I suggest looking at an installation video on YouTube if you have any problems getting it into your car. We've had it installed for over a month now and our two year old loves it!Update: 8/2012 - Still going strong. I love this car seat and my daughter loves it too. I can't wait until my second child is old enough for one of her own.,5
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Bouncer, My Little Snugabunny","My parents bought this chair for their house and my infant (8 weeks old) has been loving this chair since day one!  It is so comfy and he will sleep in this for hours.  Now he is getting old enough that he loves to look at the birds.  I wish they moved in a circle like a mobile, but they still do keep his attention.  The buttons on the chair aren't that great.  The noises could stand to be louder.  But, all that said, it doesn't matter b/c he is so cozy.  I had recieved the fisher price infant to toddler rocker at my shower.  Our baby doesn't like it at all.  It isn't very comfortable as compared with this chair.  He cries after about 20 minutes, whereas he will stay in the snugabunny for hours perfectly content.  Even with the few downfalls, I give it 5 stars.  Any product that will help my baby sleep is worth it's weight in gold!",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Small, compact and easy to carry when traveling. Easy to take to restaurants. Easy to strap onto almost any chair. We have definitely gotten our use out of it and we're not finished yet. Very happy that I bought it for my grandson.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is pretty cool. I thought it would have music, because we received it as a gift, but it does not. Which turns out to be totally fine. It displays stars on the ceiling and lights up different images, if you choose. It's pretty neat and my baby seems to really like it and likes pushing the buttons. It's pretty bright so it's definitely a good night light to fall to sleep to.",5
Crochet Baby Blanket Spring Lily Pad Mat With Frog Hat Green Newborn Baby Boy Girl Photo Props 3-6 Months,This was a pleasant surprise. It arrived early than expected. Great for the price. Good fit for a new born to 3 months old. Overall very cute.,5
"Animal Puppet Bath Mitts - Set of 5 - Lady Bug, Bee, Lion, Elephant, Frog","Our three-year old twins love these bath mitts, and even though there's sometimes a fight over who gets ladybug (or lion, or froggy, or whoever the favorite is), they love them all. They've held up well over the last couple months use, and they machine wash just fine; just enough texture to scrub off dinner from faces but not so rough that the wee ones complain.",5
Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball,"We bought this toy for our 7 months old baby, and he loves it.  It is absolutely his favorite toy.  I am looking for more toys like this.  Five stars!",5
Razbaby Raz-Berry silicone Teethers Double Pack Both Colors in One Package.,"My daughter NEVER took a pacifier, but she would chew on these while teething. She is over a year old now and still likes to chew on these more than any other teether i have bought her!",5
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","I bought this for my grandson who was born in December. He seems to love it, and so does my daughter.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Even though this night isn't what I expected it to be, my daughter still loves it and uses it every night. It has three color options, red, blue, and green. The red and green are pretty much useless unless your walls are painted black. The night light features a timer, which goes off probably 15mins after being turned on. It is a disadvantage really, because sometimes it takes my daughter awhile to fall asleep and she lets me know when it goes off. Another downside is that the stars do not move.  The ladybug nightlight would be perfect if it did not shut off unless it was turned off, if the stars rotated, and if the red and green where changed to yellow and pink or other lighter colors.",3
"Bedtime Originals Jungle Buddies 3 Piece Crib Bedding Set, Brown/Yellow","I Love the set! Bright colors, good price, and adorable pattern. Just waiting to use it! (3 more months! ;)  Matches well with Jungle Jill set for those of you having boy and girls twins sharing a room!",5
Treasure Cove Pirate Window Treatment Panels by Sweet Jojo Designs - Set of 2,Great curtains with a good design. Fit well and keeps the sunlight out of all of my bedroom windows. Recommend them highly.,5
The Juppy Baby Walker (Original-No lining),"Thank you for creating the Juppy! I recently bought The Juppy as a gift for my God-Son and I couldn't be happier! It is light weight and sturdy and easy to use. We had no problems putting him in it and once we did the fun began. He had been standing on his own and now it seems he has more confidence with walking knowing one of us is right behind him. I would recommend starting your child in it early so they are used to it as they take their first steps. I had read the reviews of a similar product before deciding on the Juppy and I am glad that I did. I especially like that this product supports his whole body and his weight and that he can't fall through it. He is a very active boy and wasn't able to wiggle out of it. He loves being able to get around and follow the dogs in doors and out. I like that it is so easily adjustable as his Mommy and I are a great bit shorter than his Daddy. Years ago I worked in the infant/toddler room in a daycare and I wish we would have had a few of these on hand! When you have a few children learning to walk at the same time it puts a lot of wear and tear on your back. It would have been nice to have this so I wasn't bending over so much. It is the best gift that I have ever bought and it will now be my """"go to gift"""" for all new parents!",5
mybaby HoMedics SoundSpa On-The-Go,"The first one had to be returned because once I got it home and went to use it, I noticed one of the buttons didnt work properly. The back didn't fit properly on the next one. After the third one just not working properly, I quit trying. I really wanted this to work because it's a great concept.  Too bad it's made so cheaply!",1
SafeFit Car Seat Leveler,"My son was born 4 weeks early and was much smaller than most full term infants.  I had the hardest time riding him in my Honda Accord because of the lack of support and the angle of his carseat.  Every time I would place him in the car, his head would fall completely forward &amp; cause me to be very alarmed because he would literally appear as if his little neck was broken!  When my son was about 3 or 4 weeks old, I found this WONDERFUL leveler at Babies R Us and both of us have been much happier since!  My son, who is now 3 months old, is able to ride in the car comfortably without his head flopping around and falling forward once he goes to sleep.I did have to cut a little of the length off of the leveler so I could buckle the seat belt.I would highly recommend this product to all new parents, especially those with preemies or smaller than normal newborns.  It is an excellent investment.  Well worth the money spent!",5
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"I always take this when we go somewhere in the car, my 5 month old loves it. He can push the buttons easily and I hear him back there changing songs the whole time we are in the car. He doesn't usually like being in his car seat and this keeps him entertained and the car rides way less stressful.",5
"Babasling Lite 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Fuchsia",This is a perfect little baby carrier.  It is really soft and my niche loves to cruise in here and sleep.  It is a good blend of function and style.,5
Sunshine Kids Travel - Bag,We hauled our Britax Boulevard to Hawaii in this and it just fit. Being a huge carseat made it very heavy anyway and the addition of wheels would have been perfect. For the price I thought it was great. It held up just fine during baggage handling - we checked it of course. I imagine it would also work well for transporting portable cribs and booster seats too.,4
Fisher-Price Playful Pets Swing,"We love this swing and so does our son! It was fairly easy to assemble and isn't as bulky as the old swings I remember, but still sturdy and a lot more quiet to! I was worried when I found out it wasn't a mechanical crank type, but battery usage is suprizingly efficient, I was amazed by how long a single set of batteries lasted.Our 2 month old son actually watches the cat and dog bat the ball back and forth while laughing and talking to them and now is starting to grab for the rings at the side. He loves it and the adjustable seat, while only having three positions, seems comfortable to him and lets us recline it far enough back so that his head doesn't slump over.All in all, I have to say it's been a very worthwhile investment!",5
Beco Gemini Baby Carrier - Paige,"This is the FIFTH carrier that I tried on my baby girl that she did not get annoyed in, and did not hurt my back.I tried things like the BabyBjorn and ErgoBaby, but my baby would scream. Turns out she hated having to splay her legs so wide in these carriers - the Beco Gemini is the only carrier that lets you adjust the width of the base! It lets you do front facing, back facing, back carry and hip carry!For the first time EVER, I could get some work done between 6:30-7:30pm with her napping in the carrier against me (she used to scream and fuss during this time daily)! Now if you calculate how much the average white-collar worker is paid per hour, this is the BEST $129 ever spent!And no, I'm not affiliated with Beco - I'm just so happy!",5
NoJo Jungle Babies Lamp and Shade,This lamp matched what I was going for but it was way more expensive then it should have been.  It is a basic wood design lamp with nothing special.  Cute but not worth it.,3
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Sleeping Bag, Oh Boy, Small","These are great for summer. If you're needing them to keep your little one warm, these aren't it. Very lightweight, you can see through the fabric. Work great for our little one, and the turtles are very cute!",4
"Kiddopotamus Deluxe PiddlePad, 2 Pack","I bought this item for a toddler while potty training. If she had an accident, some still got on her car seat. It does not completely absorb and hold all the liquid. However, it stops some of the mess. I think this product would be great for a child in diapers that may occasionally  leak out into car seat. I could see it completely protecting the car seat in that situation.",3
"Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, Yellow and Orange","I can't say enough good things about this booster chair.  I have two of them, one for each of my toddlers.  My only regret is that I didn't buy this booster from the get-go and avoid the high chair completely!  I spent $90 on a Graco high chair that did not work well at all for my first child.  So, with my second child, I used this booster from the get-go when she started solids (about 5-6 months of age in our case) and it worked just fine for a baby as small as her...even better than the high chair, in fact.I love that you can put the tray very close to their body if you want to help avoid spilling down into the high chair, and you can also have the tray set back further for when they get bigger (there are three tray settings).  It's so much less bulky than a regular high chair.  It's very affordable.  And best of all...no fabric or difficult-to-clean nooks and crannies!  This chair is so easy to clean.  Both of my girls seemed plenty comfortable in it, too, despite no soft fabric on it.  In fact, they seemed much more comfy in these boosters than they did in the big padded high chair that just kind of swallowed them up when they were little.The only reason I rated this booster chair four stars instead of five is because I wish you could boost it a little bit higher.  My youngest child is 2 years old and we have the seat at the highest setting, but it's still not quite high enough to have her sit directly up to the table with us.  Yes, she is on the short side, but not THAT short.  Now that she's 2, we'd rather have her sitting right at the table with us than still sitting a little ways back from the table and using the tray on her booster.  So, now I'm in the market for a taller booster chair.  But, I have no regrets about this purchase and the Fisher Price booster has served us very well up until now.  I will certainly be using it for my next baby, too, as soon as he or she start solid foods.",4
KidCo Spring Action Cabinet Lock 4-pack,"I opted for these spring latches as opposed to the typical latch simply because they're easier for adults to operate quickly. For my drawers, I didn't even both using the catches that they provide; the hooks catch on the lips of the cabinet face just fine. The only drawback that these, along with most other drawer latches, has is that they aren't long enough to be used on the top drawer where there's an overhanging counter above it. There's not enough room to get your finger in to unlatch it.",4
"Stokke Xplory Parasol, Purple","Everything on my Stokke Xplory is so well thought through and so well designed, with the exception of this umbrella. Despite it's adjustability , I can't seem to position it so that it blocks the sun, but not my view. When I use it, as I must in the sunny summer months, I feel like i am walking blind. I can't see ahead of me to say nothing of the fact that I can't see my son. Would it have killed them to include a little window? Or better yet, perhaps they could simply design an extension to the hood so that it effectively blocked the sun and eliminate the need for the umbrella altogether.",2
Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor,"We received this monitor as a gift 7 months ago.  We requested this specific monitor as our sister-in-law has the same monitor and we loved the features.  However, the picture on the monitor is terrible!  It is constantly fuzzy and is often times hard to even see what position our child is in in the crib.  We've tried each of the suggestions given on Summer Infant's website, but nothing has improved the quality.  I wish we would have researched this product more before requesting it!",2
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Ocean Friends,"This tub is great for an infant who has outgrown the Kitchen sink tub. My six month old son loved sitting in this and splashing the water, but I noticed the bottom compartment was already deflated.  I thought maybe I didn't close the valve enough (there are two compartments you fill-the sides and also the bottom)The 2nd use is when I saw air bubbles coming from the floor, realizing there was a leak in the tub.  Very disappointing to receive a tub that was defective right away.  But for $14, I guess I couldn't expect much.  I am returning it and hoping another brand will arrive in better condition.Too bad, because other than the leak, I really liked the tub!",2
Chicco Cortina Travel System - Luna,"The Chicco Cortina Travel System was purchased from Australia for my son & daughter-in-law. They are very happy with the look of the product and can not wait to put it into full time use. My only criticism, would be that the produce does not come directly from Amazon, but another company and I was required to pay delivery. I am sad to say that it was quite excessive. In hindsight I would have still bought through Amazon, just not using this company. The ease with which a purchase can be made is wonderful. Given all that I know that the new family will get much enjoyment and ease of travel with my purchase.",4
"American Baby Company Full Size  30&quot; X  40&quot; - 100% Cotton Thermal Blanket, Blue","I've found these blankets are nice and soft for my dogs. After numerous washings, they maintained their shape and now, several months later, are still holding up well. However, they are definitely not as well made as the ones I used to use for my kids not that many years ago.",4
"Kissa's Pail Liner, White","Have been using these for 2 weeks, and find them an easy solution to the pail challenges of the past. They machine wash, and dry, along the diapers, and don't seem to stain or carry odors. Hang dry takes overnight. Craftsmanship looks good. No complaints and frankly at this price, given the job they are doing, I will be willing to replace them if they start to wear out!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We bought several of these for Christmas and birthday presents, kids of all ages love turning their rooms into the open sky. Durable, cute animals - we had to buy one of our nephews a backpack for his turtle because he refuses to go anywhere without it.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Easy to use, I thought I received a defective item at first cause the door did not meet to close.  If you read the instructions once you place it and tighten in the door way the door will meet and lock in place just fine.  I bought this so I can contain my dog with out crating while I am busy or away.",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Dome Caps,My husband lost one of my baby's caps so I was happy to be able to buy some without having to buy new bottles!,4
"Nuby Click-it No-Spill Easy Grip, 6+ Months 10 oz (300 ml) Beginners Sippy Cup with a Soft Silicone Spout, Step 2 (Red)","MY DAUGHTER'S favorite sippy due to its easy to hold design and bright, fun colors.  MY FAVORITE because there are no spills or messes to clean up, and the cup is super easy to clean.  Excellent job, Nuby! :)",5
Long-Range Vibrating Baby Monitor,"This monitor worked really well for about six months. I could hear my daughter breathing, I could hear traffic go by outside her window, and I could hear the echo of my husband and I laughing from our living room! It was great because it made me feel really safe - but after about siz months, I was unable to unplug it. If I wanted to take it to another room with me, as soon as I would unplug it, it would stop working. if you slammed it with the palm of your hand, the sound would come in and out... Now it doesn't even do that. If I dont' have this thing plugged it, it does not work. So, I am not able to leave the room that I am plugged into. Which pretty much defeats the whole purpose of having a baby monitor with such a wide range and rechargeable batteries. This thing is pretty much worthless to me now. I'm shopping around for a new one that will allow me to actually walk around my house. I'm very disappointed because I can't get my money back on this junk.",2
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Bouncer, My Little Snugabunny",Great seat! My five week old son absolutely loves this chair. It's super cozy and comforting for him. We have the swing as well but he prefers the bouncer. Would definitely recommend!,5
"The Safe Sporter Water Bottle, Blue, 16 Ounce","I would skip purchasing this cup. The lid is very difficult to snap completely shut. Plus with the single-wall insulation, this cup is not a great buy",1
"Philips Avent 10 Pack BPA Free Breast Milk Storage Starter Set, Clear, 6 Ounce",EXCELENTE...,5
Elegant Baby Pearl Earrings,These earrings are absolutely gorgeous. Right size for a small baby's earring or 2nd (or 3rd) earring holes.My then 10mth old daughter used these for 5 months until she figured out how to unscrew them. She is that good :( SO now she is wearing hoops that are difficult to unlatch.I will be using these earrings for my secondary earring holes now,4
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","It's easy to cling onto the glass and of high efficiency in shading sunshine.And is easy to carry,I am satisfied with it.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"This is a great little potty chair that I use for traveling with my little girl.  It's small so it does not take up much room in the car. But because it is small and light, you have to watch out when your little one gets up.  Make sure they are not stuck to it or you will have to clean up a big mess.  Otherwise, it is great and easy to clean.",4
Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set,"I (or I should say, my boy) like(s) Dr. Brown's Natural Flow bottles very much. This set comes with only two levels of nipples (level one and level two). As the child grows bigger, the nipples needs to be changed. There are five levels (Preemie, One, Two, Three, and Four) of nipples and a ""Y-cut"" nipple. The higher the level of the nipple, the faster the flow. If the baby refuse the bottle, there is a possiblity that the nipple is either a level too high or too low. Just need to pay attention to this, and you won't have problems with these bottles.Well of course these bottles takes more time to wash, but as long as the baby feels good, it will actually save time (hay, just feed him/her and he/she's happy and go directly to sleep).",5
"Babymel BM901 Cross Body,Navy Stripe,One Size","This really is a very stylish bag. I had high hopes because it's a good size but doesn't scream ""MOM"" like a conventional diaper bag.However, this bag could not have possibly been designed by a mom. It has two main pockets, both of which are the full depth of the bag, 18.5 inches deep. You basically have to stack items on top of each other to fit everything. I don't mind that so much as long as I have smaller pockets for smaller items like gas drops, or baby Tylenol. There are two pockets (only two) inside the main body of the bag but they go all the way to the bottom, again, 18.5 inches. Anything I put in them is instantly lost. To fully utilize the pocket, I just have to stack things on top of each other which makes for a rough few minutes of digging while my baby is impatiently waiting (screaming). It just doesn't make sense. Why not four stacked pockets instead of two long ones? Why not extra pockets or pouches in the other large compartment?Kudos for the built in insulated bottle pouch on the outside of the bag and I do love love love the outer fabric and print. Really chic and casual looking in navy or red. It also has a great overall shape. Like a messenger bag with a twist. I also liked that it had two main but separate sides of the body.But why no cute lining? Would it have been so impossibly hard to put a bright blue, green, or pink lining instead of boring mom beige?? The lining was not a deal breaker, though, as I'm sure some moms prefer the simplicity of beige.Long story short, I really wanted this bag to work. Had the organization been more realistic for a mom carrying small things for their small person, I'm sure it would have. But struggling to find my car keys, or the paci in it was just a nightmare. I had to return it. :o(",2
Pack and Play Netting,"We love camping-- so this bug net was great for keeping over the pack and play while she slept, and also great for covering the stroller while out on walks in the woods. It's such a low price, absolutely worth it.",5
"The First Years Straw Cup, Take and Toss, 10 Ounce,, 8-Count",Great cups perfect for toddlers. These are better than the same cups with the sippy spouts. The straws will wear out quickly if you have a child who likes to bite them but the straw holes are perfect size for flexible disposable straws.,5
Eddie Bauer Deluxe Convertible Car Seat,"We searched high and low to find a convertible car seat for my 7 month old son.  He's already over 20 pounds but can't face forward for another 5 months - so all those other car seats that only hold 40 pounds total were going to be a waste of money for us. This seat holds 80 pounds total, so this is one baby item he won't be growing out of so soon!  Parents - please remember that your baby needs to face backwards until they are at least 20 pounds AND over 1 year old!The seat itself was a breeze to put together.  It went from box to back seat in about 20 minutes.  It comes completely put together except that you have to adjust the shoulder straps to the height of your baby.  The first time we put my wiggly little guy in the seat, everything clipped together like a charm.  No pinched fingers, no digging for straps under his legs, no frustrated Mommy or Baby.The seat fits nicely with room to spare in our mini-suv.  We could even move the passenger seat back a little from where the seat had to be for the baby car seat we just replaced.  And speaking of - this car seat IS NOT for newborn babies.  If you are buying your baby's first car seat - buy a baby seat.  These convertible car seats are for infants and toddlers NOT little babies - and once you start shopping around for anything from toys to books to clothes you will know there is a big difference between babies and infants.This chair sits up straighter than a baby seat.  My little boy was tired of laying down in his baby seat by the time he hit the 20 pound limit, so the new sitting position in this seat is much better.  However, if your child can't hold their own head up or tip up their own bottle or sippy cup, they won't be able to give themselves a drink. Speaking of - the entire top cover comes off EASILY and you can throw it in the washing machine!  With or without mashed-in bananas and cheerios and milk!Also - when your little one does fall asleep in this chair - have a pillow or a rolled up blanket to catch their necks.  Their heads will tilt down if you don't. That's gravity's fault - not the chair's.Basically, if you have a little one who likes to sit up and look out the window or amuse themselves in the back seat - this car seat is perfect.  Comfortable, affordable, SAFE, and easy to use.  It's the same amount of quality you'd expect from any Eddie Bauer product and I highly recommend it.",5
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue","Baby washcloths are one of those items you'd be tempted to skip, but these have turned out to be quite useful, though they're certainly not a necessity.  Regular washcloths are just a bit too large and coarse for a little baby.  We use these to wash our little one's face and hands after meals and at bath time.  These aren't super high quality - just small flimsy cloths, but that's just the ticket.  I wouldn't want something thicker.  One side is rougher than the other and works well for rubbing off food.  For ten dollars, this was a good purchase.  We use these wash cloths daily.",5
Fisher-Price EZ Bundle 4-in-1 Baby System,Good price for what you can use it for.  Not using it as a infant seat.  She loves the swing.  Arrived on time.,4
Paci-Plushies Buddies - Patches Puppy Pacifier Holder,"My 1 year old was waking multiple times a night crying because his pacifier would fall out of his mouth while he was sleeping and he either a) couldn't find it (even though we used glow in the dark pacifiers) or b) it would fall through the slats and be unreachable.  We tried everything including throwing as many as 5 pacifiers into the crib at bedtime hoping he might stop crying and waking us throughout the night. Finally, at his 1 year check up, his pediatrician asked how he was sleeping and I explained our predicament.  She suggested an item like this.  I got online and researched and this one was cute and would allow me to use his favorite pacis by Mam, but would also work with avent ones we have.When it first arrived, I attached a Mam pacifier to it and gave it to him.  He spent a little while trying to get the puppy off of the pacifier, but then gave in and put it in his mouth.  Even though we usually reserve the pacifier for bedtime and naps,  I let him use it for 3 days off and on throughout the day to get it so he would associate the plushy puppy with his pacifier.  A week later, we were sleeping through the night for the first time in a year!!  He is able to find the pacifier more easily and it is less likely to slip through the slats.  It also seems to be a soothing thing for him to hold the pup when he gets upset.  I am ordering a 2nd one as a back up.",5
"Tadpoles 16 Sq Ft Pawprint Playmat Set, Brown",My husband and I bought these mats after we adopted our three-legged puppy. She was having a hard time getting around on the slick wooden floors in our house and we thought these would be a great alternative to buying a bunch of rugs.She runs and plays on them regularly when she's inside and they seem to be pretty durable. They don't slide around too much and the pieces stay in place. She naps on them for extended periods of time and the padding seems to do a fair job against making her stiff from sleeping on the hard floor (though she prefers her doggie bed).Would recommend!,5
"Joovy Kooper Umbrella Stroller, Yellow","I just received this stroller today and I am in love with it. I have a Maclaren umbrella stroller, which I loved everything about, except it wouldn't let my 2 1/2 year old 29 lbs. ""baby"" girl recline at all when napping. She always looked uncomfortable in it. Although it handles like a dream.When I was looking at this stroller I found it had everything I was looking for. It reclines pretty much all the way down for her to lay back & take a nap when shopping. The basket is of good size & it handles also like a dream. Also with the (always there) sunshine here in Florida the canopy is wonderful! It seems to shade her eyes & entire body from the sun.We are going up north traveling in a few weeks & am I certainly bringing this stroller as oppose to my other 4. It will certainly fit through the X-ray machine no problem, but I will be buying the travel bag to gate check it in, hoping to protect my favorite stroller so far. I just wish I would have found this 2 1/2 years ago when my not so much anymore ""baby"" girl was little, and maybe I wouldn't have 4 other strollers in the garage like I do now!",5

Happy Heinys ONE for ALL One Size Cloth Diaper with Snap Closure + 2 Microfiber Inserts (Aqua),"This diaper rocks. Never have had a leak!

Fisher-Price Table Time Turtle Booster,This simple seat was easy to install and clean at a good price.  As an added bonus our son enjoys the fact that it is a turtle.  It attaches very securely to the seat and it is easy to clip him in and out.  It stays quite stable even when he's decided to reach way off to the sides or lean over the edge to see what's going on down on the floor under his chair.,5
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"It would be perfect if the camera could also be used unplugged, just like the monitor, with a battery.",4
"Mam Nipples Slow Flow, 0+ months, 2 pack","I have been through several different brands of bottles and nipples: Dr. Brown's, Tommy Tippee, Madela, Advent, and a few more.  My son, who has a mild hypotonia in the mouth, didn't like any of them and always had leakage.  The MAM bottle and nipples were a Godsend. No leakage and he really likes them.",5
"Safety 1st onBoard 35 Infant Car Seat, Orion Pink","This car seat seams safe enough but it's not as user friendly as I'd like.  Here are my thoughts:Pros:Price (cheaper than many brands)Fabric (easy to clean, like the pattern)Size (will last baby longer than smaller carrier carseats that only go 22 or 30 pounds)Weight (isn't any heavier than my 22 pound carrier)Made in USA (I was excited when I found this out and it helped me make my decision on which seat to buy)Cons:Straps are extremely difficult to tighten enough for me to feel that my baby is safe.  They tighten so far and then they pretty much stop (my baby is 20 pounds so he's not too small for it).Base and carseat don't fit together well and don't make a clicking noise when they do lock.  You have to be careful to make sure that the seat is locked into the base each time.  My previous carrier carseat was not like this and I heard a click every time.Overall, I would neither recommend this to a friend nor recommend that they avoid this product.  It's fine and it will do the job but I liked my old carseat better.  It was a Graco Snugride (22 pounds) that I got as a shower gift and I wish I would have exchanged it for a Graco 35 to begin with so that I would have a better quality carrier that would work longer for my baby.",3
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small",Love this bag. It works great as discribed! I need to get a second one to keep in the diaper bag.,5
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"Not only is this item expensive, it does not warm wipes effectively either. I owned this product and then switched to the ""Munchkin"" wipes warmer. The reason it is expensive is because you cannot use it on it's own; you have to buy Lionheart replacement pillows which are unnecessary. You can pay as much as $12.00 for a pair, which have to be replaced every 3 months. However, the reason why the Lionheart warmer cannot warm properly is because it does not have a seal. Therefore, it does not lock any of the heat and moisture created. On the other hand for example, the Munchkin warmer which I own now, has two locks on each side which seals warm air/moisture. Also, it just requires 1/2 cup of water with each set of wipe addition.Even if the Lionheart warmer was locked, it would still be an OK product since you would still have to purchase the replacement pillows...",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I absolutely love this bathtub.  I used the sling when my daughter couldn't sit up and now she sits in the ring part of the tub.  It is a perfect size for an infant.  My daughter is 8 months old and I think she'll be able to use this tub for a few more months.,5
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,"These latches are very easy to install and very effective for keeping out 1-year old out of the bathroom cabinets. In one area, I used a single latch installed at an angle to prevent our kiddo from opening both a cabinet door and the sliding drawer above it. So far, he hasn't managed to get any of the cabinets/drawers open. I highly recommend.",5
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"This was a gift and in shopping for a pack-n-play, it seemed the best value for the price.",5
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,It was able to adjust perfectly for my kids' tub and so far it has been sturdy. Would recommend it.,5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I was very excited when the product arrived, and pleased that it came with a removable cover so I didn't have to buy one separate to wash.  The positioning of the pillow DOES make it more comfortable to sleep...some of the time.  I did like the &#34;curl&#34; around the top, and that I could position part of the pillow between my knees, the filling is really not all that comfortable though (I am used to sleeping on a memory foam pillow).  I went from using a blanket at night, to just covering myself with a sheet because I would heat up quickly with this pillow around me.  Whenever I wanted to roll to another side, it became quite a chore to move the entire pillow around my body while changing my position.  Some nights I would kick it out of bed before morning rather than struggle with moving it.It's great if you need extra heat and don't move a lot when you're sleeping.  I think the filling should be a little better quality for the price they're charging though.",3
"Bumbleride Indie Stroller, Aqua","We did SO MUCH research on strollers before our baby came -  going online, going to baby fairs, going to stores - and after seeing, reading about and test driving (walking?) many strollers, we always came back to the Bumbleride. It's got a smaller footprint than the Bob and is lighter than the Bob, which was a factor in us buying this. The only difference and minor setback is that it isn't rated for weight over something like 25 or 28 pounds, whereas the Bob is. But by the time our daughter is that big, well, we'll cross that bridge when we arrive. But anyway! Very good quality, very easy for my wife - she's 5'7&#34; - to get it in and out of the car, and the other thing we like bout it is that it's got a &#34;springy&#34; feeling when going over rough terrain - like grass, dirt, rocks - that make it more &#34;trail&#34; friendly than any of the other strollers we looked at. So if you like to hike, I do recommend this stroller. And also - the company is very good to work with. Definitely register the stroller after you buy it.",5

"Dreambaby Stroller Fan, White/Blue",I wanted to keep my baby cool this summer and this fan is perfect for the stroller. It's nice that the blades are soft if you accidentally touch them.,5
Fisher-Price Private Connection Monitor,We've been using the monitor for a couple months and have found it to be an average product.  My main problem is the receiever isn't very sensitive.  You have to turn the volume way up in order to hear sounds in the baby's room.  But the more you turn up the volume the more static you hear.  So every night before bed we adjust the volume to be low enough that the static doesn't keep us awake and high enough that we actually hear the baby when she makes noise.  It's annoying.  We had a Sony monitor that had a feature where it only made noise when the baby made noise - otherwise it was totally silent.  I wish all monitors had that feature.,3
"green sprouts Baby Food Mill, Green","I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend having her first baby.  Since they don't make the brand I used and loved as a young mom, I chose it based on the reviews.  I'm sure the item is fine, but the packaging for the product was all beat up and torn!  Not much fun to give as a gift!  :(",3

"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue",I purchased this for my daughter-in-law because she has bad knees and to provide more comfort when she washes her new born baby. She really loves it and said it does not hurt her knees when she bends down. My son also loves it as well. They like the pouches where you do not have to reach far to gather the bathing accessories.,5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",I bought this for my grandbaby for Christmas. She loves it and my daughter kept saying it was such a neat toy.,5
Bella Tunno Pacifier Clip Keeper with NEW Loop Binker That Is Compatible with Any Pacifer. (Cocoa Dots / Cocoa Zebra),"Another dummy here, did not read the review and was perplexed to receive only one clip. It's a cute clip, but not worth the price. I would've bought a different product if I had known that there's only one clip.",1
"Sassy Soft Swimmers Animal Characters Bath Toy, 3 Pack",These are cute and soft and bigger than I expected them to be. Nice alternative to sucking the water out of the washcloth while we're trying to scrub!,5
North States Pressure Mount Diamond Mesh Wood Gate,No need for fancier gates unless you have stairs involved. I would NOT use this near stairs but anywhere else it is fine and easy to step over. Wood is nice when my girl stands there and chews on it - better than painted metal. Don't get the plastic ones.,4
Under The Nile Green Bean Toy,"MY son LOVED this carrot.  His first favorite was the green bean, but when he lost that the carrot was a quick replacement.  He loved to hold and suck and chew on it.  It lasted a long time and through a lot of teething.  I love that it is organic and the dye is safe.  I never had concerns letting his chew on it.  When it got thrown-up on, I tossed it in the wash and it came out good as new.",5
"Safety 1st Complete Air Protect 65 Convertible Car Seat, Great Lakes",I bought one just like this in brown/orange colors about 2 years ago for my older son. Worked so well and is so durable that I bought one for my second son!,5
"Bumkins Waterproof Zippered Wet/Dry Bag, Blue Owl","My 11-month old son has been using cloth diapers since birth and during that time our household has amassed a collection of wet bags. The Bumkins Waterproof bag has quickly become one of my wife's favorites because of its features, size and versatility.--------------------DESIGN:First, this bag is quite large. At 12.6 x 16.1 inches this is a bag capable of holding an entire days worth of dirty diapers with room to spare. Depending on your situation this may be a good or bad thing. For my son who goes to a Nanny daily this bag is perfect! In an 8-9 hour span we can usually expect he'll dirty 5-6 diapers. This bag can not only easily accommodate 5-6 large Bum-Genius diapers but does so without any leaks and does an excellent job containing smells as well.We find that by folding the Bumkins bag carefully and letting trapped air out that we can easily fit the bag in our medium-sized diaper bag as well.Additional features include a sewn-in button release tab that makes it easy to hand the bag from stroller handles, cribs, etc. The bag has a zippered outer compartment that's separate from the inner compartment that serves to separate wet items from dry.We opted for the owl motif which fits in nicely with our son's owl themed room.High marks for a sturdy, well sewn construction as well.--------------------WHAT I LIKE:(+) Perfect for holding an entire day's worth of dirty diapers(+) No leaks!(+) Construction and materials are excellent(+) The pattern is bright, colorful, and fun--------------------WHAT I DON'T LIKE:(-) For quick outings with the baby this bag may be overkill because of the size--------------------CONCLUSION:The Bumkins zippered waterproof bag is well built, features excellent materials and construction and is easy to recommend.",5
Lily's Home Starry Night Projector and Sound Shooter. With 6 Lullabies and 4 Nature Sounds. Large LCD Alarm Clock,I like this dream light as my girls call it because it has more than one song plus sounds and the best part is that you can set it to turn off after 10 min. or you can chose to set it at other times too.,4
*SPECIAL PROMOTION*The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Honey - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),"After finding out my son was biting anyone and everything he could get his hands (mouth) on at daycare, I had a long discussion with his lead teacher and she mentioned the possibility of amber beads being of some help. I immediately ordered these and have been pleased so far. While I am not against medication for teething pain, my son is my fifth child and I'm always willing to try new things! So far so good:  no more biting at school. Maybe it's the teething tablets but maybe it's the amber beads. They certainly can't hurt, right?",5
"Think King Soft Buggy Cup for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker,  Black/Silver","Bought this to put on my walker.  It doesn't stay put and I end up spilling my bevvie allll the time.  It bumps onto clothing racks, etc. and forces the cup holder to flip, upside down.  Sorry I bought it.  It is NOT universal.",2
"Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green","we use a mix of glass and plastic bottles, and this accommodates everything.  my husband likes the way it looks in our kitchen so much he wants to buy another one, and replace the bottle rack we purchased previously.  we now buy this for all of our friends having babies.",5

#70 Preppy Pink argyle baby leg warmers by My Little Legs,"I ordered these little leg warmers in about six different patterns, and I'll probably get more.  They're absolutely perfect: they're big enough that they'll fit my daughter for a while, but they stay on her legs even now (she started wearing them at about six weeks old - they're big, but they stay on as long as she's wearing socks). They're toasty enough to substitute for pants, and you don't need to pull pants off to change diapers - just pull them down slightly to get them out of the way. And they're completely adorable. We always get many, many compliments on them when she shows them off.  They make a great gift, too.",5
"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","I have the Chicco Keyfit 30 in Romantic, and there is a lot of good but the few bad things are deal breakers.Good:-car seat is very easy to install, and easy to make sure it's right (leveling bubbles are easy indicators)-seat pops in and out with ease-seems to be made wellBad:-I was very surprised at how heavy the seat is to carry with baby in tow. I am no wimp, and from day 1, I had a hard time. now that my baby is 16 lbs, it's almost impossible for me to walk with her more than a few feet. Perhaps this is necessary to keep the seat safe. If so, then so be it!-Hot! Hot! Hot! my daughter cries her eyes out as soon as she starts heating up- and that's usually within 5 minutes. If I keep her in the seat (ex- if I take her food shopping), the poor baby wiggles and arches her back the whole time. when i take her out of the car seat, her back and back of her head is drenched in sweat. no, i do not over dress her and no, the sun is not beating on her. she's fine until she starts getting heated up. it's making traveling with her very difficult. i can not wait to purchase the next stage car seat. perhaps this is what every parent goes through? i wouldnt know, i'm just sure that the material is making our lives miserable.-i've noticed that some Graco seats have a deep groove on the underside. this is great for seating the car seat in the top portion of the shopping car. this seat does not have this!! i am forced to put the car seat in the large part of a shopping cart. this leaves almost no room for grocery shopping, or diaper shopping. it's made things very tough! i can not take her along with me when i have to get things done. next time, i will look for this feature when purchasing the infant seat.",3

"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn",My son loves his swaddle and sleeps in it all the time.  It is super warm/comfy and easy to wrap him in.  It is a bit big but he'll grow into it and it's fairly easy to adjust the size/fit.,4
"Graco SimpleSwitch Highchair and Booster, Pasadena","This highchair met all the standards I was looking for. I was wanting a light weight high/booster chair that had a full harness for the child sitting in it. Most children highchair age do not like to sit still and a lap belt just does not hold them in place for long. I would not take the chance of having to step away for a moment and have the child take a dive. Chair legs positioned so the chair won't tip over was also a big concern. safety of my grandchildren is very important to me. The only 2 things I don't like about the chair. One is that it is hard to move once the child is in the chair. I wish I had gotten the one with wheels on back legs. Two, the tray isn't as easy to use one handed as they claimed, maybe it just takes practice in use looses it up. All in all for the money I'm very happy with the chair and think it will work very nicely for our family for years to come.",5
Spectra Dew 350 Advanced Double Electric Hospital Grade Breast Pump with Tote!,"Having been using my medela on full suction and still not being efficient enough while pumping I decided to order the Dew upon reading its reviews.. Well it got here today and its amazing, the suction force is so strong and effective I have to use it on half stregnth. This pump makes medela look bad. So happy I purchased it!!",5
"The First Years Spinning Drying Rack, White","For the price, it is a good thing to buy! It's very easy to set up too. But for the first three months, I still Suggest to get the steam one. That would be much better and much clean.",4
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Cradle 'n Swing, Rainforest Friends","My daughter, who is now 3, did not like swings so I gave away her swing when she was about a month old. My son loves to be rocked or walked around and it was getting exhausting... I just bought this FP swing for my 1 month old son. I bought it in a store because I couldn't wait the two days for my prime shipping. I assembled it in about 15 mins (the time it took to wash the seating), nursed my son (while the seating was in the dryer) and when he was ready to go back to sleep, I put him in it and presto... He is asleep in the swing!!!I found the directions easy to follow for assembling. The packaging was a little flimsy and when you move the box around, the parts clinked together. But the ends of the metal pieces had cardboard with tape (which wasn't a hassle to remove). I did assemble the legs wrong at first but quickly corrected my mistake. I love that I can plug it in... I hate buying and replacing batteries every few days... If you think about it, the amount of money spent on batteries can easily justify the purchase of a good swing with AC adapter.I am so happy that I can use the time it took to get him to sleep and do something else or spend more time solely with my daughter (especially while she adjusts to her brother). So far, I am recommending this swing to my friends!",4
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","It was not for us, but our Son, and they are very pleased. It makes their life easier, now they can do other things while holding the baby. Thank you very much.",5
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler",My 2 year old keeps using it just because he wants to do whatever his little sister is doing.Still working after 7 months.,5
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"I have used this product for several months now and love it! The monitors are very sensitive so I never have to worry about not being able to hear what is going on in my baby's room, but I also have the wonderful option of turning the sound down and just watching the lighted face if I need to. The dual monitors are also a must as I keep one upstairs and downstairs. Overall, this has been a great product!",5
"The First Years True Fit Convertible Car Seat, Monet",I have 2 C630s for over a year. I just bought a C670. I had to replace one of the ones I had because we were involved in an accident. Our son was so comfortable and safe in his seat during the whole ordeal that when insurance ask me to replace the seat it was a no brainer to get another True Fit. Thanks for a great product.,5
Prince lionheart Ever-Fresh Replacement Pillow,I bought this for my daughter for my granddaughter and love it! Never even knew they made wipe warmers but living in cold weather that last thing you want is a cold wipe on your baby's bum!! Highly recommend it!!,5
"Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Black","Great, small, practical diaper bag.  It's nice for day outings, but a little small for longer trips.  I wish I had ordered one with a top zieer though, since stuff can fall out if tipped...",4
Set of 12 Baby Boy Rubber Duckys (Assortment),We used these as part of the decorations for a baby shower.  They were very cute and the 3 and 4 year olds who visited later loved them!,4
Fisher-Price Calming Waters Vibration Bathing Tub,He seems to really relax while in the tub. He is calm while drying and dressing him after a soak.  He usually goes to sleep after bath time.  Would make a great shower gift.,5
"Eddie Bauer Harness Buddy, Monkey","My daughter just loves her harness.  She thinks we are playing dress-up when she puts it on and pretends she's a puppy.  Some people have even stopped us to see what brand it was.  They really think it is discreet.  I no longer have to run after her in the shopping mall or in the parking lot.  Finally, we are both enjoying our outings together and she is finally safe!",5
"Munchkin Baby Food Grinder, Light Blue",I have had this food mill for awhile and I have had no luck with getting it to work.  When I use it I get (maybe)a couple of teaspoons of ground food after a lot of frustration in trying to get it to work.  I mainly try to used it with meat that is often difficult for my little one to chew.-It leaks-It always leave about 1 inch of food that doesn't get ground-Metal residue is left on the foodI have even had others try it to see if they can get it to perform better with no luck at all.I would not recommend this product to anyone.,1
"Skip Hop Pronto Changer Diaper Bag, Black",Great design.  We use it all the time.  Only problem is that one of the zippers broke after a few months of use.,3
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","Good small bag for wet clothes and bibs.  Will easily fit one small outfit, burp cloth, or nappy.  Best for short trips.  Cute fabric, easy to wash.",5
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,These pouches were perfect to use for my 8 month old.  I like to make my own baby food but it was getting tricky to feed her since she wanted to feed herself.  These pouches make it possible to take our homemade baby food on the road.  They are easy to fill and I have put them through the dishwasher a few times with no problems.,5

Philips AVENT Twin Pack Nipplette,"great product, definitely works",5
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"We purchased two umbrella strollers for our twins as ""emergency stroller"", and we got those connectors as well, of course.I can only say that it has saved our lives many times. One time (3 years ago), our main stroller was broken, and we had to wait for the replacement. Since we did not want to spend a lot of money, this was the option we chose.The connectors are cheap, and still extremely good. We have used them for over 3 years now, and even when they fell apart once, they still got back together with no effort and it still works all in all. The middle wheels of the strollers get stuck sometime, since they are apparently too close together. But, I figured my way out and I am very happy with this.We traveled overseas with the twins when they were 3 1/2 years of age. I was so uncertain whether to take a stroller or not, that still fits into the car after arrival at the new place. I thought ""alright, let's take the buggies. if something breaks or falls apart, it won't hurt."" It turned out all well and fine, and the stroller extremely necessary for the unexpected things happening at airports. We had to walk long ways, incl move of Gate at the last minute to the other side of the airport.Although I write a lot not too important for the connectors, I still hope to give some advice, especially twin parents. Even if not used as emergency stroller, this option can be used on a daily basis for shorter slow strolls.Super invention, and I am glad that there is something out there that allows low-income families to ""survive"". Great invention of our times!",5
Sassy Talk and Touch Barn Activity Center,"I got this toy when my daughter was about 11 or 12 months old. I have to say that she absolutley loves this toy then and now. The problem is that there are a couple buttons that trip her up. There's a toggle to flip for a horse and a lever to pull down for a cow and they're extremely hard to push over and pull down. She always gets frustrated when trying to do these two animal's levers and I end up having to help her. She's now 19 months old and still is having problems with the horse lever and can just barely get the cow lever down half the time. And I'd like to make it known that she's not a weak child! Still, she likes this toy. Just don't expect a 9 month old to pull all the toggles themselves. This maker should've made these easier to manipulate. Or maybe I just got a defective one:-) I'd be my luck.",3
Happy Wrap Baby Organic Bamboo Carrier - Slate,"I purchased this after reading reviews that the fabric breathes well and is stretchy. I have a back/front facing carrier I will use when my baby is a little older, but I wanted something more portable (this comes in a small knit bag) and easy to use (not lots of straps and buckles) that a newborn fits in. It only took me a couple of times looking in the mirror to get the wrapping right. Now I can put it on in a couple of minutes and I use it all the time. My 3 month old sleeps well in it and it's great for outings or to just wear around home while I cook or clean or need my hands free. I have only used it in the newborn position, but I'm sure it will still be useful as my baby grows. It is a lot of fabric that has to be wrapped and tied a lot, but I get a lot of comments about how useful it looks, what an ingenious carrier,  or how they wish they'd had one when they had babies, etc. so the small learning curve is totally worth it. I used credit card points that apply to my purchase so I didn't pay full price which made it even more worth the purchase as I think the price is a little high. My two cents.",5
Baby Bunny Bunting Gown Set (Small Preemie for Babies 3-6 Pounds),We purchased this for our new grandson for Easter. He's a preemie so he was still in the hospital when the outfit arrived. All the other parents & nurses were in awe when we dressed him in this outfit. The quality is top notch and the stitching of the carrots is flawless!,5
Mod Stripes Aqua/choc 10CS,"I have not actually used this bedding set yet because we do not have the crib set up due to our living situations (hence only four stars), but after taking out of the packaging it seems to be good quality. I am not quite sure I will use the mobile or the wall hangings, but they are a nice addition if I do choose to. Why I really wanted to do this review though is because I was a little surprised to notice that there is a grid on the side that has diamonds. I can tell looking at the pictures now and knowing that they are there, but could not before I saw it in person. Thin blue lines connect each point of the diamonds to one another. It doesn't make a difference to me, but it may to someone else.",4
Summer Infant Rite Temp Baby Bath Shower,"Our 6 month-old loves showers: it is like ""rain"" and she tries to catch it. Unfortunately our bathtub doesn't come with one.This item is a really good idea because it gives you an average temperature of the water and can hold a good amount of it.The problem is that you need to hold the button pretty hard to get the water and then the pressure is really really low... So it is a bit difficult to rinse my daughter.Actually, I stopped using it as a shower and it became a bucket that holds clean water to rinse her after her bath: it is now not a cheap bucket...",2
Built NY Double Thirsty ToteLeaf Green/Lagoon Blue,I love this bottle holder for glass bottles. It has great knit facing with neoprene fabric. Convenient snap loop for attaching to stroller.,5
babyletto Modo 5-Drawer Dresser in Espresso/White,"This dresser arrived quickly after I ordered it and it is a very attractive addition to my baby's nursery.  I love it because of it's rich color, modern elegance, and for the fact that it doesn't look like baby furniture so we will get many years of use out of it.  The only disappointing aspects of it are that the paint chips easily (which can be easily corrected with a brown marker or dark-colored furniture touch-up pen) and that one of the drawer sides arrived broken in half.  My husband had to glue it back together since we waited until the last minute to put it together and couldn't afford to wait for a replacement part to arrive.  The drawer is working fine, but it was disappointing to pay that much and have a broken part.  Bottom line:  I'd buy this piece again in a second, but would open the box immediately so I could determine if anything was broken or missing.",4
"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss Wall Clock, ABC",This clock is adorable. It seems well made and looks great in the baby's room. It is colorful and eye catching for little ones.'I would recommend purchasing if you like it.,5

"Graco Safe Seat Infant Car Seat, Ionic","I read the reviews before I bought this product and I am glad I did. It was exactly what I needed. However, my daughter will outgrow this seat before long. Be mindful if you are having a big baby. My bundle of joy was 9 lbs, 12 ounces and I will be needing to get a new seat very soon. Otherwise, great product!",4
"Boppy Changing Pad Cover with Waterproof Liner, Blue",I love this changeing pad cover.  It is so soft and the color is just like in the picture.  It fits in with my nursery very well.  Plus I love how it comes with the insert that can be easily washed.  They even sell a three pack of the white part now.  I bought those as well and fit just the same as the one that came with it.  This is a great buy!,5
Graco Imonitor Vibe Digital Baby Monitor-2 Parent units,For $125 cant you provide a better picture so i can see what it is i'm buying? i mean really. Are power adapters included. If so how many?. Anything else included? How about INCLUDING THEM IN THE PICTURE AS WELL. A picture is worth....Finish this sentence for yourself. thanks,2
"Colgate Classica I Foam Crib Mattress, White","I was very concerned about SIDs and wanted a very firm mattress for my newborn.  When this mattress arrived, I was concerned that it might be too firm -- it doesn't have a lot of give at all.  However, my 3 month old baby doesn't seem to mind and sleeps through night on it for four weeks now and also takes her naps on it since she was a month old (we had her sleeping in our room at night for the first couple of months).  Also, I feel great that I don't have to worry at all that the mattress might be too soft.The fact that this mattress is so lightweight has been a huge bonus for me.  It makes changing crib sheets and crib pads much easier.",5
"Baden Blankyball Basketball, Blue",I ordered this for a friend's newborn and she loved it! It's soft and safe for him to play with. It's his first ball. :),5
"Carters Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover, Chocolate","I love this changing table cover, it is so soft and comfortable. It has been washed numerous times already and still looks great. It stretches perfectly to fit over the pad and stays snug enough to not move excessively. The color is great too since it doesn't show stains like light colors.",5
"green sprouts Water Bottle Cap Adapter Set, Clear",I bought these to try since I like the Gerber bottle spouts so much.  I had the same problem as other consumers; the nipple collapsed allowing no water to come through and my toddler handed the water bottle back to me with a puzzled look on his face.  I threw it away.,1
Britax B-Agile Stroller Travel Bag,"Recommend this bag to any Britax stroller owners. perfect bag for your stroller, I already washed it in delicate cycle and layed flat to dry and it looks like new",5
OsoCozy Birdseye Flat Cloth Diapers - 27x27 inches (dozen),These were my first flat purchase. I looked all over the web for a good price on osocozy flats and these were by FAR the best price I found! They are soft and absorbent. I use them daily and after using them for a month now I'm still a satisfied customer! I have referred friends to these flats. I padfold these diapers and they are wonderful. I haven't wrapped them so I can't speak for the absorbency when wrapped. Thank you for selling such a great product at such a fantastic price!,5
"Little Castle Ottoman Gliding Plush, Chocolate","Like the look of it.  Fabric does not wear well.  After only a few days, the color and fabric had a worn spot from where my feet sit.  Have to cover it with a blanket or pillow to prevent further wear.",3
Safety 1st Easy Saver Diaper Pail,"I hate this diaper pail. Like really hate it.  The pop-up door is too small to fit anything into, especially with the bulky, bulbous air freshener holder thingy sticking off of the bottom of the door.  The air freshener disc rattles around in that thing making an annoying noise each time you pop that stupid door open.  It does seal tight, holding most odors in, but it's just such a pain to use that when I bought a second one, I just went with a garbage pail with a one-touch lid.  Cheaper and way nicer.",1
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)",Love these more then the sized version of the thirsties covers.Fits my 13lb baby girl great right now over Green Mountain prefolds with a snappy.Holds everything in well and love the leg gussets.,5

"SwaddleDesigns Organic Cotton Baby Washcloths, Brown Mod Circles, Set of 2 in Pastel Blue","I received these as a gift from my registry, and have come back to buy more.  These wash cloths (as well as the Swaddle Designs hooded towels and receiving blankets for that matter) are very soft on baby's skin.  The quality of materials they use are superior to the other brands I've received.  They are definitely worth the extra money spent.  The colors are just as beautiful now after multiple washes compared to other brands such as Trend Lab, which fade, shrivel up and are not as soft to the touch.",5
Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,This pillow is an excellent bang for the buck. I bought this very early on in my wife's pregnancy and it has made a huge difference. The pillow is made of good quality materials and even stood up to being run through our washer (due to my wife having a very nasty cold).,5
2 Red Hens Whole Roost Strawberry Shortcake Diaper Bag,"I had to order this bag in a hurry as I was hospitalized towards the end of my pregnancy.  I've never had a ""fancy"" diaper bag and had no idea what to expect.  I was THRILLED. It is gorgeous, bright, protected in clear pvc type covering, comes with a wipe holder/changing pad and stroller straps.I can fit, in no particular order:10 diaperswipes2 bottlesbottle of waterformula container3 outfitsrandom hairbrush/bulb syringemy wallet/phonewith room to spare. It is definitely a roomy bag, and the straps are long enough to slip over the handles of your stroller.LOVE this bag.",5
"Bright Starts Bounce-A-Bout Activity Center, Neutral","Our daughter is in the 90th percentile for height and can't touch the ground at 4 months. The spinning seat doesn't spin. It must be turned manually by the parent so kids can't choose their favorite toy. The overhead bar holds two toys that are out of reach. Including a teether that the baby wouldn't be able to reach to their mouth until they're about three years old. The bounce pad is stiff, and doesn't bounce. Basically it was a really cute design with the best intentions of being fun but it appears nobody tested the prototypes when they came back from China. This is something I see again and again. Doesn't anyone test the final product before shipping any more? Now I have to break it down, box it up, and shell out the extra 50 for the gawdawful Evenflo saucer that's festooned with a zillion tacky widgets.",2
Naturepedic No Compromise Organic Cotton Classic Lightweight Dual Firmness Crib Mattress,"This is the second of this mattress that I have purcahsed in under 2 years.  My 17 month old has used her's since she began sleeping in her crib at 5 months.  The second is for our next baby arriving in a few months.Pros:Organic, no smelly off-gasses, firm side for infant, somewhat softer side for toddler, VERY light, easy to change the sheets.Cons:Perhaps on the firm side of mattresses, but they say that is good for babies.",5
"aden + anais 3 Pack Muslin Washcloths, Water Baby",as all aden and anais products these are well made and cute as heck. They are soft and large but using them as a washcloth is just awkward to me. I would like them a lot more if they didn't have the rough binding on the edge. They are also a little too thick. I think regular washcloths work way better. I use the 2 that I have for spit up instead.,4

"Satsuma Designs Baby Mittens, Pink, 0-6 Months","This is the third set of mittens I got for my newborn girl.  These are the only ones with elastics that works.  I'm ordering another set for her today.  Not giving 5 stars because the price is too high.  Other than that, I like this product a lot.",4
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary",We have the babybjorn potty seat as well but recently picked this up for a visit to grandma's house because it was so inexpensive but my 2.5 year old loved it!  The handles are great and she loves holding on to it when sitting and she can use it to push herself up and off onto the stool when she is done.  And hard to beat for under $10!!  We ended up getting one for our house too because she loved using it so much.  Note though this seat doesn't fit elongated toilets so well (you have to push down hard and it kind of pops up) but otherwise it is great.  We like it much better than the babybjorn and for like a 1/3 of the price you can't go wrong!,5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"We just bought this monitor for our daughter, and we love it!!!! Our old monitor was picking up truckers on a local highway and getting crossed with another monitor in the area...weird because we live in the middle of nowhere.  We had enough of that.  Bought this monitor on the recommendation of a cousin who has twins and we just love it.  No static.  You can actually hear our daughter breathing!  I wish I had this when she was a baby.  We are going to buy another one for Baby #2 due this summer.  I highly recommend this monitor.",5
"DaVinci Emily Changing Table II, White",Easy to put together and real sturdy for the fact that the legs and pegs are thin. I would recommend it!,5
"Peg-Perego 2011 Prima Pappa Diner High Chair, Naif Rose","Although I like the chair, it doesn't look like the one in the picture.  The picture has a logo on the top of the cushioned fabric, our doesn't.  Also the one in the picture looks as though it has more filling in the cushion, the top is a lot fuller.  Ours is squared off and doesn't have what appears to be the rounded seam on the back cushion of the chair, it's squared off with no extra seams.  I like the chair but this was one of the reasons I chose this chair, was for the fullness of the back cushion appearing a higher quality than the cheaper less padding chairs.  For this price I expected exactly what I ordered.",3
"Dutailier Round Back Cushion Design Modern Glider Multiposition, Recline and Ottoman Combo, Light Brown",I just love this glider and ottoman.  It is very comfortable.  I love that it reclines and it is great to snuggle in it.  I wish that it was a little wider.,4
Zoobie Baby Tama the Tortoise Plush Toy &amp; Pillow &amp; Blanket,SO CUTE and SO soft!! pay attention to the sizing... I didn't and they are much smaller than I thought...MY fault!! but I LOVE THEM!!,5
"RECARO Performance RIDE Convertible Car Seats, Vibe","Safe, easy to install, great features, cool looks, would highly recommend, my 15 month old loves it, outstanding quality, comfortable!",5
Skip Hop Giraffe Safari Activity Toy,I gave this as a Christmas gift to my friend's 6 month old daughter and she loves it! The toy looks so much better in person and there's tons of textures/patterns to discover and the mirror is a plus!,5
MUGGLE BORN - Funny Cotton Canvas Tote Wizard Bag - Reusable by BeeGeeTees 02284 (Black Handle),Love it!  Very sturdy and spacious.  I bought this for my son to use as a diaper bag.  Extremely satisfied.,5
"Baby Trend Expedition Double Jogging Stroller, Skylar","I bought this stroller for my 3 & 1 year old. They love it! I read sooo many reviews before I purchased it. Great reviews! I have used it on the road & in our big country yard. It is awesome! My parents watched the kids last week. They said they used & loved the stroller, best stroller. Said i needed to tell my siblings about it. Got this for a great price & am so glad that we bought it. My husband has pushed the kids in it too & really liked it. I think we will be putting lots of miles on it. Highly recommend this stroller!",5
"dexbaby Safe Sleeper Convertible Crib Bed Rail, White",easy assembly does what it is supposed now if only my son would sleep in his crib more rather than our bed.....but products amazing.,5
"Joovy Zoom 360 Swivel Wheel Jogging Stroller, Blue","this is a top notch stroller, the only this bob has that this does not is the snack tray for 100 more bones.",5
Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat,"This seat is very padded and comfortable for my baby. It's thicker than it looks in the picture. I haven't had trouble with it sliding around, but she's not that active yet.  I don't think the hook that came with it is very great because it kept falling off the wall.  I bought a suction one instead.Great price though. I would definitely buy this again.",4
Gyro Bowl- Spill Resistant Kids Gyroscopic Bowl with Lid,"it was very cute the child I gave it to carrys it every place no spills thank god, worth every penny oh n but the way was the cheapest seller thanx",5
Ostart 8 Grey Baby Furniture Corner Safety Bumper Security Table Desk Corner Edge Protector Guard Cushion Softener,The bumper looks good and serves its purpose.  The only negative is that the double sided adhesive tape for each bumper comes in 4 separate strips.  They are cut to the right size but it takes a good amount of time to peel each and stick it to the bumper.  If they were already attached to the bumper it would be a much simpler process.  Overall they are good for the price and I would purchase again.,4
"BOB Handlebar Console, Duallie","This really should automatically come with BOB strollers, as it is very needed.  It's so much better now that I have it, since it holds my coffee, keys and cell phone...plus snacks when I go for walks with my son.  Well worth the purchase price.",5
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"This is extremely easy to put up/break down. We use for travel and home. My 22 lb 9 month old seems very comfortable sleeping and playing in it. I do wrap a quilted blanket around the pad for extra comfort, but he'd probably be fine without it. I definitely recommend this playard! No frills, BUT A GREAT VALUE!",5
"Joovy Spoon Walker, Greenie","This is a great walker! my 8 month old zips all over the house in this walker. The front is nice and big to put toys on. Also, keeps her from reaching objects as well!",5
Gund Baby HuggyBuddy - Collections (Spunky - Blue),"We love this 'blankie' Our son had received one when he was born, same brand and he latched onto it right away...he has acid reflux so he was constantly spitting up on it. Everytime he was without it he became fussy, so we had to buy another one, it's large enough that he will be able to hold on to it for years to come, yet small enough for him to cuddle with now at 7mos. We are very pleased with it, well worth the money.",5
"Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White","I didn't buy a boppy right away, but do not make that mistake. It is a back saver. Easier to position baby and less of a battle when baby has trouble latching on. Make sure to buy an extra slipcover.",5
DaVinci Emily 4 Drawer Dresser - Espresso,"Love the dresser, disappointed only because there was a small scratch on it when we got it.  Nothing too noticable so we didn't try to return it or anything.  Took awhile to put together, directions not very helpful.  But I still give it 4 stars because now that it's put together and in the babys room, I like it a lot and would recommend it.",4
Hazelaid (TM) Adult Hazelwood-Amber Necklace - 16&quot; Milk &amp; Butter,"I bought this for myself after reading about all the amazing things the hazelwood does. I already had a amber teething necklace for my 2 year old that had been sharing it between my 2 year old and 4 month old. And really noticed a difference in the child that it wasnt on, fussy, drooly etc. So decided to order a few of these and give them a try for the family. The adult sized one was the first to come in so that is now on my 2 month old. Still waiting for the others to come in. But his pain has decreased a lot. No longer in pain. He is still nawing on his hand but no more crying or drooling!! LOVE these necklaces.",5
"Jeep Deluxe All-Weather Umbrella Stroller, Carbon","The Jeep umbrella stroller is a great value for the price. It is lightweight yet sturdy, and folds up nicely for when you need to get it in the car or for when you are storing it away.  The stroller rides smoothly and has wheel locks when you need it to stay put. Nice feature is the window at top so you can see inside with having to bend down and look in. This looks stylish without being overbearing and has essential ameneties like a cup holder, side pocket, and storage under the seat because you are going to need it unless you want to carry a backpack everywhere you go. You need to decide whether you want a heavier type model or lighter type to suit your location--there's no one size fits all when it comes to stroller. For this weight class and size it's quite good. Hope this review helps a little in making your decision.",4
Set of 3 Construction Utensils with Construction Plate,"We gave this to our nephew (he's 2.5) for Christmas. He loved it! It was packaged well and it felt very heavy duty, like the utensils wouldn't bend if you smashed them around. I did not get to use it but I think they were very happy with it and we thought the quality was excellent.",5
"Boon Fluid Sippy Cup,Blue/Orange",I saw the bad reviews and got it anyways because I didn't want to believe that Boon would make a bad product but this is a total fail! Believe what you read and don't waste your time and money like I did!,1
Combi Flare Lightweight Stroller in Mandarin,"I absolutely love this stroller.  It fits very nicely in the back of my Mazda 6 wagon.  I bought it specifically to remain in my car, but not take up as much room as my Graco Quattro (which is an awesome stroller, too...just VERY large)  I used to own a minivan, but downsized to the station wagon, and it fits very nicely while leaving plenty of room for other things.I get compliments on the Combi Flare all the time.  People are always asking me where I found it...no stores in this area sell it.I actually purchased a Jeep umbrella stroller first, and was not satisfied with it.  When I put my baby in it, he looked very cramped and uncomfortable.  I returned it the next day, went home, and ordered the Combi Flare with next day shipping.  The Combi is DEFINITELY worth the extra $30.Recently, we took it to a water park.  I have 2 children (4 yrs and 7 mos).  We were able to fit everything we needed by either stuffing it in the basket below, or in a bag hung over the handle bar.  Also, on the back of the canopy, there is a handy little pouch where you can put a water bottle, or cell phone, or keys.I use the Combi mostly to carry my 7 month old, but it can also hold the 4 year old...the weight limit is actually 50 lbs.[...]I highly recommend it...worth every penny spent.",5
North States Supergate Wire Mesh Gate,Very nice and once you mark the spot in ink where the lock goes it works without problem.  If you don't mark the tooth placement then you will spend more time and get frustrated.,5
Dreambaby Sliding Window Lock 2 Pack,"This works as advertised and does the job. Thieves can't break the window and get in. The only thing I worry about is that I'll lose the wrench key and then not be able to get out myself in an emergency. Make certain that you tape the key to the wall, somewhere that a thief can't see it but that you know where it is. You can't hang it because it will fall off; there's no hook on it. But if you tape it, that works.",4
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Quarter Moon","I was looking for a night light ,portable and safe for my baby's little fingers ,That is the one, i did read most of reviews and i decide to buy it ,worth's the money ,she grabs it ,play with it,throw it in her crib and still working in perfect.We live overseas that that was my only concern if its going to work with 220V which they use here, IT DOES!!!  works perfect with a plug adapter .Totally happy about my purchase .",5
"Kidco Adhesive Mount Cabinet and Drawer Lock, 6 ct.",We put these on every cabinet in my son's bathroom.  So far the adhesive is holding up great and he can't get in to the cabinets.  I like that the push pad to unhook the latch is large and easy to press.,4
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","We purchased this swing after we burned through the motor on our 3 year old My Little Lamb swing. Fisher Price has done an upgrade/remodel of their swing designs since our last purchase and most of the upgrades are beneficial. Overall, the swing is sturdy and works well. I really like the added option of the plug, as with the previous model, we were going through multiple packages of D batteries or always waiting for the batteries to charge. The key changes vs. the last model are changes to the design of the legs (which makes it more stable), a five point harness (vs. three in the previous model) and modifications to the control panel (buttons vs. dials).  Overall, I'm pleased with this product, especially the plug in feature, but there are a few annoying design features. I'll also say that assembly on this was not as easy as I remember.  The directions weren't specific for the leg installation and it was hard to see the angle from the drawing in the manual, so we ended up putting on the legs improperly. It wasn't a huge deal....just use the small back stabalizing bar to guide the placement of the legs.PROS:--It plugs in! (No more going through D batteries every week!)--Very soft and plush fabric on the seat covering--Cute mobile and mirror (My 11 week old smiles every time she sees herself in the mirror!)--Several different music options--Ability to shift the cradle swinging motion (front to back and side to side)--Harness straps can be used as a 5 point or 3 point harness, allowing for extra securityCONS:-Assembly options were not clear (not a deal breaker, just annoying)--There is a stuffed rabbit attached to the clip on the harness in the front. It is cute, but cannot be removed and ends up getting in the way when you are trying to clip the harness--Again, a minor con, but there are now multiple steps to get the swing going (have to push the power button, adjust the speed buttons, turn on the music and mobile).  The swing will not start until you turn on the power switch and then adjust the speed buttons, it will not start automatically. In the previous version, you just needed turn the dial. It's only a minor inconvenience, but makes it a bit more complicated (especially for visitors/babysitters that may not be able to intuitively operate it).",4
Hard Rock Cloth Diaper &amp; Laundry Detergent - Motley Clean,This gets my diapers clean and I feel great knowing it has nothing scary added.  It did take another rinse in my washing machine than when I was using Ecosprout though.,4
Kidco Anti-Tip TV Strap - 2 Pack,"The Kidco Anti-Tip TV strap works like a charm on my 42"" LG plasma television. There are screws for many different sets and the ones that fit my LG gave me no issues. Installation was a breeze, taking roughly 20 minutes to install both using the method where you basically anchor it into your furniture (as opposed to the studs on a wall). After installation (and tightening the straps adequately), I put it through its paces and I'm confident that this TV is going nowhere. While it's true that the ends are open-ended (as many have noted), it's hard enough to get the straps off of them when they're hanging loose. When it's properly tightened, it's near-impossible (in other words, it's not happening with the situations that this is made to protect against). I have a two and a half year-old and two one years-olds who are now pulling up on everything, so this gives my wife and I a lot of peace of mind.",5
Fisher Price Friendly Flip Phone - Pink,"This phone is just fine. It meet the basic criteria - durable, safe, educational, fun, takes my 8 month olds mind off my cell phone or the remote control for a while!! My only complaint, as a Mom, is that I wish it had an on/off switch. It makes noise when she flips it open or pushed buttons - thats great - BUT....sometimes you are in a location when you dont want it to make noise - lets say church. So its not the end of the world - we have other quiet toys - but that would be a great enhancement on the phone. I assumed it woud have it since most toys we have do have an on/off for the noise feature.  Other toy phones do as I have seen them!  I paid extra for the pink phone - which really wasnt neccessary!",4
Serta Organic Waterproof Mattress Cover,"Bought one of these at local babies r us, and thought it was made of good quality and served its purpose. So I bought another here on amazon. Can't beat the price.",5
2 in 1 Professional Clinical RY230 Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead and Surface,Love this! It is fast and easy to use without waking my eight month old son. Couldn't be happier with the product.,5
Sassy Spin Shine Rattle Developmental Toy,"There are some major design flaws with this thing.  The colors are good, and the twirly mirror is nice (once you get it to spin - can't imagine a baby figuring that out), but it's hard as a rock.  Babies shake things up and down.  When they come up, they very easily hit their heads.  My kid beaned himself one too many times with this one.  It's also not easy to hold - the plastic rings that encircle the handle leave little room left, even for tiny hands.  I really liked the OBall rattle instead, softer, makes a gentle noise, and easy to hold both at the middle handle and the balls at the end.",2
KidCo Go Pod Portable Stay-and-Play Center,"I am so happy I purchased this for my daughter. I bought this for her to take to the beach, but we take it to Nana's, my sisters, hotels...everywhere! It folds up just like a camping chair and has a bag for storage. I keep it in the back of my car so I have it just in case I need it! My sisters wish they had discovered this 3 years ago!",5
,"Great, very cozy and heavy. Kept baby from rolling too much into poor position. Easy wash after many diaper mishaps. Only appropriate for early infancy. Too much for baby that is able to roll-over on his own.",5
Joovy Big Caboose Stand-On Tandem Triple Stroller Black,"We have three kids: a set of 7-month old twins and a 29-month-old toddler. I LOVE this stroller. The jumpseat for the toddler allows me to get out of the house with minimal frustration--I don't have to worry about him dawdling behind me and getting lost. The stroller drives well and manuevers around corners well. In fact, I've taken it several times to Costco and was able to push/pull the stroller alongside a loaded cart. It's not easy, but it is possible! It is sturdily built and while we've only been using it a few months, we anticipate it will hold up well. I have no problem pushing it loaded with all three kids. It does take up the entire back of our minivan, but I will trade the loss of storage for the ability to actually push all three kids at once. Based on our experience with this stroller, I would recommend the Joovy line to anyone.",5
"Newco International Channel Glider, Micro Sage","Comfortable chair, really tall back and higher arms.  So far I am really liking it but couldn't get it up the stairs inside my house so couldn't put it in the nursery as planned.  As other reviewers note, delivery is by an outside vendor.  The box the chair comes in clearly said ""two person carry"" or something like that.  How many did they send? One guy who must have been pushing 70.  He had to take it out of the box to even get it onto my porch and it was amazing that he was able to get it that far.  Aside from the delivery nightmare, it's a good chair.",3
Car Seat Organizer with tray &amp; two drink holders. 12 &frac12;&quot; long x 7&quot; high with fold out tray Measuring 6&quot; x 6&quot;. Fastens easily to headrest. Perfect for children in the backseat!,My daughter absolutely fell in love with this and she knew exactly what it was for. I like the fact that she can put her trash in the bag below which makes everything more convenient. This is absolutely wonderful!,5
"Gerber Breast Pads - Variety Pack, 100-Count","I bought these pads thinking that it would work out fine. The pads that the hospital gave me worked out better! These are not absorbant and your bra will get wet, especially at night. That was my personal experience with the product, on to something different.",1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","I bought this chair for when my grandchildren come to visit.  I like that I can also take it with me to restaurants and other people's houses with no problems.  It grows with the child, so started with a one year old.  Now that she's two, I took the liner out and it works just fine.  I agree with other reviews about the color of the straps.  A darker color wouldn't stain so much.",5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,"very good highchair, nice and padded so it is really comfy for my baby. it reclines and is pretty east to clean.",5
"Dena Happi Tree Plush Pillow, Pink",We love this pillow! Matches my daughter's room decor perfectly and she loves it also! We love Dena Happy Tree line!,5
BABYBJORN Cradle,"We've been using this since day one.  I bring it down to the living room for the daytime naps and upstairs next to our bed at night.  My son loves it and when he's fussy and just rock it gently and he falls asleep.  The quality seems very good, it's easy to put together and easy to clean.  The only thing I would change would be to make a way for the legs to fold up for moving around the house.  It's hard to maneuver through tight spaces since the spring like feet don't fold up.  Overall, I highly recommend this.",5
Philips AVENT Newborn Starter Set,"When I had Eli - everyone was recommending avent - avent - avent.  So, that is what I registered for and was using, until...  2 1/2 months and Eli and I had to spend a week in the hospital.  The nurses there told us that avent's nipple is the most difficult nipple to suck from - it was way too hard for Eli to suck from.  We found evenflo worked best for us.  So, I recommend before investing in a lot of one type of bottle, test out a few and find out what works best for your child.",1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,I got this for my changing table and it looks great. i might get another one to put downstairs on the pack and play.,5
"Philips AVENT Soothie Pacifier, 0-3 Months, 2-Pack, Pink/Purple",Great product!,5
Ubbi Cloth Diaper Pail Liner,"Tried it on two pails, both normal diaper pail sized, both meant for cloth diapers. It DOES NOT FIT them.So unless I wanna hang this off of something it is entirely useless to me. I can't review its efficacy or odor blockage b/c I can't even use it.Just warning you.",2
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,I used this carrier for about 2 weeks and it was soooo uncomfortable.  I sold it on ebay.  I instead decided to spend the money for a Baby Bjorn and Im so glad I did.  I love the Baby Bjorn.,2
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","We bought a different gate with an auto-close at first, which was so noisy! We returned those and bought several of this easy close gate for our doorways. This gate is so quiet and I love that there's an option to leave it open! It was easy to install and unlocking it is simple, while seeking appropriately difficult for a child. The only caveat is that it does narrow the doorway considerably more than our previous gate. If someone were overweight or rather wide, they might have trouble easily passing through. We are very pleased with this product!",5
"Baby Aspen Butterfly Bloomers For Fluttering Bums, 0-6 Months",Very beautiful.Comfortable to wear.Bright colors.Moderate size. Shipped quickly.

"Diaper Genie Essentials Diaper Disposal Pail withStarter Refill, 100-Count","it works for me. stores the diapers, keeps the smell out of the way, and is efficient. People have commented that they had to push the diapers down and they did not like that, but personally I do not find it much of an issue. I'm a first time mommy and as long as I fold my diapers right i do not get poo everywhere. Plus we are parents, poop is in the job description. (:",4
S. S. Noah Plush Monkeys - Momo &amp; Mimi,Me gusto la compra y la entrega fue rapida la recomiendo siempre . . . . . . .  &iquest;,5
"Untangled Living Anyware Collection Children's Stainless Steel Dish Set, 5 Pieces, Gecko","I have to say after getting frustrated with MANY stainless steel products (either rusting or becoming unsanitary with too many crevices to trap food/water), I was hesitant to order this one due to the price and fact some reviewers complained about it being too tiny. However, I was very pleased once we received it as it was bigger than I pictured and just perfect for what toddler/young child portion sizes SHOULD be...and we usually give my son one serving and then refill if he asks for ""nother one"" :) The cup specifically is perfect for little hands. Had an issue with some adhesive in the packaging getting on the inside of the cup, but with some elbow grease, got it off. Many people swear by the quality of this set lasting them years and still going strong, even after dishwashing. The design is cute, and the quality is the absolute BEST I have ever seen for this type of item. Non-toxic and completely unbreakable. I will be looking to get more of these sets ASAP!!!",5
"LittleLife Safety Harness, Black","I actually bought this to keep my 10 month old in shopping carts.  He is always trying to escape and not afraid of heights.  I wanted a 5 point harness instead of the dinky strap in the shopping cart.  I made a starp that attaches to the back loop on the harness and to the cart.  Works well.  He is 16 pounds.  It fit him when he was 14 pounds as well.  This is not for real big kids, but should fit most babies and toddlers.  Very nicely made.",5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"So, you can't go wrong on the price.  I looked at TRU/BRU and for the same ""ish"" thing - it was going to be double.  They are a pain to put together, my husband wasn't too happy.  We used it on a newer ""plush"" deeper fitting queen mattress.  The mattress comes up mid-way on the rails, so it's not the same as it's pictured.  I am not sure that we will ever be able to figure out how to collapse the sides to ""make the bed easier.""  I am just careful to tuck the bedding without catching it on the hinges.  It's not the best product, but for the price, I'll take the few drawbacks.",4
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","This is GREAT to cradle your baby. My son loved the feeling of something being around him, and with the head and body pads it worked perfect. It is also very durable. I washed and dried it a million times and it is still in great shape so I can use for my next baby.",5
"JL Childress Gate Check Bag for Umbrella Strollers, Red","This bag protected my Zooper Twist stroller with no problems at all. We just returned from vacation, each way had a layover, so four flights total so far and no tears or holes. Amazingly, the bag still looks new! It slips right over the stroller when folded up, and comes out just as easy. It was a good investment since we bought a pricey stroller!",5
Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Activity Center,"Let me preface this by saying my 14-month old granddaughter has special needs (hydrocephalus), so I'm always on the lookout for safe, stimulating toys that match her achievement level.  This is a winner!  Here are the reasons:It turns 360 degrees, but it doesn't bounce or swing to side to side which is important.  She is using her legs a LOT more with this and I think we'll soon be able to go to the next setting to make it taller.There are so many different activities, some of which she has mastered and some she will!It has a ""piano"" and she is highly motivated by sound, so that's a huge bonus.There is a tray which is perfect for the toddler puffs she has just started picking up and she loves to turn all the way around and then find some.In short, I credit this toy with increasing Emma's balance and control and, while I'm sure they never envisioned it as a therapy tool, that's exactly what it's turned out to be and we are very grateful!p.s. We took off the arch because, the way it's made with the nets coming down so far, Emma kept running into it.",5
Lite-on-Shoulder Baby Sling,"The sling arrived quickly, and I was pleased with the quality of the fabric.  The instructions that came with the sling were not great, so I went to You Tube and found many videos about sling wearing.  Watching a few videos gave me more confidence in the use of the sling and ensuring the safety and comfort of my baby.We have been using this sling for about two months and baby and I are very pleased.  My baby is clingy and likes to be carried, so she really enjoys being in the sling. It makes doing tasks and shopping much easier while she is content and both my hands are free.  It is much more comfortable than my Baby Bjorn (which I still use), but it is not as quick to get her into.  It does take practice to use the sling, but once I used it a few times I felt much more confident about it and I find I am using it more often because it is comfortable and baby loves being able to look around and also to look at me and cuddle with her head on my shoulder.I would recommend this sling, the price is great and it is just as nice as many of the more expensive slings I looked at in some fancy baby boutiques in my area.",5
JJ Cole Essentials Diaper Bag Sky/Lemon,"This has been the perfect diaper bag - so easy to wear and compartments for everything.  It looks compact, but is pretty roomy.  I have a 3 year old and 18 month old and carry my cell phone, wallet, plenty of snacks, sippy cup, 2 diaper and wipes everywhere we go.  I haven't missed all the excess stuff I used to carry in my uncomfortable previous diaper bags.  Love it.",5
Spectra Baby USA S2 Hospital Grade Double/single Breast Pump NO TOTE,The only medela I've used is the symphony when I was in the hospital and when I go to work. This thing has a lot of power and expresses more milk in less amount of time than the symphony. I have converted my medela tubing to work with this pump because I needed bigger flanges and didn't want to buy the spectra one-- they are so expensive!! medela equipment is also easier to obtain.,5

Bella Tunno Diaper Ditty Wristlet Spanish Dots,"This is a great little item which I carry around in my regular handbag. Since I have a toddler, I don't need a bulky diaper bag for most of my daily errands. This holds a few diapers and the travel wipes pack nicely, but keep in mind that it won't fit in smaller handbags. I also love the design of it (nautical) - the patterns and colors are nicely coordinated.",4

"Vulli Sophie Giraffe Vanilla Teether, Colors May Vary",My daughter loved this toy when she first started teething. I love all of the Sophie Giraffes and would highly recommned these products!,5
Ergo Baby Carrier - Organic Navy Plaid,"I love my carrier--like most people.  I have a back injury and was worried how I would carry my child around.  I used the Moby Wrap at first, so never used the infant insert on this. AT 3 months I switched to this--my son was long enough.  It is GREAT!  He LOVES it--and i sometimes just wear it around the house with him in it if he is fussy.  My son is 6 months now, and I can't imagine not having it.For you bad back people--the reason this one works so well for the back, is the strap sits down on your hips.  If it was higher, it would KILL me.  Other carriers the strap is more on your waist, and that puts weight on your back that equals pain.  This one puts the weight on your hips--so no back pain.",5
"Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008",This item is the nicest swing I have ever owned. My daughter loved it. I wish I had it for all of my kids. I know there were some motor issues with the first ones on the market but mine wasnt like that. It may cost a little more but really I would have spent double the price because it really is that nice. I would only change a couple things but really not much. not all the straps come off to be washed so i had to take mine apart a little to wash the straps cause kids spit up on the belts. It would be cool if the circle on the base was smaller so you could take it fully asembled through door ways and if it had some type of handle to pull it around instead of just the little ledge cause thats not to easy to hold on to. In the end this is the best swing ever. The AC adapter is amazing. Part of it broke on me and I need to call the company but for now I am using the batteries which have lasted forever.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow My Friend Emily Take Along Toy,Emily is deinfitely a freind to my three month old. She seems to be somewhat of a high strung baby. She fights with emily!!! But Emily keeps her occupied for a while. It's just that for some reason she gets so frustrated when playing with toys that I eventually have to take emily away for her own sake but Emily is a great toy.,5
"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane","I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the material for it feels rather rough and cheap, and while this is still on the inexpensive end of convertible seats, I still expected the material to be higher quality for the price. (We purchased the Coda style.)It is an overall nice seat, our son is 98% for height, and fits well in it at 6 months, though the head support is already on the highest setting. So I do worry how quickly he will outgrow it.We drive a very small car, the 4 door 2010 Toyota Yaris hatchback. and it just barely fits in it, we will not be able to recline our seats. That being said, I don't feel that it takes up much more length than our infant seat did, we were not able to recline our seats then either. So while it is big, it does still fit in our very small car.We have not had it for long, but so far our son seems to be very comfortable in it, fell right to sleep. The head support holds his head very well so that he can sleep comfortably, even though he is upright. He also already loves the cup holders at 6 months. The first thing he did was reach for them.Pros:PriceCup holdersFits in economy carEasy installationCons:Cheap feeling material",4

Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,After receiving many many blankets for my baby- these are pretty much the only ones that I use now that baby is about 4 months old. The others are just too small.

"Maxi Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat, Sweet Cerise","I did a ton of research before making the big jump to buying a convertible car seat but the one I picked didn't fit in my Ford Focus. Frustrated, I picked another online that had decent reviews without seeing it, I was not impressed and returned that as well. Finally, I got this seat and I am happy I did- third time's a charm!PROS:-The fabric is super soft and cozy.-The seat is by FAR, the most padded and cushy of every single seat I touched at both Babies R Us and BuyBuyBaby. It is definitely going to be cozy for my little girl on both long and short car rides.-Shoulder straps have padding so they don't dig into baby's neck and even the buckle has padding around it!-Easy to tighten and loosen the harness.-My husband installed it easily within a few minutes.-Fits well in our Ford Focus and allows me (5'6'' to comfortably sit in the passenger seat still.CONS:-Any wetness (drool, sippy cup drips, etc) leaves a mark. I haven't attempted to clean it yet but it seems like they are just watermarks not stains and will come out.Overall- A great seat for the price- a little more than I originally wanted to spend but worth every penny because it is worlds better than the seats in the $150-200 range.",5

"Sunshine Kids Radian XTSL Convertible Car Seat, Bentley","I bought this car seat after much research.  I have a Mercury Mariner that I drive for work and could not fit my infant carrier or my Britax car seat in the center with a booster seat on each side.  So I bought this since it was the smallest car seat I could find.  Now it is a MUCH better fit in the center position - it was very easy to install and I have now used it for the baby for over a month so he was about 10lbs when I first put him in it.  He was very secure and the extra padding pieces make it so he doesn't flop down in the seat.  He now just uses the body padding and it is perfect...he is up to almost 17lbs.  It was very easy to install and I saw how people said that the bottom piece you use for rear facing falls off when you remove it, but it actually clicks pretty securely in place so I have not noticed that.  Now I will say that it is not easy to fit 3 across even with this car seat...they show it with 3 but they are all 5 point harnesses.  I have to use 2 backless boosters and this and the kids have trouble getting their hands down in there to buckle their seats.  I have to make sure that they are pulled as close to the door as possible so they can fit their hands...I can not fit my hand in there and I am very small boned.  So their claim is a little deceptive...so just to set the correct expectations!",5

"Megaseat Infant Floor Seat with Safety Belt, Ruby Red","I bought this seat for my 6-month-old granddaughter who can't quite sit-up yet.  She's able to sit up in this just fine, and it seems to be helping her to strengthen her back so she can do this by herself.  The quality is excellent.  And the higher back is much better for baby than the Bumbo seat that was used by her older brothers.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the belt is difficult to adjust and doesn't adjust very much at all.P.S.  If you buy the tray that goes with this, please know it's handy, but a real pain to attach.",4
Dreambaby Toy Chain,"We have a small house with a toddler so I was looking for things to save us space and get toys up off the floor... we ordered this with a couple of the hammocks for the stuffed animals and boy, this has made a huge difference in her bedroom.

"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","Like other reviewers, this gate proved to have quality features in all the right areas. I'm using it for pets. However, it could not be opened by my (active, strong) three-year-old until we we showed her the trigger pull for opening.I'm using both extensions and install took about 10 minutes. Clarification on &#34;screw-in&#34; portion: this gate does not screw into anything.  Rather, there are small disks that can screw onto the wall to hold the tensioners in place from slipping/sliding.  If you are mounting into solid wood, you might not need them, so long as you torque the pressure rods with the included wrench. The disks are additive, and probably useful for softer surfaces (drywall) or slick wallpaper.  Think of the tensioners and screw-in disks as cup-and-saucer, not bolting the gate to the wall.",5

San-X Tarepanda Figure Plush Doll Stuffed Toy Sz L,"This isn't actually plush, by the way, but rather made out of beads like all of the other reviewers said. If you want to do a size comparison, if it sits on my laptop(17&#34; screen), it fills up the not only the keyboard, but the whole surface as well. It is ~6 inches high. In general, large, just as the name says.The actual material is a little scratchy, but nothing that I don't mind. You get used to the feel. It's also stretchy. The black material is different and a little softer, but less stretchy. This does not effect my review at all.The only downside is that it comes with a factory smell. The one that you would get if you walked into a Home Depot. I suggest putting this in the sunshine for ~5 - 6 hours and see how that works if it bothers you that much. I can only smell it if I put my nose right up to it.The shipping was /extremely/ fast. I ordered this on Jun 9, and received this today on the 19th. Considering it's coming from China, it's very fast. I do recommend this to everyone because it's just awesome :)",5
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"This is definitely a nice luxury.  We have also found that the pop-up dispenser doesn't work, we stopped trying after the first week.

Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I bought the Diaper Dekor Plus and the Diaper Dekor when my daughter was born. She is now 2 years old and it is still a wonderful product. Since she is still in diapers and my second is due in a few weeks, I will be purchasing another one. There are never any smells coming from it and it is so easy to use. I've never tried another diaper pail, but I have many friends and family who have and they have lots of complaints. I highly recommend this product!!!",5
"Luvable Friends Grow with Me Potty, Blue","The very bottom piece SUCKS to clean. I'm not talking about the part that the kids actually pee in, I'm talking about the base. It has a bunch of partitions (perhaps structural, perhaps TOTALLY UNNECESSARY) AND a lip all the way around that does not allow you to easily dump out all the water you have filled it with for rinsing. Wiping it is not an option either, due to all those silly partitions it would take quite a while. I spray it with cleaner then use the shower head to rinse it into the tub and then do a little dance shaking it around in every conceivable direction until most of the water comes out, then call it a day.That being said, I used this for both my kids and it doesn't have any other issues.",3
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small",this wetbag has been used and used. We have had it over a year now and it still hold in the smell and liquid as it should.,5
Peg Perego Ultimate Lightweight Stroller- Black/ Toffee,"I purchased the Peg Perego Aria stroller last month for my 3rd son.  Needless to say, I have lots of experience in the stroller world.  This was my first Peg Perego stroller purchase as I have used Graco and Maclaren in the past.  I had been using my Maclaren umbrella stroller (which I purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old) and thought I would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old.  My girlfriend recommended the Aria so I purchased it.  Anyways, it was a huge disappointment.  The steering is AWFUL.  You definately need TWO hands for this stroller.  The stroller is also extrememly ""wobbly"".  I was shocked as I figured such an ""upscale"" brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much.  The 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little ""envelope"" type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place.  It is bulky in that it doesn't fold into a small compact stroller.  I used this 3 times and just gave it away...what a waste of $$. I'm back to using my Maclaren, which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller.  I could kick myself for wasting the money.  My advice to you is TEST it out before you buy it!!!(don't rely on the name)",1
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"I bought this seat when our daughter was around 2 1/2 months old because I though &quot;How cool a papasan for the baby that vibrates like her bouncy seat&quot;. WRONG, The worst things about this seat are as follows: the vibrate times out, the baby even at this early age could not be tucked because her feet went beyond the edge of the seat. The good things: the seat is incredibly cute, it would have been great when she was a new newborn because you could tuck her all snuggly like newborns usually like and she would have only needed the vibrate on for a few minutes to soothe her. That said I would not recommend this seat as a purchase must since the good do not outweigh the bad in my oppinion. My cat did howeever finally put this seat to good use claiming it as his own new bed, and he does like the vibrate, but not the music :)",3

"The First Years Take &amp; Toss Toddler Bowls, 8 Ounce, 6 Pack","I've been using these bowls for my one year old and they are great.  I use them for snacks, for taking her food to daycare, and for her leftovers.  Dishwasher safe and microwave safe.  I got boy colors the first time and girl colors the second time.  It doesn't make much of a difference to me, although I understand that some folks may not like the surprise.  The daycare loved these bowls so much, they have suggested them to all the other parents.",5
Lil Rinser Splashguard in Purple,"We bought this to use with our 2 year old at bath time. Hair washing was always a chore and this has been a lifesaver! Works great, quality product, and alleviates the crying during hair washing!",5

"Danzo Diaper Canvas Tote Bag, Deep Ocean","If you're a person who likes making lists and staying organized, you'll love this bag! I can find anything in a second. I no longer have to dig to get to things. It's super cute too. My only complaint is that there are more small pockets than large ones. If they could add some bigger pockets, this bag would be beyond perfect!",5
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,If I could give it zero stars I would. Just got this gift for Christmas. I would return it if I could. The purpose is to suck to the wall and hold bath toys. Well it doesn't work because it doesn't do what is advertised. I cleaned the area first. I made sure it was dried. I pressed and turned and lasted not even 2 minutes on the wall. It fell each time. First with the bucket and 5 toys next without the toys then just the bucket and lastly just the suction and it FELL anyway each time! I then wet the suction next used rubbing alcohol to help with the suction as advised and nothing.Buyers Beware.,1
Sealy Soybean Natural Dream Crib Mattress,"Seems well-made, and the kid seems to sleep well on it. I'm not sure about any health benefits. They sound good on paper, but I don't have any way to verify (or refute) them. Seems good if you're looking for this kind of thing.",4
Sand-Away Beach Bag ?,"So I like the size of the bag and the material, I haven't used it yet but it seems sturdy enough to do what it's supposed to.  The color is not as pictured. It's a very dull looking the green and is more of a mustard color. Thinking of sending it back just for this reason-the color is ugly. i really do like that it folds up into the pocket making it easy to store in a car or another bag. I think the bag overall will work fine just wish the color was better!",3
Carter's Bumble Comfort n' Care Playard and Changer,"Love love love this playard.  No funky smell like other reviewers seemed to experience.  We have a Graco Pack N Play also and we decided to get a second playard to keep at Grandma's house.  Well, we left the Graco at her house and kept this one at ours!  If you are choosing between the Graco and this Carter's product, here are the key differences:I'm comparing this product to a Graco Pack N Play Playard with Newborn Napper Station and changing station.Our Graco has the attached changing table but it is extremely wobbly and I refused to change our daughter on it once she got to about 9 pounds.  The Carter's product is much much better stabilized and can pivot out of the way when not in use.  Four stars for this feature.  It also seems to be much larger as I can change our now 15 pound daughter on it with no problems.Our Graco has a diaper stacker but no room for accessories like wipes etc.  This playard has a nice roomy diaper accessories area that also has the bonus of being able to fold it up inside the product when you fold it to carry on trips.  The changing table doesn't fit inside the bag with the rest of it, but neither does any product that I've seen.  You can live without this on trips or either carry it in a separate bag.This playard imo has a more appealing, plush look to it than our graco pack n play.  It's just cuter.And my favorite feature....when you fold the Carter's playard the wheels stick out of the bottom of the bag....HELLO????  This is awesome.  Our graco does not do this although some other versions of the Graco Pack N Play might have this feature.  Neither product is light by any stretch of the imagination and the wheels make it doable for my 110 pound self to pack it up and roll it to the car without needing my husband.Overall if I had it to do over again, I'd have two Carter's Playards and would have skipped the Graco altogether.  The price listed on amazon is a little ridiculous as we got ours at Babies R Us for 129.00.",5
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count","I never tried any other disposable or non-disposable brand, but generally opted to go for an environmental and long-term affordable alternative to the disposable kind. It's been four weeks, and so far I've had generally a pretty good experience with the Philips AVENT washable ones. UPSIDES: one-time expense / reusable; easily washable in the sink instead of needing to wait for a full washload; absorb quite well - I've not had any through-leakage as long as they are switched out daily (they can occasionally get &#34;soaked,&#34; but switch them out in that case). DOWNSIDES: nipple stickage after leakage sometimes (this can be reduced by regularly applying RAFAEL's natural nipple care ointment); don't always stay exactly in place depending on your bra (esp. looser ones); visible through tighter clothes since they are a bit thick, although I'm not sure how this compares to other brands.",4
"Evenflo Big Kid High Back SI Car Seat Booster, Alexa","Highly rated and its high quality is apparent upon installation and use.  My 5 y/o loves the cup holders, storage space, and the lights it has.  After I first bought it, he liked it so much that he insisted on having me bring it into the house so he could sit in it while watching TV and playing games, so it must be comfortable.  Very satisfied, and I do not think you can beat the quality for the price.  I recommend it and plan on getting another one for our other vehicle.",5
"Guess How Much I Love You Rabbit and Bunny Baby Blanket, , 30X40&quot;",This blanket is so adorable. It is very soft and comfortable. My son loves it. He just turned 2 and is a tall boy- this blanket covers him completely. He usually does not like any blankets at all but will sleep with this one only.,5
"Disney 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set, Taking The Race","When i purchased this set it was on sale  for $23.99, that is around 10-15$ cheaper than anywhere else. The set comes with two sheets, a blanket, and pillow case. The set was very nice and the ""cars"" movie theme was nicely displayed on the set. The only problem I had is that I wished the blanket was a little bit thicker.",4
"aden + anais 2 Pack Muslin Burpy Bib, Princess Posie","I purchased the swaddle cloths, bed sheet, and changing table cover in the Liam The Brave print.  I really like the size of these Burpy Bibs and that it can be used as a bib or a burp cloth.  I am happy with the Aden and Anais Products for the look and fabric.  I highly recommend their products.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Although the opening is somewhat slender, it is a solid product. The installation was fairly quick, about a half hour total. It does a good job of keeping our little boy, little destructor, from falling down the stairs.",4
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Deluxe Musical Mobile Gym,"I researched to find a gym that my son would love, and he loves staring at the mobile in his crib. This was the only gym with a mobile AND lights so I loved that there was a feature to have this on a gym. When my product came from Amazon, the mobile appears to only have a music and lights or a music and mobile option. It does not have all three like advertised. I bought this because I wanted all three so I am a little upset. I emailed fisher-price about the defect and will see if they will get me another one. I agree that all the toys are hard and I wish it had more plush hanging toys, but at least they can be swapped out and you can hang your own. Other than that it is cute but I am bitter about the false advertising.",1
SugarBooger Fairies and Berries Mini Bib Gift Set of 2,These are the best bibs for the price. I've found after four kids that I like something that snaps instead of Velcro and that looks cute! These are wonderful. We've been using them for two years and they still look fantastic and come clean. I run them through the machine and then hang them on the highchair. I would caution that they melt in the dryer. Oops!,5
"green sprouts Wooden Brush and Comb Set, Natural","This product is just ""ok"". The bristles are nice and soft, but if your baby has a full head of hair like mine, the bristles only really brush the top layer of hair. Also, the bristles fall out very easily. It's nice for now, but we'll have to invest in a different brush once she gets bigger. It is very gentle for the soft spot on the head.",3
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green",This product is great! My son loves it. It is better than a Bumbo because it has lots of toys! I would highly recommend this product to anyone.,5
"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","We found this by chance while browsing a local baby store.  After buying just one, my husband thought that maybe we should get more as security blankets always need back-ups.  Glad we did!  We have four - one for my son's daycare, and the other three at home (his room, our room, and a spare clean one).  It blankie has helped during sleep training.  Though he doesn't seem super attached to it (can sleep without it), we keep it in his crib and when he seems to always take it from side to side as he rotates while sleeping.  It's always by his arms.  Very soft and cute.  Have since given it to friends as gifts.",5
"Summer Infant Plush Pals Changing Pad Cover, Green/Brown (Monkey)",We purchased this on Amazon when we didn't get it at the baby shower. It was cheaper through Amazon at the time than Babies R Us. It holds up well in the wash and fits our standard changing pad perfectly. We got another one of the same brand as a back up for when this is in the wash. Highly recommend!,5
"Carter's Fashion Tote Bag, Giraffe Print","Gifted 2 of these bags to expecting Mommies. The quality is excellent. My friends seem to really love them and use them every time they step out with their babies.

"Britax Advocate G4 Convertible Car Seat, Zebra","VERY easy to install. Took me about 20 minutes from opening box to having it completely installed in my car. I have a 2012 Honda Accord and it does take up all of one seat and about 1/4 of the middle seat. This is not a small or compact seat, by any means, but it is very safe and convenient to use. Love the extra bells and whistles, such as lower buckle staying down flat and not getting stuck under the baby, and the &#34;pull til click&#34; to assure the chest straps are tight enough. Would definitely recommend this seat.",5
"Snoozy Organic 3 PACK Flannel Cotton Anti Allergy Waterproof Lap Pad, 12&quot; x 13.5&quot;","I haven't really found a good use for these. They're just too small. I really loved the 2 larger versions of this product and found them to be life savers. I put this small one in our car seat for awhile, but never really needed it.",2
DadGear Messenger Diaper Bag - Solid Black,"I got this because I didn't want to carry around my wife's diaper bag which has a feminine floral-pattern.  This bag is stylish and comfortable, and it's nice to be able to sling it over my shoulder when I'm carrying my baby.  It's also roomy.  The one thing I didn't like was the little pouch inside for wipes.  It's kind of confusing to put together, but once it is together it's handy.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Our daughter received this cute little toy as a gift, and we have really been enjoying it - until we realized that the paint has been coming off! I am really sad to say that even though she loves it, it has to go. I have been reading the reviews looking to see if anyone else has had this problem and also learned about the choking issues.  I am very upset about this.",1
Evenflo SimpleStep Pressure Gate Taupe,"This is just what we needed to keep our cats out of our daughter's bedroom!  We don't need the extension, but we have it in case we need it for a later use.The latch is pretty easy to use (once you read the instructions), not very loud, especially to open (in response to someone else's review, it does click shut more loudly, but still not ""loud"").  My 2.5 YO daughter can close it, but not open it.  We did figure out that we can ALMOST close it (but not latch it closed), so that she can get in and out but the cats still think it's closed.I installed it (I'm a fairly bright female, age 39) in about 7 minutes, including time for reading instructions.I really like it, she tripped over it once, but that was it, she learened really fast.  If I needed another one, I would definitely get this one again.",5
"Streamline Bird Nightlight, 3&quot;","I love the bird night light. The only thing I don't like is that is dims after being on for a little while, like the battery gets low. I have given this for a small gift and all seem to like it as well. All of the animals are so cute.",4
Skip Hop Via Messenger Diaper Bag Black,"When my first daughter was born, I bought a $30 diaper bag (can't even remember the brand).  I loved it, but it was a tad small and, after 2.5 years, it was a little worn out when #2 was on the way.  So, I decided to invest in this bag.  It gave me a little more room and was stylish and comfortable.  Plus, I loved how it could easily hang on a stroller.  It worked great for a while, but within a few months the pocket lining started to tear.  The tears got bigger and bigger, and my keys and other important things began to fall through the holes and swim around behind the lining, making it really difficult to use.  So then I cut out the lining, and just use the front pockets as one big pocket.  I should have taken a seam ripper to it, though, because now all the little threads are jamming up the zippers.  It's getting almost impossible to use the front pockets.  Then, about a month ago (my 2nd daughter was not even 9 months old) the plastic clip that controls the length of the strap snapped in two.  I now have a safety pin holding it in place.  I'm really disappointed that what I thought was an investment has turned into a mess.  I really wish I still had my old bag.",2
The First Years - Lanolin Disposable Breast Pads 30 ct.,"These are my favorite breast pads.  They are not too thick nor too thin, they don't show under clothes, and the included lanolin is great for soreness but without the mess or hassle of applying it myself.  They are a bit less soft than some of the others, but I still prefer them.  I also tried Lansinoh (my 2nd favorite), Medela (don't like these - bulky and scratchy), Nuk (thin but non-contour shape bunches up funny under clothes), and J&J (soft but too thick - I sometimes wear these overnight).",5
"Kids Line White Wooden Letter, A",Good product has the quality we were looking for beast to put up and has three nice color variations to use if needed,5
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Basket, Espresso",These are very cheaply made and flimsy.  I would not recommend them at all. You can buy much better ones at Michaels or another craft store for a similar price.,1
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","I did a lot of research on baby gates as the one I initially purchased (bought 2 - one for top of stairs and one for bottom of stairs) didn't indicate exactly how much vertical wall space you would need to install properly AS WELL as that it couldn't be installed with 4"" floor moulding.  Oh the things you learn after you open a box beyond it's return date!Anyway, due to my first oops, I needed to make sure what I was buying would be able to be installed on a wall as well as a wood banister, each with 4""floor moulding, with a maximum upper width of 48"" AND be secure, easy to use, and do all the other things the manufacturer claims it can do.  Luckily, this gate does the trick.  I can just use the pressure mounts (at the bottom of the stair area) and it still seems safe and secure.  After a bit of adjusting (and it is very touchy in how exact the adjusting needs to be) I got the gate to open and close with relative ease as promised by the manufacturer.  Sometimes it is harder to open than other times, and sometimes it doesn't always close automatically, but it does stay closed with LOTS of jiggling by the kiddo.  Again, you'll need to find that perfect adjustment, so be patient when installing.  You need to follow the directions exactly as they say. Duh.So, I really like it.  I wish it was in white, but whatever.  I wish the opening was bigger, but that's probably a safety feature.  And I wish that it was slightly more quiet when closing ""automatically"" (makes a metal-ish clang sound and echos in the wall a bit).  It works as promised, fits a wider than usual opening, seems very safe, and I like that I can take it down in about 3 minutes if needed and take with me to some place that isn't baby-safe (like my in-law's house!).  Plus, the price was awesome.  I think about $30 less than what they charged at BRU!",4
Double Universal Stroller Organizer by Booyah,It works great with my baby jogger gt double stroller.  Enough room to put water bottles for me and the kids! And extra storage room for snacks.,5
Munchkin Click Lock Fresh Food Freezer Pops,"Unfortunatly I wasn't so thrilled- I found them to be cheap and flimsy, the food doesn't stick to the stick part.",2
"Summer Infant Sleek and Secure Handheld Color Video Monitor, Grey","My husband decided to get us a video monitor opposed to a regular sound monitor.  Boy, I'm glad he made that decision - being the worrywart that I am, I am always able to check up on my son without having to walk into his room and potentially wake him up if he sees me.One of the cons is that there is a short battery life if you use the picture function a lot. I would find that I could use the monitor in the evenings and then it would die halfway through the night.  I haven't really gone very far with the monitor, but it still worked great when I was in my backyard with the windows & doors shut.From about 2 1/2 months I just left the monitor plugged in and on my nightstand so I can checkup on my DS when he stirrs in the middle of the night.  He's 6 months old now, and the monitor still comes in handy.  Right now, the monitor sits on a table next to the crib.  As my DS gets older, we'll have to find another way to mount the camera without drilling holes in anything. I forsee us using this for a long time.",4

Bright Starts Bounce Bounce Baby Activity Zone,My three month old was tired of being held all the time and this was the perfect solution! He loves all the toys he can play with and the rotating seat makes it easy. I would definitely recommend this product!,5
"NUK 2 Pack Fashion Latex BPA Free Pacifier, Size 3 \nColors May Vary",works as designed. Exactly as expected. no surprise there,5
"Fisher-Price Space Saver Swing and Seat, Discover'N Grow","We really like this swing. I wanted one that was small and easy to move around and that vibrated. When we first put it together I was afraid that it wasn't working because it didn't seem to swing and the vibration was way too strong. I figured out that if I put some weight in it (I used some books since I was still pregnant)then it worked great. I didn't put my newborn in it until he was about 2 weeks old. I don't know why I waited so long, it really soothes him. He is now 15 pounds and sits in it to watch Baby Einstein while I do dishes. I don't know if we will use it when he gets up to the recommended weight allowance, but it has been a life saver so far.Things I love are:Nice deep seat, very secure.The swing and vibration don't shut off. I have a bassinet that shuts off automatically after a few minutes and it's not quite long enough for him to doze off.Things I don't care for (but that don't bother me that much) are:The toy thing overhead is pointless and we just leave it unattached.The way they designed it to lock so it doesn't swing is a little hard to do with the baby in the swing, and comes unlocked easily when I am lifting the baby out or putting him in and it makes a loud noise and startles him, so I don't use it.I also don't care for the fabric pattern, but it's not a big deal.It does eat through batteries the way we use it, we leave the swing and vibration going for hours at a time so that is understandable.I would recommend this swing to anyone that wants one for their baby.",5
Skip Hop Duo - Cord-Camel,Great bag. Functional. Lots of places for stuff.Really liked the way it attaches to the stroller. (interchangable straps)Good diaper bag without being too feminine.,4
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink",I got this product for my 9 Month old daughter and she absolutely loves it. We decided to put the rockers on right away since there is a block in the canter back of the chair to keep it from tipping. Even with her climbing all over the chair it doesn't tip over. She loves the chair she will sit in it with her board books and rock back and forth. It is so cute and actually goes well with our living room decor.,5

"Pepperpot Baby Record Book, Molly's Nursery","I love this baby book. My daughter had one, my son has one, both of my nieces, and my nephew. I bought this for my newest nephew. I love the pages and information that it has for you to fill in. I highly recommend this baby book.",5
"Safety 1st OnSide Air Protect Convertible Car Seat, Adeline Black",I like it. the only thing I didn't like about it is the buckle. I wish the buckle reached out a little bit longer to make it easier. instead I would have to loosen the straps more for easy buckling.,4
"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","At first, I was unsure about this stroller because of some negative reviews about the discomfort of this stroller for the child (a misplaced metal bar behind the head), and I am happy I went ahead and bought it anyway.First of all, the stroller has got a pad to offer enough support and comfort to the head and back of the child.The front wheel can be locked or not at your convenience if you want to slalom easily or prefer to lift up the front wheel and turn using the back wheels (it is nice to have the option)The stroller is light weight and easy to manoeuvre which is especially appreciated when you are a 5'4 petite women.Furthermore this stroller is really easy to fold/unfold.To conclude I bought the green coloured one and I love it. It is actually less flashy bright green than the picture shows  and more of a slightly greyish green.I am extremely pleased with this purchase.",5
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free Glass Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology and Bonus Silicone Sleeve, 3-Pack","I got these bottles because I prefer the idea of warming my baby's formula supplements in glass as opposed to plastic.Pros: the wide mouth makes it super easy and mess free when measuring and mixing formula.The ounce measurements are engraved in the glass so they will not fade away after multiple washings.Cons: the nipples that fit these bottles seem really long and tend to gag my son when he takes them in his mouth.There are so many pieces, nooks and crannies it seems much more laborious to clean and prepare these bottles. Get lots to have on hand especially with a newborn or it will seem overwhelming to get them washed and prepared by your next feeding when you are overtired and you need easy.We had an easier time latching and with cleanup, using some cheap evenflo plastic bottles that we had to buy for traveling. But the over all quality of these bottles are nice if you prefer glass.",3
Babies R Us Auto Sensor Night Light - 2 Pack,"The purpose for what this item sets out to do is AMAZING but that being said--- do not buy these things if you have young kids that like touching different items. My 2 year old trying to mess around with this and ended up pulling the plastic part off and then touching the light (which was pretty warm). This item has a pretty bad safety hazard and will likely cause some child harm. If you would like to avoid the need to visit an ER or urgent care center, avoid buying them,",1
Disney Cars Folding Potty Seat,"Good to have when your not at home, it is small enought to keep in my purse or diaper bag and comes with a plastic cover so you don't have to worry about it getting dirty I like to keep one in the car just incase.  Before I got this my daughter would not go in a public restroom but this helped a lot! The only bad thing is that is can slide so you have to be careful",4
Hercules Unbreakable Helicopter RC Controler W/ Gyro stability All Skills,It's a little pricey but sure holds up. I purchased this for my son at Christmas and it's still going strong 6 months pater. Good buy.,4
Trend Lab Max Insulated Bottle Bag,"I like this bag, but it's not tall enough for the larger NUK bottles. The nipple tops will be squashed, which isn't a big deal, but I think the bag design should have taken these taller bottle designs into consideration.",3
Little Tikes Discover Sounds Cell Phone,My grandson loves this phone. He see his mom on it all the time so now he can talk as well. It is really cute when it looks like he is reading his texts.,5
Combat Daddy Equipment Model 1 Diaper Bag,"We got this bag because I needed some big enough to us as a carry on, but easy to carry with a child in convertible carseat, and another smaller electronics bag, plus my checked rolling suitcase and a large duffel bag to strap onto the suitcase.  Did I mention I was traveling alone with a 6 month old from Italy to the Northwest?  So far I have stuffed approximately 22 diapers, a travel boppy, a medium wipes case, a change of clothes for me (work out pants, t-shirt and undies) and two sleepers for my baby, and it STILL has room!  It comes with a pocket for a hydration bag, but since I cannot use this during travel, I put 16 size 3 diapers in it, I put the other 6 size 3 diapers in the front fold compartment made for them to be stored.  It is about the size as a regular military backpack (if you know what size that it is). It has one large main compartment with two Velcro pockets on the inside as well as that hydration pack pocket.  I am so excited to use this bag.  I would not recommend using it to travel overseas for security reasons, but in the states I would be comfortable using it.  Hope that helps.  I will update this and let you know how much I can actually fit in it!  The only two cons I see, which are not that bad is the velcro closures can be hard to open, but I like this and I wish it could come in a more discreet color so it could be used comfortably overseas.  Thanks!  Hope that helps!",5
Baby Brezza Formula Pro One Step Food Maker,"I was SO EXCITED to purchase this machine.  When I got it home, I would walk into my kitchen and smile lovingly at this total game changer.  Unfortunately, my happiness was short lived.  This is my first baby and he's only seven weeks old, so it took my veteran aunt to make me aware that I was feeding my baby mostly water.  I was convinced he had colic because he would not stop crying, and he could no longer go as long between bottles...it wasn't until she came and manually mixed a bottle, per the instructions on the formula container, that he calmed down (and I realized what I'd been feeding him looked more like milky water).I called customer service to see if there was possibly something, ANYTHING that could be done (they did not answer or return calls, but I did receive a return email, so email them first).  I DID NOT want to give up my magic machine, but they were pretty blase about it - responding that if the correct insert was used, the correct amount of formula was being dispensed, and that I should put the silicone scraper in (even though the directions did not specifically say to use it, and it didn't work when I did).  How can I believe the machine is working properly when I manually make a bottle and it's a totally different consistency?  The whole point is to take the guesswork out of bottle making, but I have been CONSTANTLY second guessing if my child is getting enough.  Sadly, I returned the machine today.  I just couldn't justify paying almost $200 for a machine to have to turn around and add formula to each bottle.For those who are having success, I'm seriously jealous.  I wish it worked for us because our little guy is completely formula fed, and it was amazingly fast and easy.  I ordered the Baby Brezza kettle since our baby prefers a warm bottle, but the reviews for that leave a lot to be desired.  :(  I'm hoping for the best.",2
"Pumpin' Pal Super Shields, Angled Pumping Flanges, the Best Flanges By Far in a Complete Set of All Sizes Mom Will Need","I LOVE these compared to the stock shields, they're SO much more comfortable once you get used to them. I really struggled to figure out size (I still am not positive I use the right size), but I do recommend trying all 3 and seeing what works best. I know the small ones were too small for me, the mediums seem to work best, but I do try the large on occasion and they seem to work fine, also, so they're good backups in a pinch.",5
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner for Highchairs, Blue",This product does not work well for us.  My one year old son can easily pull up the suction cups.,1
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","We purchased this when our son was 2 months old.  He still sleeps in his bassinet so we mainly got this for naps during the day in his crib.  We thought it might help him go to sleep since he already fights us when we try to get him to take a nap.  Instead of making him drowsy he gets really excited and coos and laughes at the toys.  He is now 3 months and still gets really excited when we put him under the mobile.  I'm really happy with that even, because I can get a few things done around the house while he's entertained by it.  So overall, we are very happy with the product.  Also, several reviews complained about the volume of the music and sounds.  It's just loud enough, especially with baby only being a foot from the speaker.  Great product!",5
Sassy Bathtime Pals Squirt and Float Toys,"My 1-year-old LOVES these!!  I find these particular toys easy to get the excess water out of after bath time, so I am not so worried about mold and germs growing inside.  They are also very soft, so they double as teething chewers.  ;)...I also caught my 12-year-old son playing with these during his bath time.  ;)  I heard him talking to 'Mr. Penguin' and 'Killer Whale', while splashing and swishing around in the tub...  Good to know he's still young at heart and not 100% 'big boy'.  :)",5
"Trend Lab CribWrap Fleece Rail Cover for Long Rail, Brown, Wide",I really think parents should buy these with the crib! We bought this after some nice teeth marks were put in the crib.

Sugar Booger &quot;Prehistoric Pals&quot; Feeding Collection Silverware Set,"this is so cute but i had to return it b/c the spoon head was too big for my 17 months old son.  i thought about keeping it for later when he gets older.  but it seemed way too big.  otherwise, the design is too cute.",3
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"An essential piece of equipment for baby.  The perfect place for the baby to sit while he watches the world go by.  The vibration soothes the baby and lulls them to sleep.  The colorful toys are bright and easy to grab, but a bit much for newborns. Its a good thing that the huge toybar is removable. Overall, the best gift a new mother can get or give.",4

"Angelcare Bath Support, Blue","We love this! I actually didn't find this until my little was 5 months old and already 24 inches but I needed something so my two boys could take a bath together.We first tried this... http://www.amazon.com/Leachco-Safer-Bather-Infant-Bath/dp/B00005JIVI/ref=cm_cr_pr_sims_t and it did work but didn't like how it was a soft pillow and absorbed 2 gallons of water, therefore really didn't dry between baths.The Angelcare is great since it drys quickly and is comfortable. My 6 month old is just starting to sit up but I would never leave him in the tub sitting up at this point. He's pretty mellow and docile so he sits and stays put while he watches big brother play. Im keeping him in for as long as he's not trying to wriggle out.A great purchase",5
Honey Hooded Baby Moses Basket with Pink Waffle,"it is very convenient. I have it next to my bed at night and in the morning I take it with me down stairs. You must place it on a hard surface because the baby will role on his/her side and that can cause SIDS. I put it on the bed with me and my baby was on his side so I did what the manufacturing recommended and put the basket on a hard service. The look of the basket looks a bit cheap and it doesn't look straight but it actually is straight when you place your baby in it. overall, it is a great item to have especially if you have a two or 3 story house.",4

"Safety 1st Alpha Elite 65 Infant Car Seat, Rachel","The seat is very large, which is good, but I bought it for my 10 month old and I will probably not start using it until she is a year as she looks so small in it still. It is very study though and will last for a long time once I do start using it. This is my third child and I think the quality of this seat and the plushness is excellent.",4
Sesame Street Framed Friends Green Folding Travel Potty Seat,"I bought this folding seat for my son, first use it sliped and fell into the toilet.

NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"This is hands down the best baby monitor - but be forewarned if you have to replace an aging rechargeable battery.  I have spent the better part of a morning reserarching, calling, etc. and still nothing shows up anywhere.  Sony doesn't even carry it anymore.  If I didn't have this aggravating problem the monitor would easily rate 5 stars.  For this battery issue, I can only partially recommend...",3
Fisher-Price Zen Collection Gliding Bassinet,This thing sounds like a Detroit Diesel when you turn it on.  Additionally you have to wrestle Hercules himself to get the batteries in.  We put our baby in this only when we want her to wake up.  Our dog leaves the room when we turn it on...that was not an exaggeration.,2
Lot of (12) Nurse ~ Rubber Ducks ~ Party Favors / Scrubs Doctors,"This was a gift for my nursing student sister in law.  She loved them but they were smaller than I realized.  The dimensions are listed (2"" x 2"") and they are described as a party favor, but I didn't pay any attention to that and assumed that they were full sized.  Still super cute though!",4

The First Years Newborn to Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat,"We bought this when my son was 4 mths and since then it's come long way, he s 15 mths now. The seat is comfortable , I like it as u can machine wash them. The reclining button is hard to push but rest of the features are good.",4
KNOBBY TEXTURE CHEWY TUBE GREEN,This chewy tube is ok. It is as described and students can wear it around their neck. It does make some squishy noises and it does eventually get gross like all the other chewies.,3
"Vulli So'Pure Teether, Sophie the Giraffe","After hearing so much hype about Sophie the Giraffe and having a baby who's in dire need of something good to relieve her teething symptoms I've decided to order it. I love the fact that it has handles because our baby is just getting coordinated with hanging on to small items and this is perfect! VERY (barely noticeable)light scent of rubber is to expect because it's made out of rubber! After receiving it in the mail I think some reviews that blame strong rubber smell are a little exaggerating. It is not bad at all. And yes- vanilla was meant to describe the product's color, not scent which was not mentioned anywhere in item's description. So if you're looking for something ""tasty"" this is NOT it. I highly recommend this product.",5
"Boba 3G Baby Carrier, Montenegro Black","I've owned this carrier for about 3 months now, used every day with my baby and just loved it! Sturdy canvas construction, comfortable waist and shoulder straps, easy adjustability, nice hood to cover from sun or wind. Honestly, this carrier had all that I needed. Very comfortable, I carried my baby in it for hours at a time, and she just slept through it!But today the worst babywearer's nightmare happened - the chest strap came right off when I was strapping in my baby. Luckily, she did not fall, I was able to catch her. I can no longer use the carrier, because chest strap holds the whole carrier together on your shoulders. I love this carrier so much that I am tempted to just ask for an exchange, but just no longer trust the brand - I think this really is a design flaw not just a single defect. The chest strap is designed to slide easily in a piping to accommodate different heights and postures, and when it got to the end of the piping, it just slid straight off. Scary!",1
"Baby Jogger City Elite Single Stroller, Black","I love this stroller! I bought it because of the easy fold technology, and it reclines to 150 degrees, very comfortable for the baby to take a nap. My daughter loves to be in this stroller too. She is almost 14 months. However, there're a few minor things about it that I didn't like, and that's why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5:1. The accessories need to be purchased separately, such as the rain cover and mosquito net (which were included for the Bugaboo strollers).2. It's pretty heavy for a single stroller compared to the Bugaboo Frog.3. It's a little wider compared to the Bugaboo Frog.Though I still love and enjoy taking my baby out in it. I love the little console that comes with the stroller, making it so convenient for a short walk. I just put my keys, phone and some snacks for the baby in it and there we go. Overall, it's a great stroller! I'm so glad I have it! :)",4
"Dr. Brown's Standard Dishwashing Basket, Polypropylene","I fought myself for months on the idea of putting my daughters bottles in the dishwasher vs handwashing. I then realized that the water in the dishwasher probably was hotter and more sanitary then what I was using. Each basket holds parts for 3 bottles but does not actually hold the bottle. That piece of information seems to be missing from all of the descriptions. Not a big deal, just put the bottles by the basket. The baskets are a great deal and I have 4 of them!!! only tip is to make sure that the other dishes don't have dried food on them as it may blow into the baskets.  definitely recommend",4
Snuza Hero Baby Movement Monitor,"We absolutely love this monitor. We started using this on our daughter when we moved her to her crib around 5 months old. At first, it took us a couple of nights (after being woken up scared when the alarm went off) to get the positioning right. After we figured out the positioning, and were assured the alarm really was for position instead of her stopping breathing, we have been able to sleep through the night without worry. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is losing sleep wondering if their child is still breathing. It really does give you peace of mind and we definitely do not regret spending the extra money for this device.",5
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","We already had a Space Saver that was purchased in 2012.  With another baby on the way and the older one not yet out of high chair age, we decided to buy a second one in 2013.  Apparently Fisher Price updated the design during this time, and the new style, in my opinion, is not nearly as good.The newer style does not have adjustable arms and the back is just a snap in piece that does not fully recline.  This made it unusable for our newborn.  Also, the tray is a different design and not compatible with the older style chair - not a huge deal, but we have to constantly figure out which tray goes with which chair.On the newer style, only the top restraints are removable to wash.  This is a big issue for me.  I hate that I can't run the straps through the washer with the cover so it all gets clean.  The straps have to be spot cleaned, which means they are never really clean.  Yuck.Another design issue on the newer style is that the recline adjustment pull is now in the back instead of the front.  So if you want to tilt the chair back or forward, there is absolutely no way to do so with one hand.  A huge pain when you're trying to get 2 little ones into their highchairs.I do like that it straps onto a regular chair and can be moved with ease between our dining room and kitchen tables.  The tray easily wipes clean and it has a sturdy base.  I would not recommend it for use with an infant since it doesn't fully recline, but it works fine for a toddler.  Overall, I'm pretty disappointed in the changes Fisher Price made and feel the 2012 model is much better.",3
The First Years  Take &amp; Toss Feeding Organizer,I'm an organization freak and I love this. I ended up using my own dishes for it but it works great and I would definitely recommend it!  :),5
Set of 2 Car Side Window Sun Shade Visors,"Very durable construction. I bought two sets of these window shades and was very impressed with how well they were built for the price.

Fairy Tale Fairies Pink Baby Girl Bedding 9pc Set,"I recently bought this and recieved it today in the mail. Their service was very fast, but the produst just wasn't what I had expected.

"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","First, our baby at 3.5 months didn't get the point of the ""TV"" option, but really liked the lion right away and was watching it go around with a smile.  By 4 month or so, he finally realized that the ""video"" is pretty amazing too.  Since then if we needed him to stay put for 5-10 minute, this mobile was and still is great.  The boy is 6 months now and we took the canopy off and so he watches his ""TV"" on the ceiling (although he is a litlle confused about how come he didn't see it before).  Some parents say that it soothes the baby to sleep - not for us.  We use it exclusevly as a ""good morning"" toy in the morning and/or after naps, especially if he wakes up in a bad mood.",5
"Lollaland Lollacup, Good Green","Absolutely love this cup. Very cute, love that it's made in the USA. The weighted straw is a genius idea. My 9 month old was able to suck on the straw right away.

Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,"I read the reviews for this item and should have listened to the complaints about the size.

"Babyletto Play Blanket, Tranquil Woods","I know you're not supposed to use blankets these days (everyone is afraid of SIDS) but I use this as a blanket inside the crib for my 5 month old. She still enjoys being swaddled tightly in her muslin swaddle wraps. I lay her on her back with head in a donut pillow so it doesn't get flat. She can't really move or roll around yet so I feel safe using this blanket for now. I rather use a blanket than crank up the heater because it gets so dry and uncomfortable for everyone. The cotton soften up with the initial wash as it was hard and crinkly as poplin is when new. The outside is cotton. The print is delicate and gender neutral. So is the pale green color. The inside is poly fill. Overall it's a pretty light blanket. Perfect for southern Californian winters...it has been mid 70's in the day time here in December/January. Baby probably has to sleep naked in the summer.Why only 3 stars? Well, I just don't know why this blanket is $60 for something so small and normal in looks, quality, construction. It's beautifully packaged and comes in a clear zippered plastic bag. A nice gift? Maybe. As a mom, I would buy other mom's to be presents that are more useful and practical.",3
"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","We have been using the Chicco Keyfit car seat and stroller for 10 months and have been very happy. It is easy to buckle, tighten straps, and put into the car. I do find the seat to be a ""little heavy"" when I have to carry it (my son is small). I have to disagree with some of the other reviews that this car seat ""overheats"" the child. We live in Florida and have not found this to be a problem.I love the exterior of this seat because it is very easy to clean. I have also enjoyed the matching stroller.",5
Belly Bandit Womens,"This is my 2nd pregnancy and I was experiancing lower back pain and abdominal pain.  I was a little leery about spending this much on a support band, but I couldn't be more pleased with this.  It is exactly what I needed.  It doesn't get to hot and is very 'breathable'.  It provides just the right amount of support and the sizing chart is right on.  I am 5'11&#34; and about 180 lbs, I ordered a large.  It fits now and there is plenty of adjustment room for my growing belly.",5
"The Devyn Bag - Diaper, Travel &amp; Carry-All Bag - available in Aqua and Purple","I'm a recent stay-at-home mom with two kids, and I'm SO happy to finally have one bag that meets all of my needs.  For me, this bag functions as a diaper bag + cooler + laptop bag.  I use this bag EVERY day (and I love it so much, I've purchased it as a gift for two other moms-to-be!)  I really like that it has 3 different compartments designed to meet different functions.  I use the insulated cooler compartment every day (since I never go anywhere with my kids without snacks and drinks!)  I was skeptical of the ice packs at first, but discovered on Day 1 that they work great and keep everything ooober cool.  I also like the protective laptop compartment.  It's been nice to have my laptop with me on longer excursions (I use it to entertain my 4 year old on plane trips) or when I have both kids at an organized activity and actually have a few minutes to myself to catch up on emails.  Also, I've used the laptop compartment as extra storage for other items on days I do not want/need my laptop with me.  I use the outer compartment for diapers and wipes, and I use the pockets within that compartment for my purse items.  The shoulder strap is adjustable and very comfortable every way I've worn it.  I wasn't sure I'd like the velcro closure on the outer flap, but have discovered it fastens very securely AND serves 2 critical functions for me.  First, it provides quick and easy access to the inner compartments (since I can get into the bag with just one hand, I can easily grab the extra binkie for the crying baby or sippy cup for the parched preschooler without needing to pull the car over to free both hands.)  Second, I found that the velcro flap allows variability in the bag's ""stuffing capacity"".  The bag's fabric and manufacture appear very high quality and durable and so far, have held up fabulously to the daily wear and tear I put the bag through.  Oh - and how could I forget?!  My very favorite part of this bag is the small outer pocket on the side.  Since this pocket is the ultimate in ""easy access"" I use this for my phone and keys.  I definitely recommend this bag for any mom who ever leaves the house with her kiddos -  Totally worth the money to have a durable (and stylish) bag that meets so many different functions.",5
Spectra 9 Advanced Double Electric Breast Pump with Tote! 2 Phase Cycling! Rechargeable Battery!,"I initially ordered this pump when I had twins on the way.  The pump itself worked fine, but I needed something stronger.  I was able to switch this pump for the Spectra Dew 350 Advanced Double Electric Hospital Grade Breast Pump, which works wonders for me! It is actually stronger than the Medela Symphony 2.0 hospital grade pump that I was using for the first two months of my twins' lives.The customer service for Mother's Milk was outstanding! My emails were answered in a timely fashion and we were able to make changes to my order to suit my needs.  Mother's Milk made sure that I was a satisfied and happy customer, which I am!!!! I would not hesitate to use the Spectra products and I would definitely shop with Mother's Milk again!",5
Diaper Dude Chicago Cubs Diaper Bag,"This bag is really well made. It has heavy duty stitching, which is stitched in X's in places where it might rip. It has quality, heavy duty zippers. It's made of heavy duty fabric that won't rip or get holes. I was really impressed. Because it is a little pricey, I was worried that it wasn't going to be worth the money, but it SO is. You really get your moneys worth. This diaper bag will last you through several children if you use it over and over.",5
Naturepedic No Compromise Organic Cotton Classic Lightweight Crib Mattress,"This is a great mattress.  If you are looking for a mattress that doesn't emit toxic VOCs around your little baby, this is it!  I love that it has a waterproof top.  It's also lightweight.  I don't think changing crib sheets is ever easy - wrestling a mattress out between crib bumpers, etc. is not fun.  But at least this mattress is light enough to sling around.  We are moving this into the toddler bed and will probably buy a second one for baby #2.",5
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White",Kept stubbing our toes on the bottom bar.,3
Dr. Brown's Microwave Steam Sterilizer,"It is a great product and seem to sterilize well. It saves me lots of time that I no longer have to boil water to sterilize and touch the hot bottles. I have used it for both dr. Brown bottles (both 4oz and 8oz), medela pumping accessories and Mam's bottles, it worked great! Just remember to wait enough time after microwaving to make sure it's cooled off so your hands don't get burnt. Also for the 8oz Dr.Brown bottles, lay them down sideways to make them fit in.",5
Mommy's Helper Appliance Lok,"i love this product. it serves it's purpose. my 1 year old loves to help herself in the fridge and never fails to make a mess. with this latch, I'm at ease that my child is safe and so is the food in the fridge.",5
"Infant Baby Rib Karate Pant, Brown, 18-24","these pants are wonderful..My daughter wears these pants quite often, at least once a week. They fit over her nappy, and stay up on her waist when walking/crawling . They run a little big. They are very durable. (since they get washed at least once a week)I purchased the brown pants and they don't show dirt.",5
"Britax Parkway SGL Booster Seat, Cardinal","Bryce got his first Parkway for Christmas and just thought he was a ""big boy"". Bryce then requested an upgrade in both sets of Grand Parents to his new ""big boy"" car seat. To a ""little boy"" that did not like his other car seats minus his Britax Dipolmat, how could I not honor his request. In January, I purchased two more Britax Parkway's for each set of Grand Parents.The latch systems is wonderful for you do not need to worry about it falling over when Bryce is not fasten into the set. He also is able to help click the seat belt and extra protection between the leg belt.My only problem is that the back support is slightly loose, when Bryce not sitting in the Booster Seat. Once Bryce is in the seat and buckled, it id not moving. I think it is a design to allow for different types of backs in the seats.",4
BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Bassinet,I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY GRANDCHILD TO LAY IN WHEN TRAVELING. TOO THIN AND FLIMSY. COMES WITH A THIN PAD THAT CAN BE COMPARED TO THE CHANGING PADS THAT COMES WITH DIAPER BAGS. WASTE OF MY MONEY.,1
Munchkin Sesame Street Toddler Bowl,"I am surprised by all the great reviews. This bowl is absolutely adorable. Because it's cute, I bought it again after the first one cracked...from regular use. I thought it must have just been a fluke. It didn't even fall or anything. It cracked from the regular top rack dishwasher use. I bought 2 of them the second time around. They barely get used. The one's decals are already peeling after only a couple runs through the top rack of the dishwasher. My son loves Elmo. I really wanted to like this item, but it would be best as a play kitchen toy only. It is not durable at all.",2

"JJ Cole Mode Diaper Tote Bag, Cocoa Tree","I bought this when my son was almost 9 months old and we've used it for about a month now.  It is VERY narrow.  None of the inner pockets can be used because the inside is only like two inches wide, so if there's anything in the center area, the pouches can't be used and vice versa.  I think it will get better for us when he's a bit older and we don't need to carry as much stuff.  Bottles are difficult to carry unless you only use the outer side pockets for them, meaning you can only carry two, and there's exactly no room for a can of formula or a formula separater.  We've taken to using M&M; minis tubes to separate our formula because they're the only thing narrow enough to shove in the inside pockets.Here's a list of what we usually carry, and this packs the bag completely full.-Travel pack of wipes, 4-5 diapers, and the included changing mat (which is awesome, I might add) in the back outer pouch-Mommy essentials (keys, wallet, lip gloss) and sippy cup in front outer pouch *Sippy cups DO NOT fit in the outer side pockets*-Two bottles, one in each outer side pocket-Inside pouches-Four tall M&M; containers and two short ones with formula *Yep, that's right.  That's all we can fit in those inside pockets.  Out of all EIGHT of those inside pockets, we use ONE.*-A change of clothes and a set of pajamas, two more bottles, and some small toys go in the center areaSo if your child is attached to any stuffed animals or blankets, you're toting them around either free or in another bag, because they won't fit anywhere in this bag.All that being said, it's super cute and I get complimented all the time on it, and the stroller clips are wonderful.  The straps are comforable and durable.  The fabric on the bottom of the bag started showing wear within days, and with me being very careful about where I set it, but I can deal with that.  Definitely NOT the bag for you if you're an overpacker!",3
"Taggies Naturals Organic Toy, Puppy","This is my son's car toy, we take it everytime we go somewhere. I feel safe knowing that it is organic (safe for him to chew/suck on) and also soft (in case we were ever in an accident.) I thought it was expensive for a stuffed animal but it is bigger than I expected and a good size for him to hold on to by himself. I love the colors - VERY CUTE!! I would buy again!",5

"Earthlust 2 Pack Replacement Nipples, Sippy Top","I received a two-pack of replacement ""Sippy"" tops that fit the Earthlust Birds and Bees bottle, which is what I was hoping for -- despite the photo of the water bottle on this product page.  When you order this item, you get only the two sippy tops.These sippy tops are hard to find.  I first contacted Earthlust and was told that they are working through a production issue and are unsure when they will again be available.  I was very pleased to find them on Amazon.  Very high quality product!",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",i am a new mom and it could be because i wasnt doing something right but before i got this bra i was manually holding my medella pump in stlye dual pump and for some reason it would hurt so abd and i would only get about 1-2 ounces in 30 mins. i have rather large breasts 40D so when i saw that the size chart wanted me to get the xs s m i was shocked as i am always buying L  XL and XXL items. well i am shocked at  what a different this bra has made. i am hooked up to it now..hands free!! writting this review because in 5 mins time i already have 2 ounces. the bra is nice and snug and help ush the milk towards the nipple for it to be suctioned. its super comfortable and with the extra accessories it really can grow/shrink to  the size you need,5
"Safety 1st Finger Pinch Preventer, 2 Count","After my 4 year old slammed a door on my 2 year old's fingers, I decided to try these out. I installed one per the manufacturer's directions, located about two inches below the top hinge on an interior bedroom door. It only took my four year old one good push to cause the horseshoe shape to bend and strip the fasteners out of the door side plate on the hinge. Now I have a door repair project for my efforts.Try something else, or maybe only use these on the jamb side instead of the hinge side.",2
Vitamin Protecting Breast Milk Storage Bags with Oxidation Blocker (8 oz-36 count),"I LOVE these bags. They're super strong, and they stand upright making it easy to pour your milk into them.

I love knowing the vitamins in my milk are protected.",5

Ingenuity Washable Playard With Dream Centre - Shiloh,"This worked great for our oldest to sleep in. We started using it to change our Newborn but the bottom started unlocking and popping up randomly.  Once it started to fold up while he was on the changing pad! Also, It can't be rolled while open. Our 18 month old tried to push it out of his way so he could reach a toy and it collapsed on him.We emailed about the issue and they told us we were probably setting it up incorrectly and told us to watch the set up video. We follow the set up directions every time and it will stay locked as long as we don't touch it (But what is the point of that!).",1

VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units,"I bought these to help with caring for my grandfather. He lives next door to us and needed to have an easy way to call us for help. We already had a life alert system that he still wears but we wanted something a little quicker in response. His unit is very sensitive and he can be heard all over his 890 sq ft. house and we can use the parent unit to respond when he calls to let him know we are on our way. The range is really good on these and since we are in two different houses using these, the reception is spotty and the unit will beep at us. However, that said even when the unit is &#34;out of range&#34;, we still get reception and can answer back.",4
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,I bought this toy for my daughter who at the time was 1 month old and it actually caught her attention.  She was asleep within minutes. She is now 2 months and she smiles everytime I turn it on for her. The music is so relaxing it even puts my husband to sleep. I was going to buy the Aquariam crib toy but this one caught my attention and I dont regret buying it.  Moms if you want your baby asleep fast this is a MUST have.,5

"Philips AVENT BPA Free Natural Polypropylene Bottle, 4 Ounce, 3 Pack","We have the natural glass bottles as well but the day care doesn't allow glass bottles so we bought these since we liked the natural glass ones.  They look and feel high quality, the bottles seal well so they don't leak.",5
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","I bought this for my daughter because she started getting her feet stuck in the crib slates.  It's the perfect SAFE bumper to use and it's actually much cuter than I thought it would be.  The light pink is a really soft color and it does the job!  Once it's installed, it's not a problem to change the sheets and barely moves when you do.  Five star product for sure!P.S.  It did take a little time to put on, but well worth it.",5

bumGenius Diaper Sprayer,"This is really useful for cloth diapering.  I know we *can* put poopy diapers in the washing machine, but I just feel better if most of the poop is rinsed off first.  Plus, the diapers come cleaner more easily when you use this.We've had two significant issues with this: installation and sensitivity.  The installation was not as simple as advertised and this still leaks a little where the hose connects to the sprayer.  Also, the lever that you use to turn the sprayer on and off is extremely sensitive.  There is very little difference in position between 'off', 'dribble' and 'power wash'.  We do have high water pressure at our house, but still!  I can push the button on the handle and barely any water comes out, tap the lever a tiny bit, and it sprays out like the garden hose nozzle!I would still recommend this, but just be aware of the potential issues.",3

"aden + anais 3 Pack Muslin Washcloths, Water Baby","We were given all kinds of other wash cloths for our baby shower, but after using them for a couple of months I found that they were a bit rough on my son's skin.  Having tried other Aden and Anais products, I knew how soft their material was so I decided to splurge and get some of these washcloths.  Since then we have not used any other wash cloths.  They are large and super soft.  They do indeed get softer with each wash.  We actually ended up with a hole in one of our washcloths, and Aden and Anais had wonderful customer service.  They were prompt in responding back to me and quickly sent a replacement.  I would highly recommend all Aden and Anais products!  It is a bit expensive but totally worth it.",5
Baby Trend High Chair Palm Tree,"I have had this highchair for almost two years (different pattern).  It has held up well.  The features that I was looking for in a highchair were:1. easy to clean2. folds3. reclines easily4. sturdy5. 5-point harnessI had a Peg Perego with my first son.  It worked well but I did not care for the leatherette seat.  It was very hard to wash and never looked clean (my sil had the same problem). I did not like how the tray went in, and the tray was hard to fit in my sink to clean.  Also there was this small indent all around the tray where the top of the tray meets the bottom and food would get stuck in it.  You wouldn't notice it unless you were really giving it a good scrub.  I had to scrap it out with my fingernail and it was disgusting.  But there were just too many places on the chair that were hard to clean.  Anyway, it was a good quality product but I didn't have 30 minutes after every meal to clean the chair properly.  When my second son was born I got the graco easy chair which is a very basic chair, it was easy to clean however when my son started pulling himself up on furniture the highchair almost tipped over on him.  It would have had I not been right there.  So, back I went and after reading positve reviews on this chair I bought it.  I must say I was hesitant about buying a chair with a fabric cover, but it washes well and is reversible.  Much easier to just throw it in the wash than having to scub one.  I can't complain about any of the features.  I don't have any problems with how the tray goes in but everytime my sister removes the tray she forgets that it doesn't stop and spills everything on the floor.  One of the pieces that holds the tray on in storage mode has broken.  My husband thinks he can fix it, but I did use that feature quite a bit.  Also,  we recently moved and at our old house we had a newer maytag dishwasher with the tall-tub design and the removable tray fit fine in that but at our new house we installed a Bosch and the tray does not fit in that dishwasher.Overall for the money it is a very good product.",4

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles came recommended to me, and I am glad I invested the money.  There is a reason why the Avent bottles are a little more expensive than competitors.  I'm a breasfeeding mother, however, when my son turned four weeks old, we wanted to introduce a bottle so his father and other family members could feed him, giving me a break.  He took to it right away, and I note that he latches on the Avent nipple like that of mine.  So, if you are a breasfeeding mother who wants to use a bottle part-time, then these should be your choice!  I also don't see my son having a lot of gas issues, and they clean up real easy, too--not like some of the bottles my friends have used.",5

I have not bought sheets for it yet, but I jut put on my regular crib mattress sheet which is too big, but then I safety pinned the extra sheet both together on the bottom so it fits snug and doesn't bunch up. happy with the purchase!",5
Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat - Gray,"Love these. They do exactly what we wanted them to do. I like the pockets at the bottom. My only nitpick is that they don't cover the headrests of each seat and if you have a tall forward-facing carseat (like the Diono), the top of it presses into the headrest. If you have leather seats like we do, it will leave a pretty deep dent that the mat doesn't protect the seat from. Otherwise, great mats. We would recommend them and will definitely get another for baby number 3!",4
"Fisher-Price Ipad Apptivity Seat, Newborn-to-Toddler","people need to get a grip, you're happy to put your kids in front of a TV on the baby channel but heaven forbid a tablet?? My little girl loves the colors on the touchscreen and also loves to see things move when she touches the screen and it did anything but have a bad effect on her motor skill development. If you choose to let this or any device parent your child, you need to take a long hard look at yourself, as that's not what these products are designed for, and if people choose to use said products irresponsibility, that is not in any way the fault of the manufacturer - is it apples fault if i use my tablet to wack someone who's annoying me? No it's mine. Any-who with that said, truly a great product!",5
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"I am actually really mad that I wasted money on this item. We have been running a CD player with rain sounds in our son's nursery for months now. We were getting worried that the CD player might just die, so we thought this white noise machine would do. I was worried about the volume when I ordered it, but other reviews made me think it would be loud enough. NOT TRUE. This thing won't block out ANY NOISE. The puny little speaker is just not big enough. We'll just buy another CD player I guess. The rain sound is also very disappointing and just sounds like crackling sounds. Extremely disappointed.",2

i-UniK Vivitar XO 7-inch Kids Tablet XO-780 &amp; Sakar International Camelio CAM740 Family Tablet PU Leather Protection Case (Light Blue),"It is one of the few cases specifically designed for the XO tablet Vivitar I could find.

Well you can stop horizontally for watching videos or just use it that way.During use, the cover can be attached to the hand, so that no accidental fall.Ah! Did I mention it is genuine leather? So, that means it should last longer than similar products made &#8203;&#8203;of plastic.Overall, my wife, my daughter and I loved the product.",5

This is absolutely perfect for a one and only stroller, it handles all terrain smoothly but has small tires so isn't bulky or heavy.Here is my pros listpros-cost-easy to use sunshade-easy fold, SUPER easy-longer footwell and non adjustable-flat recline-mesh back-good peekaboo windows, 2, plus longer sunshade, crazy long-lighter-bit more narrow-smaller AT forever air tires, good at everything BUT jogging-taller seat back and to sunshade measurement-one handed push even w/ big kids-holds up to 65lbs!-compareable basket to indie, large and easily accessed-super easy to adjust shoulder straps-harder to undo buckle-easy adjustment for reclineour big kid, almost 5 fits really well, better than the city select and the indie definitely.",5
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"Waste of money!!! Every time my son used this potty, I had a big puddle to clean up on the floor and I had to put diaper to prevent this mess.",1
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"I wanted to love these trays.  I have been nothing but disappointed.  I could have saved money and bought other storage containers.  The lids do not fit very snug.  I make food, leave it overnight, and by morning there is frost on the cubes.  Grr.  I immediately transfer to ziploc bags for storage.  I will continue to use them because I am not willing to spend any more.",2
"Dream On Me 4 in 1 Aden Convertible Mini Crib, Natural","Arrived right in time w/ my Amazon Prime account. Great price too!We have a 1 bedroom apartment and space is very limited.This mini crib is PERFECT for our bedroom!All the pieces were there, and they also provided an allen wrench.Its solid wood (not that cheap particle board stuff).The wood feels kinda soft, I'm scared to scratch it.It only takes up 2' x 3' of floor space, and we'll be using it for the newborn (no bassinett for us).It took my hubby about 1 hour to assemble it, I (9 months pregnant) helped with all the little things.We bought the black crib. (I have all white bumpers and bedding ~ I love the contrast).The finish looks great.It came with a 1"" mattress, its pretty much junk (I might just use it as a changing pad around the house).  Looks like it was used to cushion the pieces during shipping.  We wont be using it.  I bought the Dream On Me 3"" extra firm mattress.NOTE: THERE'S WARNINGS ALL OVER THE BOX AND THE CRIB THAT SAY ""DO NOT USE A MATTRESS THAT EXCEEDS 2 INCHES""oops. That extra inch looks fine to me.Highly recommended!I love how it grows with my baby! (newborn, infant, toddler, to twin bed).  HOpefully this will last throughout all those years!",5
Playtex Nurser 4oz with 5 Drop-Ins liners (colors may vary),"I have tried at least a half a dozen other bottles/nipples, but the latex, Playtex bottle/nipple was the first and only one my baby would drink from... and still does! For some reason he did not like any silicon nipples: we tried Tommee Tippee, Breast Flow, Adiri, Avent, Similac... The drop-in system is great because the thin, BPA-free plastic makes it easy and fast to warm the milk. Even better, the Playtex bottles are not as expensive as others out there - so I recommend you try this one before purchasing other, more expensive, options.",5
Graco DuoGlider LX Stroller in Fortune,"Graco DuoGlider LX StrollerNothing but good things to say. First is ease of use, opens and closes very easy, however some parts have to be easily removed in order to collapse fully. For a double, it collapses fairly flat, enough to fit nicely behind the 3rd row seats in my car.  Opens very easily, and rides extremely smooth. I had to get used to pushing something so long, kind of like driving and old Cadillac, the hood goes on forever. Accommodates my one month old in his car seat and 20 month old on her own nicely. The rear wheel locks are independent of each other, and for lazy people like me, this creates a situation whereby I end up only locking one wheel, if they worked in tandem by some connecting mechanism that would probably be better, again for lazy people like me.  For the price, a great acquisition",4
"Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry Diaper Bag, Black","This is hit or miss.  I got this from one supplier and the bag fell apart after one wash.  I returned it.  Then I bought it again from another supplier and it is wonderful.  I don't know if the first one was just defective or if it had to do with the supplier.  Either way, the new one is great!  It doesn't leak and it has a really cute pattern.  The bag is really strong and holds a lot of diapers when hung from a door knob.",4
COZY BABY NASAL ASPIRATOR - This Snot Sucker Cleans Away Baby's Blocked Nose FAST - Its The Best Nasal Suction Tool On The Market To Relieve Blocked Nasal Congestion Quick - No Filters - Washable And Reusable - Great Baby Shower Gift - 100% Money Back Guarantee.,"My friends told me about this nasal aspirator.  It works great but you have to suck really hard and I sometimes lose my breath and get dizzy! :)  Other than that, I'm able to clear my baby's nose well so she can breath better.",4
"Carter's Pink Elephant Lamp Base And Shade, Pink/Choc, 5.5 X 12&quot;",We use this in our daughter's bedroom and it is absolutely adorable & provides just the right amount of light for middle-of-the-night feedings. I can't say enough good things about this lamp. It is cute without being cutesy.,5
"Woolzies 3 XL Wool Dryer Balls ,Natural Fabric Softener",So far these seem to work as advertised. My laundry is dryer faster. It seems to reduce static as well. I do find that taking my laundry out of the dryer as soon as it's dry cuts down on static. There is some noise but it doesn't bother me.  I like having a natural alternative to chemicals.,4
"Naturepedic Organic Cotton Pillow with PLA Fiber Filling, Standard","The pillow has a strong scent, which will requiring treatment/washing. But then, I'm a severe asthmatic, and hypersensitive to scents; i.e., sometimes, folk don't notice a scent in something that smells strong to me.Construction seems very good, and the tag indicates that it is machine washable. It was comfortable.",3
Similac SimplySmart On The Go Powder Cap,"works good to take out on day trips, conveniant , is easy to use. With free shipping was cheaper than wally world and no didnt have to fight traffic to get it",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",Once installed the gate performed well. My issue is with the included hardware. The threaded adjustment devices were garbage. Each one of the four had to be disassembled and run thru a thread chasing die before they would work. If I need another one I will buy a different brand.,3
Peg Perego Prima Pappa Diner in Oatmeal,"I am very disappointed with this highchair. I love the Peg Perego brand and I love their strollers but I HATE this high chair. These are new colors so I couldn't find any other reviews on it but I had to share.The bad points: The chair is extremely hard to clean. You almost need to scrub it with a toothbrush daily. The cover is hard to get on and off too. There are so many cracks and crannies for crumbs and sticky stuff to hide. I take mine outside once a week and hose it off. The tray is WAY too high. My daughter is now 19 months old and it is still too high.When she was a baby it was near her chin. It also doesn't push in close enough making even more of a mess. You will use a highchair for almost 2 years and this one doesn't work for babies or toddlers.The good points: I love that is has the piece between her legs so she can't fall through. That's it.If I could do it all over again, being older and wiser!, I would buy a wooden highchair with the tray that goes up and over and stays behind it. You could put a towel down or cushion and clean it regulary. My friend has one and it's the best. No little cracks for food to hide. Easy to clean.Don't waste your money on this expensive chair. They have to keep coming out with different colors so people will keep buying them. Get a wooden one and get a cool pad for it!",1
"JJ Cole Collections System Diaper Bag, Black Damask","Looks great, lots of functionality, but heavy!  Love the stroller straps. Magnetic pocket in front is awesome. Paci pocket is incredible.",4
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","We bought this to use as a toy, and as a seat to feed our daughter in, and it has worked well for both! I would recommend this chair over a bumbo!",5

VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sounds Full Color Video and Audio Monitor,I connected the monitor to try it out and make sure it works so far it was working great. i left the room and walked around the home to make sure the connection did not drop but the signal is very strong. i am very please with the product.,5
Baby Care Play Mat - Pingko Friends (Large),This play mat is easy to clean and really saves my knees with all the play time with baby. Thick and cushioned and bounces back right..,5
Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP Convertible Booster Car Seat - Crystal,We needed a convertible for our 3 month old as he hated his infant seat. He is also 15 lbs so lugging him around wasn't an option anymore. We love this car seat. It is super easy to install. The buckles are easy to release and so is the tighening mechanism. It takes up less space front to back than our Keyfit did.,5
Aquaus Toilet Bidet Handle / Diaper Sprayer with ** BONUS ** Rockin' Green Laundry Detergent and Tooth Tissue sample,"After reading all the reviews I decided to spend a bit more and go with this product. Let me just say that I've never seen instructions so well thought out and easy to read and understand. Whoever wrote them is a great communicator and really understands how different people process information. For example, there were color pictures with the name of each part as well as a letter for each part, so there was no mistaking how to put this thing together. Also I love the valve feature, it allows you to control the flow of the water to the pressure you want. It is not cumbersome at all to turn it off and on each time you use. And it prevents those water leaks other products have. An unexpected bonus is cleaning.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Holds up great i got this when my son was 5 months old and now he is 3 and still using it he and i both love it,5
"100% Cotton Canvas Shoulder Tote w/ Multiple Pockets, Black, IMPROVED!","Sturdy canvas bag.  The pockets are handy for bottles, not too tall so loading is easy.  No printed advertising!",5
Summer Infant Extra Camera for BestView Handheld Color Video Monitor,I use this for keeping an eye on my 93yr old Mother who lives with me. Works beautifully day or dark night. Compared to Samsung system and picked this one for better picture and sound quality.,5
"Boppy Cottony Cute Slipcover, Emily's Garden","The Boppy Cottony slip cover was just that, &#34;Perfect and Comfy.&#34;  I liked the color  too, and the shape was most helpful for my sore hip.",5
Tiny Love Crosby Clip-On Crab Stroller Toy,So cute.  Every grandmother will want one.  Perfect shower gift for Grandma.My 3 month old grandson really loves it.  Lights and music.,5
Combi Transition High Chair/Table And Chair Mango,This high chair is great. it cleans up well and is a breeze to put together and it is really sturdy. first we bought a highchair at walmart and it was so cheapt that we took it back and then ordered this one online. the only bad thing about it is the buckles to b uckle them in. they are extremely hard to use...way too stiff. i have pinched my fingers numerous times where they actually bled.  my daughter has also had her finger pinched in it...i almost think there should be a recall on these buckles for this exact reason.  if it can make my finger bleed its way too dangerous for a baby.,4
"Medela Breastmilk Collection and Storage Bottles, 5 Ounce","First things first: the bottle accomplish the basic function i.e. storage.  Yes, they can be frozen and survive well in the deep freezer.  They fit with both pump kit styles (medela and ameda), which is a huge plus.  So here are the negatives:These bottles work with Enfamil Nipples - another plus1) many of the Medela style bottles have raised graduations in both ounces and milliliters on the side.  When the bottle contains milk it is very difficult to read the volume from the graduated scale because there is insufficient contrast against the liquid to break out the small numbers.2) some Medela bottles overcame this problem by using a colored scale and this allows you to read the volume from the bottle. However, the fidelity of the graduations is very course in that it reads every 25 ml where every 5 ml would be significantly better for measuring out feeding amounts.  Therefore, we are always transferring breast milk to another bottle to determine precisely how much we are feeding our little one... as a preemie this is probably more significant a problem than with a full term baby.",2
"Summer Infant 3D lite Convenience Stroller, Black",Loved it at first but then I noticed the front wheels would lock making me trip over the stroller and it bends really easily so it makes the stroller steer all stupid.. I would not recommend this I'm in search for a new stroller,1
"Evenflo AMP High Back Car Seat Booster, Pink Angles","Have had this for 2+ years and still going strong.  It is great for my 5 year old (was tall at 4) and it is easy to fit in the car, transfer to other cars and clean.  The cup holder on each side is awesome.",5
Dr. Brown's Gia Nursing Pillow,"I started out with the Boppy pillow which after a couple of tries, I gave up on due to it not allowing my baby to be at an incline during nursing. The Gia pillow has been much better. It's so comfortable we often fall asleep together with my arms and babe propped on the pillow.",5
"Ah Goo Baby The Bib, Zoo Frenzy","I love the Ah Goo Baby bibs.  They are cute, fashionable, and i especially love the magnetic closure.  I don't worry about keeping a bib on my kid when we are driving a car because I know if she were to yank on it, or if it were to get caught on something, it would simply slip off her neck due to the fantastic magnetic closure.  I have one of each pattern, you know, so that they can be matched with a variety of outfits.  Not only are these bibs super fashionable, they are quite absorbent.  I don't even really use burp cloths when I am with my infant in public anymore, I just use the bib instead.",5
"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","Let's face it... many of us do a ton of research on carseats, and I am no different.  After carefully reading reviews, asking my friends, and getting my wife's input, we finally settled on this Chicco KeyFit 30 and we are quite happy we did.  We have a lot of friends who bought the Grayco/Greyco (sp?) equivalent who have seen, felt, and used ours (briefly) and commented on how much better the quality is.  The features are basically the same, from what I understand, but the materials and build quality are (without question) superior on this Chicco model.If you're suffering through endless reviews, you have a little one on the way (or perhaps, already a little one at home), and you absolutely cannot make a decision, save yourself a little grief and buy this one.  I was so stressed about getting the exact right model, and although I cannot promise you that this is the best one, it has met all of our needs and I haven't met a single person who thought their model was better... only a friend who has the same model in a different color who thought hers was prettier.  ;)  She might be right...Anyway, my wife, my daughter, and I are all happy with this carseat... my daughter is comfortable in it (plus like most infants, she loves car rides) and that is a big part.  I also think it's safe and will do what it is designed to do in the case its safety features are ever called to do their duty.",5
"aden + anais Muslin Stroller Blanket, Jungle Jive",This blanket was much larger then expected.  Super soft and the designs are adorable.  For both little girls and boys.,5
Mother Earth Baby Bottom Better Diaper Salve,"Great for eczema, bum rashes and on the go in the diaper bag!",5
"KF Baby Diaper Bag Insert Organizer (12 x 6.4 x 8 inch, Khaki) + Diaper Changing Pad Value Combo",I love this item. My diaper bag was a mess of materials. It is so much easier to find everything now. This is great for the highly organized mom.,5
Kolcraft Contours Classique 3-in-1 Bassinet in Moda,"The bassinet looks great in the picture, however the color of the fabric is somewhat dull and mine was dirty in several places. The baskets are not as sturdy but they will serve a purpose. Overall it is a good bassinet. I just wish it would swing/rock.",4
"Comotomo Silicone Baby Teether, Blue","My baby's favorite teether! I introduced this to my son at 5 months and as soon as I took it out of our sterilizer he grabbed it right out of my hands! Into the mouth it went and has been a favorite ever since. We have the orange one (beautiful bright citrus color) he prefers brightly colored toys so I'm sure the color has a little bit to do with his interest in it. It is the perfect size for him; he never gags on it, he can hold onto the ring with both hands, and can manipulate it quite well.Some have mentioned their child's interest in the baby banana more than this teether. The baby banana is a baby &#34;tooth&#34; brush. No where in the product description says it is made to be a teether and some who have let their children use it as a teether have made comments about the &#34;bristles&#34; coming off. I have this &#34;tooth&#34;brush as well we use it for hygiene ONLY. The Comotomo teether on the other hand is used for teething (obviously :)  and we LOVE it!",5
Under the Sea Tropical Fish Nursery/Kids Room Wall Art Sticker Decals,I bought these to place on the nurses window at our elementary school.  The kids and staff enjoy them.  The fish actually look like they are in an actual aquarium.  They are fun,5

Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter loves this product but the long legs can be a choking hazard. Please be careful because my daughter loves to chew on this toy.,5
"Dexbaby Nursery Organizer, White","Having twins, I go back and forth between them having the same and then different size diapers. This caddy helped me have another place for the other size when needs be. And I love having somewhere handy for the wipes to go, as opposed to having them on the table itself. And all the other compartments for creams, diaper changing pads, etc.Reason for not rating five stars...it would have been nice if the space for the wipes was a bit deeper so the wipes box wasn't as easy to dislodge.But I still love it, none-the-less.",4
One Step Ahead Stay-Put Inflatable Bed Rail Set,"One side still works, so for that, I give it 3 stars and I still prefer it over the railing so I guess it's just okay. Now I need to repair it with a patch. What will happen next month? Maybe I should just return it.",3
Squatty Potty 7&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"A lot of wild claims were made about this product in a huge advertising blitz. I don't feel it helps me eliminate more thoroughly, and it makes wiping awkward if I don't get off it first. It doesn't leave my anus any cleaner after bowel evacuation. Initial use was awkward but worth the trouble.I tried using this instead of the toilet seat. -The first time I had splatter poops: a piece got out on the floor despite my butt being slightly in the bowl.  -Now I use the seat for splatter control.The product is surprisingly sturdy and light. I weigh about 210lbs and feel comfortable on it.What this product does is; it gets me to squat daily. -That's what I like most about it! You're not going to drop a 5lb deuce, eliminate the need for a seat, or make pooping easier; unless you already know you need to get your feet up to ease elimination.  Forget the advertising blitz claims. -If you really want this item; you'll likely already know it.",4
"Lillian Rose Cotton Christening Baby Bib, White, 8.5&quot; x 9&quot;","The Cake topper we ordered looks nothing like the quality in the picture.  I think it looks cheap and poorly made.  I am not using it for my cake and was very disappointed.  The """"crystals"""" look like embellished stickers.",2
NameTrain Engine,"This is a beautiful engine-shaped Name Train vehicle that can be added on to your other letter-shaped Name Train vehicles as the lead locomotive. It looks great, it feels great, and it rolls great. 5 Stars",5
Redmon Original Canvas Bongo Bag,This bag serves the intented purpose of storing my linens.  I just didn't know that it was going to be smaller than I thought.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,This is the best toy I've bought my baby. She absolutely loves this jumperoo. She can play and jump in it for hours. I would highly recommend this jumperoo to all moms.,5
The First Years Fast Heating Travel Warmer,"I tried three other travel/car bottle warmers before I found this one, and it is by FAR the best warmer I found.  It heated bottles in about 15 minutes, so a little planning is needed, but it helped us survive a 12.5 hour car ride with a nine-month-old without incident.  I recommend this bottle warmer to all my mommy friends!",5
"Wee Gallery Art Cards for Baby, Sea Collection","I bought these cards for my 4 month old daughter.  I put three of them on the wall above her changing table and three on the wall next to her crib. This way she can look at them when she's getting changed and laying awake in bed.  I can't say that she stares at them constantly, but as she gets older, we can talk about the animals as she's getting changed.  I also just love them because they are adorable on the walls.  Great quality.",4
Sorelle Dondola Gliding Cradle - Natural,"This cradle is far superior to any of the others I've seen.  The wood is sturdy and the gliding mechanism smooth.  The finish (natural) is gorgeous.  We've used it without the caster wheels since we didn't want to scratch the floor, but the height is still perfect for us.  It went together very easily.  I feel very safe letting my baby sleep in this cradle.  It just feels more substantial and sturdier than many others.",5
bumGenius One-Size Snap Closure Cloth Diaper 4.0 - Bubble,"I bought this diaper just to try - I needed some overnight solutions for my LO, and have heard positive things about BumGenius. This gets the job done, but I'm not all that fond of the flap pocket closure. I'll still use it, but it's not going to be my go-to diaper I also tried pocket diapers from Alva Baby, and ended up ordering those. The care instructions were much simpler, and the diapers are about 1/3 the price (if you get the plain-Jane style). They have a great guarantee, and it won't be a big deal if I have to replace a few down the road. My hubby, who has no idea which brand was which, also picked the diaper from Alva Baby. We're waiting for our new stash to come in the mail.",4
Econobum Full Kit,I cut the prefolds into thirds and serged the edges so that I could use just 2 at a time.  When I try to use the entire prefold it makes the diaper a mile thick.  I like to use a microfiber insert on top as a quick absorber and then back it with 1 or 2 of the econobum pieces I made.  It is really super absorbant and does not suffer compression leaks like microfiber alone does.  Putting them together is a great combo.,3
"Luvable Friends Waterproof Feeder Bib with Crumb Catcher Pocket, Ice Cream",This is an adorable bib.  Seems like pretty good quality at a low price.  Recommend this to keep your baby clean!,5
"Skip Hop Changing Pad Cover, ABC",It's nice and soft but doesn't fit we'll over my summer infant changing pad. Very stretched over the pad so doesn't lay flat,3
Animals Wooden Ceiling Mobile,"This mobile is exactly what we were looking for.  It is a simple design, but the animals are colorful and it does the job of giving our daughter something to focus on when she is falling asleep.  Plus, as she gets older, we can learn animals and colors with it.  Set it up with an orbiter motor and it works perfectly.",5
"Britax Chaperone Stroller, Red Mill","I have been using this stroller since October 10 when my son was born, it is now not even 3 months later and the stroller is broken. Ever since I've owned it the wheels have made noises. Today while walking in town the wheel just fell off while my son was in the carrier. I would not recommend this stroller, I think it's unsafe. I did call Britax and they did say that they would send me new wheels, well great! In the meantime I have a broken stroller",2

Fresh N Freeze 2 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 12-Pack,"This is a great product, I would suggest buyin. It is BPA free, a good size portion for a 1 year old and it seals pretty well, if it's not overstuffed and stacks on top of each other in the freezer to conserve space.",5
Sassy Water Pop Up Organizer,"I ordered a group of these storage devices for my daughterfor my grandkids toys or clothes.

"Trend Lab Fleece CribWrap Rail Covers for Crib Sides (Set of 2), Natural, Narrow","These covers fit perfectly on my crib. I am not sure why the other poster had a problem with them scrunching up. For my crib, it ties perfectly on the outside of the last spindle of each rail...keeping it securely taught.",5
"Friendly Toys, Little Playzone with Electronic Sound and Lights","We purchased this product for our 1yr old son. This product looks very nice in our living room,and my son loves it too. It has music and lights for him to play. I suggest getting two sets rather than extensions, the two sets make a perfect size for a living room. This product is very sturdy and safe for little ones.",5

Carter's Jungle Jill Lamp Base and Shade,"This product is a nice simple night light. I use it just before I read a bedtime story to my daughter. It's just enough light to read to her, but not too bright that she can't fall asleep in.",5
Playtex Disney Princess Insulator 9 oz - 2 Pack (Styles May Vary),"I too like these cups with the exception that the design scratches off.  This started happening immediately when my daughter started using them.  After about 6 months, most of the design was gone leaving just enough to make the cups look extremely worn and old.  I didn't want to buy new sippy cups because they don't leak and are otherwise great cups.  I eventually ended up gently rubbing a green pot scrubbing pad over them to get the remaining paint off of them.  Sadly, my daughter just has plain pink and purple cups with no princesses now!",3

I expect this to continue to be useful for quite some time since it adjust to other positions.",5
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","We took 2 of these strollers to Orlando.  They were great at the airport, Disney and Sea World!  They also work really good with the stroller connectors.  We were able to hook them together for a double stroller and they gave our kids (2 and 5) more room than the Jeep double umbrella we had prior.  The shades were ample and the strollers were comfortable for my 2 year old to nap in.  Saw some other babies in regular umbrella's all hunched over in their non reclining seats and felt so bad for them!  The storage was just enough to be helpful.  I purchased a pink and green one and love them!  My husband who is mr. picky had no complaints (big surprise!).  The strollers were tall enough to be comfortable for him to push.  They were a tad wide to fit into some of the entrance gates but they are so light that he just lifted them right up.  Our green one had the wheel wobble people talked about but it went away after some use and we didn't notice it at all when the 2 strollers were connected.",5
Gerber Baby Bottle 5oz Fashion Tints (Two 3 Packs),the nipple to this bottle is perfect for a newborn or a premie ( i have a premie and he loved this nipple) i am very happy with this product,5
Safety 1st Lift Lock and Swing Gate,"These gates are wonderful! I have been using them for atleast I think 4 months or more. My husband and me installed using hardware that way they could swing!!

"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","When I first started using a sleep sack I really liked it because my child loved to be rapped up. Now I will never use one again. Don't be fooled, your baby can still suffocate wearing one of these. Yesterday I bought the medium sleep sack do to the fact that my child out grew his small one. While he was sleeping he somehow got the sleepsack up over his nose. If I hanldnt woken up, he very easily could have suffocated. I will never use any type of sleep sack again. The risk is to much. Just because sleepsack fight SIDS, doesn't mean it isn't the cause in some cases. Be very careful using a sleepsack! They most definitely are not risk free!",1

Other bibs I've tried are too big around the neck for my 0-2 month old, or the formula actually soaks through the bib. My only complaint is the Velcro isn't very sticky and tends to come undone.",4
Sesame Street Teether Baby Rattle Toy,Beatiful  and pretty nice. My baby loves it. You can hang it both in any place. I recommend it pretty much.,5
Prince Lionheart Balance Bike,I found the assembly quite simple.  I received it in perfect condition and I appreciated the allen wrench that was provided.  My little one got a real thrill learning to balance.  I found the bike to be constructed of pretty solid material.,4
B.box Essential Sippy Cup in Blue - 6 Oz,Love this cup!!! Our toddler uses it all the time :-) We've tried several cups with straws and they've always leaked out everywhere. This one does not do that and he carries it around with him all over the place.,5
"Aprica Presto Stroller, Metro Orange","I paid around $90, so I can't really complain, b/c the price point for the features it contains was what I was looking for.  I normally don't write reviews, but for this particular item, I thought I would give other parents my opinion. I have two other strollers, a Peg Prego(Pliko) and a Maclaren (Volo).  The reason I am getting the second umbrella stroller is because The Volo DOES NOT RECLINE, the Pliko is too heavy so I bought the Volo.  I have two children a three year old and a one year old.  The older one rides in the Volo and the younger one rides in the Aprica.PROS:* This  stroller reclines, unlike the volo.* Reasonably light weight 13.7lbs , although the volo is lighter at 8.8lbs* Great for tall parents, the handles are high and the foam padding is nice.  I'm 5'5"" inches, for me the handlesare bit high, but if you are tall you will love this stroller* Baby sits higher than most strollers, allowing for better view also less bending for the parents when your placing your child in the stroller* There is a small basket, it's not huge, but there is a place to squeeze some diapers,  wetnaps, snacks* When you close the stroller it stands upright, so long as you have locked the front wheels, so your not looking for a wall or something to lean it up against* Larger sunshade than most umbrella strollers, there is an additional flap that gives even more coverage.  Major issue with the canopy is it DOES NOT rotate forward, so if the sun is in front of you than there is nothing you can do.  With the Volo, it's a smaller umbrella, but b/c you can rotate it forward, you can adjust coverage.  This is probably  my MAJOR complaint with this stroller.  I was thinking about pinning/clipping  a thin blanket in front.  I have yet to do so, because the errands/walks are short, but if  I was to go to Disney or Florida vacation than I definitely would pin something on.* 5 point harness, great safety, but there's another design flaw see negatives* Raincover included* Peekaboo windowNEGATIVES:* No cup holder or tray for snacks* To close the stroller it's a bit tricky, but with practice you can do it with one hand, though as one of the reviewers commented on trying to catch a NYC bus, you would have to close the stroller before the bus arrives, it not just snap and go.* Sunshade does not ROTATE FORWARD, nor can you fully remove it to easily clean.* 5 point harness, the design STINKS, what were they thinking, you have to click the top of the strap into the bottom, before snapping it into the lock.  So they made a two step process into four, RETARDED.  What I have done is permanently tapped the top portion to the bottom to make it into two step process.  I also noticed that when my baby reclines the straps tug a bit, so I have to try to readjust her.  But if I move the strapes to level 2 than it would be chaffing her by the neck and ears, this is another design flaw, the straps aren't long enough.  If your baby is tall, you might have problems with her in the recline position.  I originally had the straps on level 3 since my older girl is bigger, but noticed it was chaffing the baby, so moved it back to level 1, which is perfect when she is seated upright, I just have issues when she's rclined.* Another MAJOR complaint, because of the position of the brakes on the rear wheels, when going down stairs you will AUTOMATICALLY put the brakes on.* There is also a padded piece on the strap that goes between the baby's legs which slides off easily. To fix this you can use a safety pin to permanently attach it, but for myself I just took it off.Overall for the price I paid I can't complain, I wanted an umbrella stroller at a reasonable price that reclined.  The design of the brakes and sun shade not rotating fwd are my two MAJOR complaints everything else is manageable. If money isn't a constraint than look for a better stroller. But if your budget is this price pt, it's not a awful stroller.  Hope this review helps to clarify some features you should look at when buying your stroller.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I just purchased a Sophie for my 6-month-old son after liking the one I saw at my sister's house. While mine looks the same, it is FAR more sensitive as a squeak toy than my sister's is!! I am not a fan of super noisy, annoying toys, so I'm less than thrilled that this one squeaks LOUDLY if you so much as bump it.  The one that my sister has must be squeezed very hard to make a noise.  Not so with mine.The rubber is great.  I like everything else about it.  But I wish I could figure out a way to disable the squeaker.",3
"Jeep Overland Limited Jogging Stroller with Front Fixed Wheel, Fierce","Picked this up when it was recommended by friends.  Very easy to put together, folds nicely, and I love the easily removable wheels.  This is getting me out to the park more (:  Perfect for what I was looking for.",5
Skip Hop Duo - Cord-Chocolate,"I would love this bag if it were flipped around and the side was the top.  As designed, it is too long to comfortably carry as a bag.  It would work on a stroller, however.  Who wants that many separate bags, though?!",3
Graco Bumper Jumper in Twist 'n Shout,"We were so excited to try a jumper for our son, but were very dissapointed in this product. First of all, he tipped himself right out of it!  With the three strap design, it's unsturdy in the back, which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor. He seemed pretty intent on jumping, so now we've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he's nice and snug, but it's still unstable and wobbly. I don't recommend this product, and in fact, we are going to try a different brand.",1
"Summer Infant Prodigy Infant Car Seat, Blaze","This car seat seemed like a great buy.  We bought it at BuyBuyBaby and were educated on the engineering that went into it by the staff there.  It has some of the best padding that would make our arriving baby comfortable, The colors of the seat are great as well.  I bought the travel system, and it was very easy to assemble.  I got the base out and was excited to try its function. I went out to my truck and got the seat belt ready to go (I have a truck that has no latch due to it's weight)I tried to make sense of the ratcheting system and couldn't figure it out.  After reading the instruction manual again and still not quite understanding what I did wrong I called.  After a little time on the phone and two associates telling me it was user error and I just had to to what they told me, I sent them pictures and they realized that I wasn't doing anything wrong.  Turns out all of the engineering that went into this seat was counteracted by the poor QC team there.  This all happened on a Friday morning.  I then didn't hear back from them so I tried to call back that afternoon, they wee closed for lunch, again in a few hours, closed for the weekend, again on Monday, too busy(waited 35 minutes no answer, again Monday afternoon, lunch.  Finally I got a hold of them and they informed me that they could send me a new base, but I had to send mine back first! After reminding the woman that I had a baby on the way and not sure when she will arrive she agreed to send me a base first then I could send mine back.Overall the seat seems great. Outstanding crash test ratings, gel like seating area, extra infant padding.Most people would not have noticed that this base was made incorrectly but since my truck uses the middle belt, this issue rendered my base and seat useless until I get a new product. On the same note, the customer service section is not open during convenient hours for anyone that works for a living.  Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST with a 1 hour lunch from 12:30-1:30.  To me that is a lack of concern toward their customers.If the baby comes before this is resolved I will be returning the seat and stroller and buying a Britax.UPDATE:After the first few outings we really liked weight and comfort of this seat for the baby.  However, the stroller does not roll straight and if you are any surface but carpet, the steering is almost impossible.  The tires (like many now) are made of foam and if the stroller is used outside they get shredded making traction next to impossible.  We now have this travel set, and a Britax stroller and convertible car seat.My recommendation would be to buy whichever set meets all of your standards in compromise, for me this one met some but failed on others. I looked just for safety ratings and ended up spending almost $2000 in strollers and car seats getting what works best for me.",2

"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary",I'm not familar with other brands but this works well enough for me. I use filtered water since it will gunk up quickly inside using tap water. I also have to keep a close eye on the bottle because it will go from slightly warm to hot very quickly.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"The King of baby gates. I almost didn't buy this because consumer reports didn't rate it well especially on the safety dimension. I don't know what they were smoking, because this is an awesome baby gate. It is so easy to get through yet it is solid and kid proof. I was afraid that the little one would be able to depress the foot pedal. NOT SO. My one year old can't budge it. My three year old can move it a little, but not anywhere enough to open it. My six year old has to jump up and down on it a little, but can open it. For me, no handed operation is a dream come true. Perfect gate.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Sea Dreams","All parents should be forewarned that the braking system in this product is misleading.  It seems like as soon as your child hits a different level, be it stairs going down or a raised kitchen floor, the walker automatically stops. We tried really pushing it down the stairs ourselves numerous times and it wouldn't budge. It seemed so safe.  The concept of brakes lulls you into a false sense of security. Today our son pushed his walker down the stairs and fell the 6 steps in it!!  It was a horrifying experience and although he turned out to be fine, he could have been badly hurt. Obviously we shouldn't have let down our guard and we should have had a gate up.  But I wanted to make sure no other well meaning parents would be mislead by this product's brakes.",1
"Evenflo Classic Johnny Jump Up, Frogs","had over a year and still in great/new condition and my daughter is &#34;frank the tank&#34; so we've nick named her. she is rough, and this has survived :) she uses it all the time and loves it. all tho when she was younger (2.5 now) it would have been nice to have a tray for toys as she seemed to get bored, we did hang some toys from the loops and that helped. great buy, we are happy :)",5
"Britax Boulevard 70 Convertible Car Seat, Silver Birch","Before my daughter was born in 2010, I bought the Roundabout 50 Classic, assuming that it would last her until she was in a booster seat.  She ended up outgrowing her infant seat at 6 months instead of the typical 9-12 month range, and now at 18 months she is off the charts for height and weight, so I was worried she would outgrow the Roundabout before we were ready for a booster seat.  When I found out I was pregnant with #2, I knew we would need another carseat, so I decided to purchase the Boulevard.  I was actually torn between the Marathon and the Boulevard, but for an extra $30 I thought the True Side Impact Protection with the head wings was worth it and bought the Boulevard.I truly love both seats.  The Boulevard is definitely more of a luxury seat compared to the Roundabout. It's much heavier too.  I would definitely never use it for air travel, as it would get quite heavy to carry in the airport.  I have traveled with the Roundabout in the airport with no issues though, it is easy to carry. Also, the Roundabout doesn't have comfort covers around the harness straps, so for younger infants that could pose a problem with the straps chaffing against their tender skin. The Roundabout also doesn't have any type of head rest or support, so for long trips it definitely wouldn't be as comfortable as the Boulevard.  I also like that the Boulevard can recline while in the forward facing position.  The Roundabout doesn't have this option (you can only recline in RF position).  They are both easy to install and the procedure for installation is exactly the same for both seats if you are using the LATCH system.  You just snap in the connectors and attach the versa tether to anchor everything down.  It's super easy.  I am 7 months pregnant and easily uninstalled the Roundabout and replaced it with the Boulevard in 5 minutes.A couple other features that I am excited about with the Boulevard-- the cover comes off for washing without uninstalling the carseat.  My daughter threw up ALL over her Roundabout last fall and it was a true pain to disassemble and reassemble the seat to be able to wash the cover and all the straps.  I'm hoping this process will be much easier with the Boulevard, should we have any more unexpected accidents. Another feature I love is the harness height adjuster.  You literally just press a button and it adjusts the harness height!  This is great if you carpool or tote other kids around.  No more uninstalling the seat and hassling with rethreading the straps like we had to do with the Roundabout.The only thing I am a little concerned about with the Boulevard is the head wings bothering my daughter.  They are very bulky and extend outwards to the point where it will most likely obstruct her view on the left and right sides.  This could be a problem for some kids.  But, I'm hoping it is not a problem for my daughter...it seems like they will provide nice support for if she wants to take a nap, so maybe that will offset the fact that they are so large and bulky.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase of the Boulevard and am hoping it will last (weight and heightwise) until she is ready for one of the Britax boosters.  We plan on giving the Roundabout to our new baby when he is ready for it.  I truly love both seats, but if I had to do it over again, I would probably like either two Boulevards or a Boulevard and a Marathon, as they are able to accommodate up to 70 pounds, which means more bang for your buck in the long run.",5
Via Velo Montalban 3 Bike Trailer with Jogger Kit,"I had the same experience as the author of the other review about the seems coming apart.  My kids are small and well below the weight limit, yet the seam that holds the seat to one side of the trailer has completely torn.  The geniuses at the lab failed to support the middle of the seat where the majority of the weight is centered, save for some lousy stitching.  Also the thing squeaks and creaks like crazy when I ride, while I have not had it long and lubed the heck out of it to no avail.  Save yourself some money and frustration and go with a less expensive better quality trailer with better reviews.",1

Baby Brezza Formula Pro One Step Food Maker,"I gave it two stars because it is a neat concept. However, after two uses (the first use being the sterilizer) the heater went out. I was so excited to have it after making the first bottle because with the touch of a button I had a perfectly heated bottle in seconds. But as others have stated, I'm not so sure the formula to water ratio was correct. The bottle that the formula pro made looked like watered down milk and the hand made bottle looked like I poured milk from a jug. Again, it is a really neat concept that has some kinks that need to be worked out.",2
"Dream On Me Classic 2 in 1 Convertible Stationary Side Crib, Cherry",I have had this crib for almost a year now and still no complaints. I know my son is safe in it and i can tell that its built of quality material because it can handle the ware and tare of a growing boy. I especially like the rail protector because my son oftentimes bites on the rail and i know hes not eating paint. I would recommend this item and seller again.,5

"Munchkin Folding Step Stool, Blue","I ordered this stool for my grand daughter to use when she visits.  It folds up and takes up little space when not in use, yet it is sturdy and not at all tippy.  It is light weight so she can move it to where she needs it.  She loves the pink color and I love that the base is wide and the top is big enough for her to stand on comfortably.  All around excellent product.",5
"Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Black","I have the Skip Hop Duo in Blossom. Kinda sporty style, mod & pretty, too! I'm pregnant with my 2nd child & have an almost 2 yr old. My kids will be 21 months apart. I did not research diaper bags with my first baby. I just bought or registered for what I liked and seemed affordable. I wound up with a beautiful laptop-looking herringbone dipe bag from Wal-Mart that was huge & when slung over my shoulder, the straps were too short! I'm 5ft. 1 in. & petite btw. I bought a GORGEOUS Bella Tunno bag from Gap, but it was too large for everyday trips to the store or friend's homes. Then I bought a Land's End tote with monogramming. Classic, could be used later, but my son was walking by this point and after a day at the mall play area, I realized I needed a smaller, hands-free option. I ended up using my free Similac dipe bag from the hospital. As a gal who loves purses, this was functional, but not ideal. I researched like crazy this time from websites to magazines to watching youtube vids (very helpful). It came down to the Serena & Lily Gypsy tote ($164), JJ Cole System 180 ($70-80), JJ Cole Mode ($60) & this Skip Hop Duo.S & Lily was out not only because of the much higher price, but I needed something a bit more practical with pockets on the outside at this point (I still want this bag, though, maybe a Christmas gift!). The System 180 was still a bit larger than what I was looking for, but great for longer trips! The Mode had great reviews, but what sold me on Skip Hop Duo was the built in Shuttle Clips, I never have to worry about forgetting them like with JJ Coles Grips. Plus, I wanted something a bit more streamlined & it looks more like a bag you might take to work (I'm a high school teacher, now SAHM).It's true that once you start filling up the outside pockets, the inside gets cramped, but this forces me to take a bit less. I've packed it for 2 kids already. I keep 4 dipes & change pad in large back pocket, clothes (in bottom)& snacks (on top) in the main compartment and then find places for all the little stuff. The small zip pocket on top is perfect for my lipgloss, sunglasses & wallet (you just have to have a smaller wallet). PERFECT For a run to the store or friend's home. I decided if I'm going somewhere like the zoo, I'll pack this Dipe bag same as above, I always take in a mini softsided cooler for snacks/drinks. Then I'll keep my Land's End Tote in the car stocked for the actual rare emergencies when I need 3 changes of clothes and tons of diapers. The over packing for emergencies is what does me in sometimes, so I'm willing just to keep a tote in the car for the extras that many times aren't needed.Oh and get the pacifier pocket! I love this thing. Frees up more space in the bag. Wish I had one with my son.  Long review! Hope that helps.",4
"Baby Doll Modern Hotel Style Crib Comforter, Ivory",This product is well made and has held up after several washings.  I am very happy with this crib comforter.,5
"Leachco Podster Sling-Style Infant Seat Lounger, Sage Pin Dot","This pillow is super cute. I use it primarily for taking picture of my baby. Most of the time, my baby doesn't like being sunk into the pillow the way it's design. After the purchase, I wish that I consider the other pillows that is more versatile. I cannot reuse this pillow because its design for a purpose. Where as the bobby pillow can be use as a seat cushion later on. For an example, when the little one is on the floor playing, I wish that I have a pillow to lay comfortably next to  my baby",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had put Sophie on my registry, but no one purchased it (I'm guessing the high cost). I knew that I wanted it after reading the reviews, so I purchased it before my baby was even born. My husband thought I was crazy for spending 20 dollars on a little giraffe toy, but he later realized that it was twenty dollars well spent. When I saw my son starting to put objects into his mouth, I knew it was time for the Sophie. This toy has become his favorite toy. No matter where I go, I make sure I have Sophie. It will keep him distracted and entertained for a good time. So in conclusion, bite the bullet and buy Sophie. You'll be very glad that you did.",5
Tommee Tippee Explora Truly Spill Proof Water Bottle - 2pk Girl (Colors/styles May Vary),"These are the worst cups I have ever purchased and I can't believe I wasted my money on them.  First off, they leak. If you don't tighten them with a death grip the moment your child turns it up to sip, the liquid starts drips out around the lid. Second, once you've tightened the lid on there so that it won't leak, good luck trying to get it off. You can't. It's stuck.  I tried running warm water over the lid, using a can gripper and finally just beat the hell out of it on the counter until the finally lid popped off and water went everywhere. Seriously considered getting my shotgun and blowing these SOB's apart I hate them so much!  Don't waste your hard earned money on crap like this. Extremely disappointed in these cups and Tommee Tippee altogether.....",1

The First Years GumDrop Teething Pacifier Teether - 1 Pack (Pink),"This product my son loves! He chews on it constantly because he's teething and its easy for him to grip. The only way this product could not work, is if your child is too old to be needing a passy in the first place. I'm not fond of its color but it does the trick! And its a very large passy too which helps with gripping and his fingers don't get stuck in its holes.",4

Quick Stick Write-on! Child ID Tattoos (Sports),We used these several times on trips to Disney.  We put them under the kids wrist or upper arm under their shirt.  It gives us a comfort if they did get separated they could get back to us easily.  The kids felt the same comfort when we explained it to them.  It is not going to come off by accident either.  They wore them for three days straight and had to be pulled off at the end.  It did hurt little pulling them off.  Someone asked us about them at every line we were in.,5
"Stork Craft Hoop Glider, Espresso/Beige","I don't normally write reviews and was a bit skeptical when ordering this chair however I was really surprised.

It is one of the easiest pieces of furniture ever to put together. There were 8 bolts to complete the chair. The ball bearings are quality as I am 6'4"""" and 235 lbs and the chair holds me and works perfectly with that much weight. Great purchase.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I absolutely love this swing. The feature, which allows you to plug it into the wall, is so nice.

If this swing is an option for you, I highly recommend purchasing it.",5
Go Anywhere Booster Travel Seat - Red/Black,"This seat is a perfect for parents of children for anytime you might be eating away from home.

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",I bought this because it seemed like every time I took my son to someone's house or to a family function I had no where to put him when it was time to feed him.  I was also frustrated every time I took my son to a restaurant and the crouch strap was missing from their chair and he kept sliding out.  I shopped around trying to find a protable high chair and checked many web sites.  I read all of the reviews on the different portable high chairs and this was the only one who had a 5 star rating so I decided to purchase it.  My son loves this chair and so do I!  I take it every where we go including restaurants.  I have not found a chair yet that I can't strap this down to.  I love the fact that I can also use it as a booster seat when he is too big to have the trays on it.  It is very light and easy to carry.  I can carry my 10 month son while having a diaper bag strap and and the chair strap on my shoulder.  The only thing is that my son has figured out how to take the tray and cover off and as soon as you put it on he takes it right back off....but it seems to keep him entertained for very long periods of time and he gets a kick out of doing it.  I love this so much and it is such a great price that I have bought it for 4 baby showers since I purchased mine.  They all love it too!,5

The First Years Breastflow Starter Set,"First of all I must say I really loved this bottles. They taught my baby how to latch on and they really help a lot with colic. However I was terribly disappointed to see that after about 5 or 6 weeks the blue part of the nipple started to give. I own 16 of these bottles and never even got to use the big ones because I had to run and find different ones. The blue nipple on all the small ones started to lose shape so they leaked a lot. I'm guessing it was caused by sterilizing. It's the only reason I can find (I own the first years steam sterilizer). So I tried using the bottles without the blue thing, and yes, the leaking stopped, but then the clear nipple is so soft my baby would just push it in by sucking and I'd have to open the bottle to get it to pop back out, which was very frustrating for both baby and me. It's a real shame cuz, as I said, they are really great bottles at first. I love that they come with a lid to use as milk storage and they are compatible with the first years breast pump (which I LOVE), and I love the little cup that comes with this set that you can pop right under the bottle for on the go formula and the fact that you can stack them and how the bottle cap pops under the bottle too..... if only they would make that blue thing more durable!!!",2

Thomas the Tank Snack 'N Sip Canteen,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it! Drink and snack cup in one.,5
Stork Craft Rochester Stages Crib with Drawer,It says it will ship in 5 to 7 days thats a lie they told me 4 to 6 weeks so i waited 2 months then i finally hear back only for them to say its not coming they dont have any in stock why put something up for sale that you dont have so now im expecting any day now and my unborn baby has no where to sleep thanks alot amazon,1
Keekaroo Infant Insert - Chocolate,This seat fits well in the Keekaroo high chair. It has a nice red color and is soft and comfy. The buckles were hard to unbuckle at first but now I have the hang of it and enjoy it!,5
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot",I like the design a lot but I don't find this kind as easy to use as another one I have. I haven't figured out how to get the clip open with one hand which is key for anyone trying to hold a baby at the same time. The other one I have uses velcro to attach to the pacifier which is easier to get on and off and works great with the nuk ones with the handle but it didn't work with the hospital soothie one so I was glad to have this one at first when we were using that kind. I just don't think we will use it much anymore since I much prefer the plastic clip over the metal clunky one.,3
"Teutonia T-Cupholder, Black","I bought this product based on reviewers that said you needed it and I have never used it. I just put the bottles on the bottom or in the carrycot itself. Waste of money, don't buy.",1
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue","We use this Washcloth for everything. Feeding time, bath time, clean up spills time.You name it and we have used this Washcloth for it.Just remember - One side is rough and the other side is smooth.FYI - The design side is the rough side.",5
Samsung SEW-3036WN Wireless Video Baby Monitor IR Night Vision Zoom 3.5 inch,I purchased this item to monitor my new Granddaughter while she sleeps.  I am very pleased with the quality of the display and the sound.  Don't know how I raised my children without a video monitor. I have had the monitor for a month or so and am well pleased with it.,5
"Fisher-Price Jumperoo, Rainforest Friends","This is a wonderful activity center for toddlers.  Adjustable it provides entertainment for babies, from first sitting up through early walking ages.  Musical, attractive, engaging and good exercise -- it's rightfully popular.This model is actually the second Fisher-Price jumperoo I've purchased.  First came the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo, the original model introduced several years ago, the one with vertical supporting poles and a circular base.  My grandson loved it and then so did his mother, my daughter.  Thus it ended up in their home and a replacement for Grandma's House was in order.  As my wife didn't want exactly the same model, I next purchased this one for roughly the same price.  We are very pleased with both.So what are the differences?  In the original, the Rainforest Jumperoo, the vertical supports are more rigid.  This one, the Rainforest Friends, has a smaller, more triangular base, with curved supporting poles.  This design is more flexible, with all the pieces moving together.  Its looser configuration allows the seat to move somewhat back and forth as well as up and down, a smoother, less jerky movement.  This one has a green hard plastic palm frond for dangling the teether/toy as opposed to a felt frond with a plastic rib for the original.  Other than that they are VERY similar.Other reviewers have complained that this model is dangerous, that their child's safety was at issue.  Obviously its loose jointed construction is intentional.  Being an engineer I checked out this model thoroughly for any tendency to break due to wear, to come unexpectedly apart or to topple due to vigorous use.  I find none at risk.  My grandson gives ours a thorough workout with the pieces moving easily in harmony.Both jumperoos are fine products.  If my other daughter ever gives us cause to buy yet another, I would buy this one.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"If I had not been given a ton of Avent bottles, I would have chosen some other system.  The leaking is terrible!!!  You have to buy the disks separately, you should get them for free because they are absolutely essential.  The only way to mix formula in the bottle or transport liquid is to use the disks in the ring, then switch to the nipple when you are ready to feed.  The only reason I give it a two is because I do like that you can pump directly into the bottle with the ISIS breast pump.  And, I like the sippy cups.",2
Natural Touch Softees Super Soft Teether - Large,"The only negative is that I thought I was ordering pink for a girls gift and received blue.  I wish there was a color option. I had assumed the photo color was the actual color.However, this teether is a perfect size and comfortable to hold for a baby.",4
Fisher-Price Deluxe Infant to Toddler Comfort Rocker Bouncer,"I am nine months pregnant with my third child and knew an infant seat was a must. My kids were never able to bounce themselves, so that feature wasn't entirely important to me. My kids were both long babies and appeared to outgrow their seats sooner than they were through being entertained by them. Also, my son would try to turn over in it and wobble the bouncer, nearly giving me a panic every time. Both highly enjoyed the vibrate feature and the ability to nap or play when convenient. So, without further adieu:Pros:Adorable PatternContemporary DesignGender NeutralLightweightPortableDeep, Padded Seat/High SidesGentle Rocking Ability with Stabilizing KickstandSoothing VibrationEasily WashableEasy To Reach, Removable and Simple Toys40 Lb Weight LimitPossible Cons (not for us):No MusicPrice (on this site)*I bought our seat for $40 at Babies R' Us and they also carry it online! Half the cost, same seat.",4
"Boppy Cottony Cute Slipcover, Emily's Garden","The colors and pattern are pretty and bright. It fits snugly and perfectly around my pillow and looks nice. The downside is that it is thin enough that when my baby spits up the spit up soaks right through the cover and onto the boppy pillow, which is not easy to clean. My boppy pillow has spit up stains and poop stains on it now, so next time I will go for the water resistant cover rather than one that is cute.",3
Nuby Monster 7oz Monster 2 Handle No-Spill Sippy Cup- 4M+,"Really cute sippy cup. My son likes it, but the last few times he's used it , its leaked really bad",2
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","the fit is ok, it kind of bunches/squishes up a bit between the top and bottom, making a little more bulk around the edge of the crib.  Im a little nervous because my little guy sleeps on his side/stomach against the side of the crib (the reason we got the bumper because limbs were sticking out) - and I don't want the extra baggy fabric suffocating him.  I watched the installation video and installed as instructed.  I tried to tighten as well as loosen all of the ties/velcro.  Not as happy as I had hoped, but it's better than his little arms and legs sticking out of the crib for now.  I'll give it a few more days and see if I will keep it on.",3
"Cocalo Soft and Cozy Blanket, Sienna","big,thick, heavy and sooooooo soft, and very nice for the price. You cannot go wrong with this item. Absolutely recommended",5
"The First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce","My baby rejects all bottles and pacifiers and I was hoping he will take this from all the fantastic reviews. However, to my disappointment,  he doesn't take this either, but I must say at least he doesn't spit the bottle out of his mouth like the rest. He simply plays with it refusing to such.",2
Baby Trend Universal Double Snap-N-Go Stroller Frame,"I don't always take my twins out of the house. But when I do, it's always with the Baby Trend Universal Double Snap-N-Go Stroller Frame in combination with the Chicco Key Fit 30 carseats.Seriously, every time we use the stroller we are so impressed with how light and easy it is to maneuver. It makes taking the girls out almost fun. I have found that it is possible to access the under carriage storage while the seats are on - it's tricky but you can unsnap the cloth front panel to open it up. Although I tend to just stuff jackets and blankets through the spaces on the sides. Also, we can strap our Skip Hop Duo diaper bag to the first seat frame (closest to the handle) of the stroller to make sure that important items are easily reached.",5
"The First Years Wave Stroller, Crimson Red",Bought the stroller on August 23 and its now September 8. Product was supposed tp arrive on September 1st.This is a baby item and should have been paid attention to. My baby can come any day now and i wont even have a stroller to take it home in. Very disappointed and dont think i will ever buy from amazon again. Do Not buy from this buyer.,1
"Hudson Baby Printed Blanket with Plush Backing, Pink",This is a great blanket. I like that it's light weight but with the material it is made out of that wind can't get through it. I am constantly getting compliments on it and everyone asking where I got it.,5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,My Grandbaby loves it!  Very entertaining and keeps him busy.  He loves to reach and pull.  The lights make him laugh and kick.  He coo's a lot when he's in the bouncer.  He Loves It!  Great Item!,5
Hello Kitty Garden 6 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set with Bumper by Lambs &amp; Ivy,I got it in the time it said and it is Super cute! No complaints with this product. Perfect for my daughter :),5
"Bright Starts Step Stool, Oval Color varies",This is our daughter new favorite toy! She loves using it to look out the window and for brushing her teeth.,5
"3 Sprouts Laundry Hamper, Deer",My girls love their new hampers and they can easily bring them downstairs which helps me.  I'm considering getting a few more for the beach house.,5
"Tiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friends","Pros:The music is lovely, very soothing, sounds like a musical box. I don't go nuts hearing it for the 100th time.I wanted a mobile for my pack-n-play, there's not a lot of choices out there.Cons:Can't fit in my rechargeable batteries!The switch can be a bit confusing. There are 3 in this order; Off, Music & Rotate, Rotate. I've accidentally left the mobile under rotate several times.Not the cutest design, but the pros compensate this.Overall, I would still recommend this product.",4
3 - in - 1 Feeding Organizer,"I'm currently breastfeeding and I use bottles whenever I need to leave.This organizer was the best out there.I love the fact that the two baskets could be used for the dishwasher since there is a lid stored underneath.The down side is that you could only fit a total of 7 bottles.Avent 9 ounce bottles are not one of them(don't know about the small Avent),but I still put my Avent bottles in it,just won't fit on the bottle holders.Like most parents,I have more than 7 bottles,I store the rest of my bottles somewhere else.",4
Safety 1st High-Def Digital Monitor,"After 12 months of not needing a monitor, we paid $50 for this one at Walmart. Now we wonder how we ever lived without it! Crystal clear, no funky interference, small and portable parent piece. Like other reviewers, we do have to plug it in to charge every night since we have no idea how much battery life it's holding at a given time (it just became routine with our cell phones)- overall a great product!",5
"Britax Boulevard 65 CS Click &amp; Safe Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","I have a 09 VW Jetta and with the front seats lowered it fits better than the Bertini infant carrier. I did have to put a towel below the base so I could get the car seat to lean back further to better fit my newborn. It does not lean back as far for a newborn seat as I like. I guess if you don't have the seat anchors on the bottom seats then this is not the car seat for you. I was the easiest car seat I ever installed, but it does look scary. You just click the things to the anchors, tighten, then adjust the head thing. Really easy!",5
Baby Trend Flex Loc Car Seat Skylar,"We had the baby trend zanzibar travel system with my daughter.  Assuming we were not having more children I sold it and 2 1/2 years later a little boy came along 3 weeks early.  Ordered this and it got here right before we had to bring him home from the NICU.  The seat is wonderful,  I knew I wanted  baby trend.  It's easy to get in and out of the car, the trangle handle at the top is wonderful and the seat is sooo light weight!",5
Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress,"Got two of these for our twin boys, they are lightweight and are good quality. They fit into pour cribs great and are cushy, but firm. Our boys are  almost nine months old now and they are holding up great. I highly reccomend these, and so does Baby Bargains.",5
Trend Lab Paisley Park Musical Mobile,"I order the entire rock angel crib set including the mobile for our baby girl that's due in October. It arrived in a few days and i was like a kid on Christmas morning opening it. i must say it is even more adorable in person, and is made very well! the material is super soft, and the colors are more vivid than they are online! i am so happy with my purchase and me and my husband can't wait to set up her room. we had searched everyone for a baby room set that was more rock and roll style to match our style and all the ones we found had skulls on them( which are very cute) but i didn't want her to wake up to skulls every morning. LOL so this is perfect, and her bedroom set is black and even thought this bedding has a chocolate trim around the pink, it's such a dark chocolate that it still matches with the black crib set. everyone should get this, you will be very happy with it :D",5
&quot;Sweet Legs&quot; Infant Baby Toddler Child Leg Warmers - Red &amp; White Stripe,"Heaven forbid I wash something for my baby. One of them completely unraveled, so it made the pair completely useless.",1
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","I've tried several different swaddles (Aden + Anais, Wombie in different sizes, and another zip version i cannot remember the name of) and this has worked the best.  It will grow with the baby, since there are no zippers, and baby is very comfortable. I like how it allows her legs some movement.",4
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White",So far so good - our daughter hasn't arrived yet so I can't speak to it's absorbancy or anything like that. I will say it washed well and fit our porta-crib perfectly.,4
WubbaNub Giraffe,"I got the giraffe Wubbanub for my daughter when she was 7 weeks old.  She is now 12 weeks old and uses it daily.  She loves to grip the legs and flop it around before trying to get the soothie back into her mouth.  Sometimes she misses and gets one of its horns or ears in her mouth - very cute and works well to satisfy her for a small period of time.  I use the front paws to wipe drool off her chin quite frequently.  I love that you can throw the whole thing into the wash with the baby clothes to give it a good cleaning (instructions are on the tag).  It is easy to clean just the soothie should the nipple touch the ground.  She typically naps on her side and this particular Wubbanub lays perfectly next to her while keeping the soothie in her mouth.  Also, it is quite adorable and I love taking pictures of her while she cuddles it!  I would recommend this product to any parent who uses a pacifier with their child, especially if they are using Avent soothies.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",Love this product! My son will not stay swaddled and this keeps him warm through the night. I also don't have to worry about it getting wrapped around his face. So much safer and easier!,5
Rocker Princess Thank You Cards 8ct,Just what we wanted,5
The First Years Soothie BPA Free Starter Set,"This product is really great it includes everything, but the baby. I bought this as a gift when my niece was born.  Its was hard for me to find this set in stores. This was the brand of bottles on my sisters registry. I do recommend buying the bigger nipples when you order this, because they were hard to find as my niece got bigger and grew out of the 0-3 month nipple. The bottles last a long time. What I liked most about them was that you can attach the bottle top to the bottom as you feed. You can also use the small containers for powder milk/cereal and attach it to the bottom of the bottle. Less clutter and less fumbling with bottle tops. Buy this product!",5
"Chicco Liteway Stroller, Fuego","I think this is a good stroller overall, but here are the Pros and Cons in my opinion for it:Pros:- It reclines all the way and it's a one hand recline- Smooth ride, you can maneuver it with one hand; at least on smooth surfaces- Sturdy stroller- Nice design- Can be folded and picked up with one hand, while holding the baby with the other (opening would be a little more challenging, but doable)Narrow fold- Bigger wheels than most umbrella strollers, so I think it will hold on fine on gravel or less than perfect surfaces.- It doesn't tilt back easily when hanging things from the handles and removing the baby from the stroller.Cons:- It really is not a ""light"" stroller; it takes less space than travel system strollers, but is not much lighter.- Long when folded (not necessarily a con, but it takes length space in the trunk. The width is good.- Small basket, but it fits a small diaper bag or large purse under it.- It only holds up to 40 lbs, but my oldest didn't hit that weight until he was almost 5 and didn't use a stroller anymore (he had an old Chicco model that I really liked, but it is now the stroller that grandpa uses), so I figured it will be the same with my youngest, since he is smaller. If not, I'll have an excuse to buy another stroller ;-)The color is not good nor bad, but it is different than what shows on the website. The website shows a dark orange color, but it really is bright red. To me, living in Ohio, turned out fine because now I have a ""Scarlet and Grey"" stroller for my little buckeye fan.",4
"BenBat Travel Friends On The Go Head and Neck Support, Chic, 0-12 Months",Worked out well for our 4 month baby when we did a trip .I find that it fits well behind the head as well as on the side to prop the head straight .,5
Postpartum Support Girdle Belt w/zipper Support Belly Band Medical-Grade Compression Bellefit,I highly recommend this especially for Csection. It hold everything together and provides you a more comfortable days post Csection,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I bought this trying to save a few dollars and when I received it I thought it felt and looked real junky. After using it for over a week I have to admit I was wrong. I have 2 babies in diapers and the Diaper Champ keeps their room smelling GREAT. It is extremely easy to use and it has the added advantage that one can use ANY plastic bag with the Champ.It is an all around great, helpful and inexpensive product.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have been using these bottles for my 5 month old since she was born.  She was breastfed for the first 2 1/2 months, but we always supplemented or pumped.  Now she is exclusivly bottle fed.I did have a problem with them leaking a few times ( as did my sister in law ) , but I just unscrewed the top and screwed it back on , and everything was fine .  Another time , the nipple had cracked and the formula was pouring out, but a new nipple ( upgraded to a 3 mth+) fixed that problem.  This is my first baby and the only bottles I have ever used , so I don't have much to compare to, but I have been happy with them so far and have just purchased my first Avent cup for my DD.",4
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Feeding Bottle, Polypropylene 2-ounce, 2 Pack",We love dr. Brown bottles.  Realize this is the small 2 pack that we used at hospital and when we came home for likes. Week.  We then got 4 oz bottles.  Make sure you want the smaller bottles before purchasing.,4
"Bummis Fabulous Wet Diaper Bag, Green, Small","I am new to cloth diapering and was looking for a wet bag to use to hold the diapers until I wash them. I didn't want to get a diaper pail, since we are currently only cloth diapering on the weekends. This was an excellent replacement. This bag contains the smell and does not leak. It also comes out of the wash without a trace of smell left. We use Flips, so this bag can hold an entire days worth of inserts (8-10) and covers (3-4). I would recommend getting two if you plan to use them instead of a diaper pail.",5
Piyo Piyo Yellow Baby Nail Scissors,"I had trouble using nail clippers & just filing them took forever, but these scissors work great. I don't have to worry about hurting my little one & it gets the job done fast.",5
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia",This works perfect for our family because it easily attaches to our kitchen bar. We throw it in the wash every 2-3 days and let it hang dry at night and it looks as good as new when we put it back on in the morning.  We like it better than some high chairs because it takes up so much less space and it can be washed (without stuff getting stuck in cracks). The absence of the tray means that you kid learns how to eat off of a real counter. It is very sturdy and we check to ensure the handles are tightened periodically. It is pretty light weight - we can store it under our stroller and we have easily taken with us to restaurants.,5
Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Bottle Newborn Feeding Set,"If your baby is colicie, these are the best bottles to use. Within a day her colic was all gone",5
Munchkin 2 Count Door Knob Cover,Works well enough to keep my very curious 16 month old from opening the door. I'm sure once he gets a little taller he will figure out how to bypass it.,3
"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear",These little cubes are great.  Perfect size for portioning out baby food.  Like that I can make a bunch of food and freeze it!,5
"The First Years True Choice P400 Premium Digital Monitor, 2 Parent Unit","I've looked all over the market and not been able to find a monitor that boasts all the features of this one. 3-way communication between all units is simply fantastic. I saw some of the other reviews prior to receiving this product and noticed complaints about static and poor range but I didn't notice any of these things. I put the main unit in my son's room to give it a test run. My husband stayed in the room while my 5-year-old and I wandered around the house and yard seeing how far we could go. It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't any worse than any other monitor we've had. I was able to go down the driveway and get the mail and go to the garage without losing the signal. I was getting some static at that point but I could still hear everything he said and he could hear me and I decided that was far enough. Again, not really any different from any other monitor I've had.On another note, I quickly noticed that the box claimed the monitor was eco friendly. I'm already rolling my eyes because a lot of companies are hopping on that bandwagon these days even if it isn't entirely true. But I was very pleased to find that the set came with two rechargeable batteries and three adapters. It really couldn't be more simple. The main unit does not include a battery but has the option of using batteries, though this unit will probably always remain in the baby's room unless you're traveling or visiting family, etc. So no loss there. The other two units have the batteries and this allows you full reign of your house without feeling tied to a specific room where the monitor may be. Even more wonderful are the clips that are on the back of each unit so you can easily clip them on your belt loop or pocket and you're not tied down anywhere! I know the idea of batteries isn't a new idea with monitors, but even with batteries, the unit is usually so bulky that you're not going to be carrying it around with you from room to room. This definitely changes all of that and as a mom who gets the bulk of her work done when the kids are napping, I can't state enough how much I love this feature.The really beauty in this set, however, is in the 3-way communication. I can hear baby and she can hear me. That in itself is priceless. I push the button that goes only to the main unit in her room, and she can hear me telling her I'm on my way. I've noticed a huge difference in her behavior and she's much calmer as she waits, rather than wailing until she sees me come through the door. The other nice thing is the other parental unit. If I'm working in my office in the evening and my husband has the other unit, we both hear her and we can communicate quickly and easily about who is going to go get her. I don't have to get up and run across the house to ask him to check on her. I can push the button, ask my husband to go check on her, and within seconds I'm back to work. As a writer, this is priceless. Can't recommend this highly enough!!",5
"Toddler Size Waterproof Bib w/Flip Pocket, 2 Pack, Pink Princess",these are large and they are really large. I say maybe a big toddler can pull it off. my tots are tiny so now I use it only for when we paint. it wipes clean easily and no fuss.,4
"With a butterfly kiss, and a ladybug hug, sleep tight little one, like a bug in a rug! Removable Vinyl Wall Sticker - stickers art sayings quote butterflies ladybugs lady bug nursery girl room baby girls decor decoration decorations decal",Loved it. i could not have asked for a better quality & the poem was perfect for our Grand-daughters birthday,5
"Britax Roundabout 55 Convertible Car Seat, Isabella","I looked around at carseats a LOT, and I'm very happy that we got this one.  It has the features and safety of the Britax brand, without breaking the bank on one of the other models.  I also considered the Marathon and am glad I didn't spend the extra money.  I also LOVE the velcro to hold the straps to the side when getting baby in and out.The clamp system inside gives a much more secure installation when using the lap belt, as we had to.  We bought a cheaper model for my husband's car and it was much more difficult to install securely.  Also, I recommend finding a way to anchor it when rear-facing---in my Saturn Outlook we were actually able to thread it under the 2nd row bench seat and use the anchor behind the seat.  The Versa-tether is very long and accomodated this, and anchoring makes for a much more secure installation in the case of a front-end collision.",5
"Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 2.8 Inch","Having just gotten off of the phone with Motorola customer service, I felt compelled to come leave a review of this product. We originally purchased in August of 2012, and by March of 2013 the sound went out on the parent unit. We were still under warranty, so they sent us a whole new set (monitor and camera).Well yesterday the connector inside the parent unit that the power cord plugs into broke, leaving us without the ability to recharge the unit. Motorola customer service informs me that the one year warranty we were initially covered under is from the original purchase date and that we are no longer covered. This is not great, but it's not a huge deal, and so I ask if I could just purchase a replacement parent unit. Nope, they do not sell just the parent unit by itself, I would have to repurchase the whole system. This is ludicrous to me! I'm not spending another almost $200 when all I need is one piece of the system.I am extremely disappointed in the short life of this monitor and Motorola's completely unhelpful policies.",1
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",My new gate arrived today.  Installation was pretty simple.  Currently I am only using the tension mounted method instead of the permanent method.  I wanted to see how it worked until I actually put holes in the wall to secure it better.  My only issue with it is that it could have had a slightly bigger gate opening.  I am a large man and It is a bit narrow for passing through.  I also find that carrying objects through make it a bit close too.  Overall it is nice looking and certainly and improvement in what I was using.  Nicely made gate.  See how it holds up in time?  First impression is good.,4
BabyGanics Ultra Absorbent Diapers - 80 Ct - Size 4,"Maybe this review is too quick for me to type, but my 23lb 1 1/2 year old son has been using these for the past week (only at night) and it's been good. So far no leaks and the diaper fills up thick (like the Huggies overnights) not in crumbles like the Seventh Generation diapers. Babyganics recommends upping a size for overnight use, but so far size 4 is fine for my 23lb son. Oh and if you have a Target by you, then try buying your boxes there. They are usually 27.99 for this 80ct.",5
"The First Years Spinning Drying Rack, White","I used this drying rack for 10 months while my son bottle fed and it held up well. It is very easy to assemble & I didn't even need to reference the instructions for once!The best aspect of the product is that it holds A LOT of items. Also, you have 2 options regarding where you can store the rack: you can place it on the counter and utilize the draining tray provided or you can place it in the sink and allow it to drain there.The biggest downfall I have found is the instability of the rack. The support rod in the middle wobbles quite a bit. Also, the turn table on the top doesn't fit snuggly around the support rod which causes it to lean to one side. Every time I try to adjust this portion it ends up falling down to the bottom of the support rod, I get frustrated after numerous attempts to reattach it and resort to having my much more patient husband put it back together!Because the rack is a little bit of an eye sore due to its size, I have chosen to place it in the right half of my sink in order to limit its visibility to visitors. This method has proven to be functional and allows us to wash/dry a large quantitiy of items at one time.Overall, if you are looking for a rack that holds a large quantity of items (bottles, nipples, pacifiers, spoons, etc) and is relatively inexpensive this will get the job done in its own wobbly way. However, if you are looking for more stability (ie. glass bottles) or need less room for drying there are other products sold on this website that will better meet your needs.",3
Personalized Pacifiers Princess in Training Pacifier in Glitter Pink,loved it,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Nipple Protector, Standard","I was struggling immensely with the pain of breastfeeding. So much so that I would sob every time our little girl latched and fed. It was horrible for our experience and for my husband to sit by and watch. Using a nipples shield changed everything! Our baby is now ten weeks old and I still use the sheild and experience no pain. I will continue to use it the entire time I feed her. I feel like she is able to get more milk with it and that her and I are able to bond and enjoy the experience of breastfeeding more. I use Lansinoh and The First Years lanolin free nipple butter after every feeding as well. The combination of everything kept me from giving up on breastfeeding and/or suffering through the pain. Added bonus, baby took a bottle instantly. I believe this was in part due to the similarity between sucking on the shield and a bottle nipple.",5
"Baby Brezza Temperature Control Kettle, White/Grey",So happy I purchased this...never have to worry about heating up the water to hot in the microwave and don't have to worry about heating the actual bottle in a bottle warmer...this is the PERFECT product for feeding your baby with formula!!,5
Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy Strap - 4 count (GIRLS),"so great, just wish it had a few more snaps on it so we could get the perfect fit on some items.Doesn't work for bottles.",5
Fisher-Price Zen Collection Cradle Swing,Bought the cradle swing as a gift. The baby loves it. The large seat gives the baby more freedom to move. Easy to set up.,5
"KF Baby Animal Soft Sole Booties, for 3-12 Months - Elephant",Love these slippers and so does my son. The fit is great! He's 7 months old and he has some room to grow. The booties never fall off because of the ankle gathering.,5
Munchkin Lulla-Vibe Vibrating Mattress Pad,This is the worst soother. Batteries do not last about 5 uses. You will go through enough batteries to pay for a really nice one. We used re-chargables because we went through too many batteries and it still would not run very long at all. Look to other types. Poor quality.,1
Potty Time Potty Watch - Blue,"I have twin boys and decided to buy each of them these watches to help with their potty training. When I received the watches one of them would not turn on right out to the packaging. I returned it to Amazon and ordered a replacement. The new watch worked great along with the second watch I originally ordered. My boys loved the watches, and they got excited each time the alarm went off and would race to use the potty. If the watches would have lasted longer than three weeks I would have given them a five star rating. However, within three weeks the batteries had died and the wrist bands had broken. I am currently in the market for a higher quality vibrating watch as one of my sons has a physical condition that necessitates a long term solution. If you need some help for a short period of time to start potty training, I highly recommend this watch, but know it will not last long term.",3
Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Jumperoo,My 4 month old son absolutely loves this bouncer.  It is very colorful and he loves that it lights up.  He is not playing with everything yet but he will sit in it for about 30 minutes at a time just looking at the lights and trying to reach the toys.  I would definetly recommend this bouncer!!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","The stars project on the ceiling much larger than I expected. It would also be wonderful if it played some type of soothing music, waves, etc.",3
"Storksak  Sofia SK1803 Shoulder Bag,Black Pearl,One Size","Ultra light with tons of room for baby essentials. And lot's of extra space for small items (cell phone, keys, day planner etc.). Very sexy design - definitely a more sophisticated diaper bag look! I love it :)",4
Vulli Chan Pie Gnon Natural Rubber Teether - Blue Chan,"One of the favorite teethers of my baby boy, he eagerly nibbles into Pie's ears and cheeks. Also it is a squeaky toy like a rattle Anytime I remind my baby about this toy he is smiling and getting excited to chew on it! Durable, made of 100% natural resin (kauchuk) and paint is harmless as well. Well worth the price!",5
Teething Bling Bangle - Coral,"First of all, my 9 month old likes to chew on this.  I think HE likes the chewbeads bracelets better, but I like this better!  I wish it was more of a coral color and a tad smaller around.  Maybe I have small wrists, but this is huge.  The finish is much more attractive than Chewbeads and it doesn't grab hair and clothes (Chewbeads grabs and catches on everything!).  Would have given 5stars if it fit better and color was better. But, I'll still buy this brand again!",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Love this. We keep several layers on the crib mattress: mattress pad/protector, sheet, then ultimate crib sheet. In case of nighttime accidents or illness of any sort, I can just pull the ultimate crib sheet off, have another sheet ready to go, and mattress is always protected. Deducted one star b/c both of our ultimate crib sheets balled up immediately with first wash. Not as bad with second sheet since actually followed washing directions, but still had some pilling of soft layers.",4
Eddie Bauer Wood High Chair,"I give it one star for fitting the description of a highchair and one for being aesthetically appealing.  Other than that, all that I can say is it's the type of thing you buy for your first child but definitely not your second.I just had to have this chair because it was beautiful and matched my kitchen.  Live and learn.The tray didn't come close enough to my son's chest so he could climb out even when he was strapped in.  We literally had to tie him in there to get him to stay put.And cleaning was an absolute nightmare.  It should have come with about 3 spare seat covers because it seemed like the one we had was always in the wash.  Eventually I ditched the seat cover but then there was the problem of cleaning the wood- especially with all those crevices.  At times I had to  scrape food off with a butter knife and after a while the wood became water damaged because it wasn't sealed very well.  This chair was heavy and difficult to move as  well.It converts into a youth seat if you remove a few screws, but when we tried it out, it was way too high and my son could barely fit his legs under our kitchen table which is standard height.After about a year, I sold it in the classifieds to some poor first-time parent and bought a fashionable plastic high chair at about half the cost.My SIL has this same chair and she hates hers, too.First time parents take note:  this pretty chair isn't worth the hassle.",2
HABA Kringelring Rattle Clutching Toy,I've become a big fan of Haba toys lately.  With all the stuff made in China its nice to see some quality made toys!  This is an adorable little teether that has some added little rings that make it a cute jingly noise...but nothing overly loud & annoying.  Easy to clean and maintain - durable and a kids favorite...you can't go wrong!,5
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey",This lunch box is super cute and great but only for older kids. I got it to match the backpack and I have 18months old girls at the time of purchase. It doesnt hold enough and its not well insulated. great for dry stuff :),3
"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry",We bought this crib sight unseen on amazon based on consumer report recommendation. The crib shipped free to Alaska and arrived in perfect condition. My husband put it together in no time without any problems. The crib is sturdy and looks great. We're 100% pleased with crib and amazon.com!!Others have mentioned the unsightly holes where the screws are - maybe they didn't include plugs because of potential choking hazard?,5
SheetWorld Fitted Pack N Play (Graco) Sheet - Flannel - Sage - Made In USA,All cotton flannel sheet was soooo soft AND it fit the Pack 'n Play mattress perfectly! I would definitely order from them again.,5
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Swaddle Blanket, Dino-Roar",My children love these blankets.  They are great for cool summer/fall nights and great gifts too!,5
"Sesame Street Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 40-Count","I do not like this product.  I had similar product by a different manufacture and was running out so I bought this.  Bad bad bad.  First, it's so hard to remove the plastic that is attached to adhesive, second, it won't stick to toilet seat( because adhesive is not good and because adhesive part comes off when removing the plastic).  And because of the lack of and the poor quality of the adhesive, This toiler seat does no good because it just falls into the toilet before you even use it.  Because you can't flush it down the toilet, you would have to pick up the seat that has fallen into the toilet BEFORE it's even used, so not only it works but also you would be picking this up from the toilet bowl.  No use.  I do not recommend this product.  I would give zero star if I could.",1
Night &amp; Day Bottle Warmer,I thought that I just had to have this bottle warmer. Boy was I wrong. I found this warmer to be more of a hasssle than anything. I used Avent bottle (which I love - no gas!!) so maybe the bottles are the problem - who knows. The bottles were either too hot or too cold. It is just as easy to install an instant hot water thingy on your faucet and make a warm bottle in seconds.,1
"Trend Lab Nursing Cover, Monaco",only used it when my wife was breast feeding which was for a couple months. haven't used it ever since.,3
36 x 20 Bedrail,"I purchased this bedrail last week and everything looked good until last night. My daughter sat up in bad and then fell backwards onto the edge of her pillow. She cracked her head on the SQUARE corner of this bedrail. Why would you put a SQUARE, METAL tube near a toddler's head. I quickly returned this product for the Safety First bedrail that folds down.",1
"American Baby Company Organic Cotton Quilted Multi-Use Pad , Natural","I actually bought this while pregnant and had it on our couch in the event my water broke at home! I now use it on the changing table to extend the time between having to wash the decorative changing pad covers. It's soft and waterproof, and has held up through many loads of laundry. It would also work great as a portable diaper changing pad. You could throw it in the diaper bag or keep it in the back of the car. It's much nicer than the reusable pads the big box baby retailer sells.",4
Bright Starts Baby's Play Place Play Mat,We did some research before buying this and weren't disappointed with this product.  It is multi-purpose and our 3 month son really enjoys his playtime in it.  We like that it can be configured differently depending on your needs and also that it is light and can be moved around.  Our son loves the design and the pictures that are at his eye level as well as the animated bug that he can look at (though we don't keep it on at all times).,5
"Dappi Waterproof 100% Nylon Diaper Pants, 2 Pack, White, Small","I wanted to try a cloth alternative to pull ups, but didn't want to spend $30 per diaper.  I paired these with a cloth training pant and hoped that the feeling of wetness would help my DD (age 5) get up instead of peeing in bed.  No luck, she still doesn't wake up and just soaks right through. We're back to disposable pull ups.",4
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog",I ordered this for my nephew for Christmas and I love it. It's a lot smaller than a regular backpack so I don't think you would want it for school aged kids. But it's perfect for daycare and sleepovers.,4
Ultra Soft Cuddly Plush Toy Baby Tiger Stuffed Animal 7&quot; Sitting Height,"I bought this when my son was born.  He loves it. It's very soft, and squeezable.  I've washed it many times and it holds up nice.  I bought a second one from the same seller and both times I got the tiger real fast with a friendly hand-written thank you.",5
North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,"Keeps the Grand baby in whatever room she's in. Easy to adjust and move, as long as you are an adult.",5
Jolly Jumper Sneak a Peek Sneak-a-Peek Infant Carseat Cover Deluxe - Black,I wanted this in red but got black. The color black collects too much lint. But I do like the product.,3
"Safety 1st Inflatable Spout Guard, Refresh","We had one of these (with a frog pattern) before and really liked it.  Unfortunately, our boys somehow ""popped"" that one.  The boys love the fish on this one; I like that it's not as gaudy as some of the faucet covers out there.  It really works well at cushioning the bathtub faucet and it's inexpensive.",4
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),We bought one for my 6 month old and he loves it as much as we do.  We take it when we go out to eat and it keeps him busy for ages.  We can put all kinds of foods in it and he just loves to suck  and chew on it.  It allows us to give him foods he would otherwise have to wait months to try.  Plus we do not have to worry about him choking.  Cleaning the mesh is a pain but the product is well worth the effort,5
MobiCam DXR Touch Baby Monitor,"I purchased this camera because I have a 4 year old and I'm expecting a second child, therefore the idea of having 2 cameras and only one monitor sounded very appealing. However, my issue with this product was the volume. It was very low to a point where I was worried I wasn't going to hear my daughter call, which actually happened. The image was good, sufficient to have a good idea of what was happening and it was very easy to set up. But for me, the volume, was the reason for the 2 stars, I don't like the idea of not having a higher volume set up. I was able to ship the camera back through Amazon without a problem and received the refund in a timely manner. Before returning the product I sent 2 e-mails to the manufacturer asking about the set up of the volume but didn't obtained a response. I ended up buying a simple audio monitor model of a different company.",2
"Thirsties Duo Fab Fitted Snap Cloth Diapers, White, Size Two (18-40 lbs)","I was very anxious to try this fitted, since I love the Thirsties covers.  Typically, I use a Kissaluvs fitted in the covers or even a prefold.  I must say that this Thirsties Fitted is not super absorbant. I LOVE the minky feel of this diap, but it only holds 1-2 pees.  Luckily, Thirsties covers are leak proof, but I don't like the wetness/moisture on baby. I prefer snaps to aplix because I find them to be more durable and easier to launder.  This diaper is super easy to launder.  My baby weighs 11# and it seems like he is going to outgrow the medium size setting any minute, so I would be very surprised if this diaper truly lasts to 18 lbs. I think the price of this fitted is too high, so I probably wouldn't purchase more.  That being said, I am satisfied enough with this purchase.",3
"Sunshine Kids Clip On Stroller Fan, White",I like this product but the batteries die out quite quickly.  When the batteries are new it really cools but once the batteries get a little weak it barely blows any air. So as long as you don't mind carrying around extra batteries it's quite good.,4
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet,Wow! What will they come up with next.  My oldest daughter was about to have her second baby and found this bassinet.  I had never heard of anything so convenient for baby and mother/father.  This bassinet makes the baby feel as if she/he is in the bed with the parents.  An arm's reach is exactly what this bassinet is.  I only wish this product would have been available for my babies.  It is also light weight and easy to move if needed to travel.,5
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","At first my husband thought this was the best baby item we had bought to date. After a few weeks though, the top of the brush flattened out from using it to wash the bottle of the bottles. Now it hardly cleans the bottom effectively and we had to get another brush.",3
"Bumkins Waterproof Starterbib, Blue Fizz","This fits our 10 month old perfectly.  I love that we just rinse it off to clean it after meals, then hang it back up to dry.  The pocket is also really great for catching food.  Our son likes to check the pocket at the end of his meals for crumbs!",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Trainer Kit, 9 Ounce",I really like the Avent trainer. My son and daughter both like to hold the bottle and the trainer handles make it easy for them to push the bottle up so they could finish the last drop.,5
"Summer Infant 2 Pack Cotton Knit Swaddleme, Safari (Small/Medium)","Love, love, love these!  My daughter (a.k.a Houdini) will wake herself up if not contained at night.  These wraps are soft, snuggly, and durable.  She wears them nightly and gives Mama an entire night&#8217;s sleep.",5
"The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Newborn Pacifier, Blue/Green","After I had my daughter 3 years ago I was like any other parent on the hunt for a pacifier she would take. She hated nuk, spit out the playtex and was iffy about mam. Eventually she took avent which cost me a ton of money when they went missing. I wish these had been around 3 years ago! With a new baby on the way we are choosing these to take place of the more expensive ones. I am reading a lot of griping about how these aren't the same as what the hospital gives bit there is a solution to that. Byop( bring your own pacifiers) if baby never gets the hospital binky, baby will never know another exsists. I did this with my first and will be doing it again with this one. Its perfectly acceptable to bring your own for baby to get used to and its encouraged. So pack those binkys in your flight bag( what we call the hospital bag because most people take off running when hearing the word labor) and end the griping about how these "" aren't the same"".",4
Orbit Baby Stroller Travel System G2 with Stroller Seat G2 Ruby Slate,"Buying a stroller has become a bit like buying a car. Once you make your choice, you spent so much money, it is difficult to stay objective about a review. Of course I want to say this is the best, and I believe that it is, but there are things that could have been different. They are really minor though like the red of the car seat and the hood are not the same red, but it still matches very well. The entire stroller as a whole seems to wooble a bit to the left and right, but so do all of the high end strollers that i compared this one too like Stoke etc. I am sure this will be a good stroller to own. It is a bit on the heavy side, but the travel system was just too good of a feature to pass on. It does disconnect and connect very easily, and folder is a snap. The tires are a foam/rubber solid design which was important to me. There was a recall on the base's handle, but we received the repair kit and nothing seemed unsafe to me (the recall had to do with the small knob being able to be pulled off). In fact we didn't even need to make the repair, so clearly ours was not effected by the recall, but it is nice to know the company is looking out for our baby's safety.Bottom line...if you like the features that is bringing you to consider this stroller then get it and don't look back. Those features work very well i.e. connecting/disconnecting, rotating seat, travel system, and easy to fold.",5
Wide Neck Baby Bottle 10 Oz. 1 Bottle,"I'm so upset that I bought this bottle.  First, the nipple collapsed when used so, I have to buy another set of nipples which cost $5 (NUK by Gerber was the recommendation by the company that made this bottles) Secondly, of coarse since the the NUK nipples are NOT made for this bottle it doesn't fit properly.  It leaks once you shake the formula not just wasteful but time consuming when you have to wipe up the milk that spills all over the bottle.  Lastly, the most allarming was it can creat a small gap between the nipple and the lid which can spill the milk all over child.  You are better off buying different brand.  I won't say any brand but just NOT this one!!!",1
Today's Mom Cozy Cuddler Pregnancy Pillow - White,this pillow helps the pressure off my back 6 mts. pg and needed this pillow last mth lol  cant wait be use it to breast feed my baby boy,5
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,This pad fit the area of a large changing dresser type table well & changing pad covers fit nicely as well. Very good pad for the price.,5
,"If you have a picky eater, or even if your little one eats well, you need the Funbites food cutter!Here's how it works. You start out with your food, whether it be a sandwich, fruit, veggies, or anything else you can think of. You take your Funbites and separate the two pieces. Set the cutter on your food and gently rock it back and forth to cut your food. Insert the extra piece and your little squares of food pop out! It works so great, it doesn't squish your food, and leaves a clean cut.",5
"BabySmart Cooshee Booster Seat Classic, Navy",This booster is everything I was looking for.  We had purchased plastic boosters with all the straps and buckles in the past and they slid on the wooden chairs and were really more of a hassle than they were worth.  I bought two of these Cooshees and my kids are comfortable and sit happily in them.  What more can you ask for?,5
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"I didn't really buy this as a travel potty, although I did buy some of the bag refills so I can take this to the park for emergencies.  I bought this to use on public restroom toilets.  Does fit in my small diaper bag, but is a tight fit with diapers inside (have a younger child still in diapers).  Would fit easily if I didn't have to carry diapers for the other little one.  Better to carry in medium or large diaper bag.  Does come in it's own plastic carry bag if you don't want to put in a diaper bag.  So far it has fit fine on all public toilets we've used.  I love the fact that my toddler can now hold onto the 'feet' of this potty chair instead of the sides of the public toilet.  Being that it is made for travel and to be compact it is small in the fact that if you have a little boy, you need to teach him to keep his legs together when sitting on this on a public toilet (if he's not peeing standing up yet).  Overall, I like having this for sanitary purposes and for park emergencies.",5
"Philips Avent BPA Free Classic Bottle to First Cup Trainer, 4+ Months, Clear","This is a pricier sippy cup than others, but definitely worth it!  My son has been using this since 4 months old and is doing great.  Love watching him drink water on a regular basis.",5
Skip Hop Moby Waterfall Bath Rinser,My 2 year old loves bath time but hates to get water in her eyes. This product works great to keep the water from going in her face and ruining bath time. The whale is a hard plastic but the yellow rim is soft and molds nicely to her head. Would recommend this product.,5
Philips AVENT 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I thought that I would love this sterilizer, the concept is great. However, after a few uses the bottom has burned and is burning the plastic. Pretty expensive item and might not be usable soon. I have made sure to use the correct amount of water and made sure the sterilizer is level. I don't recommend this product.",2
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,It's a great teether and is cuddly and holds my son's attention. We take it everywhere. It also has a squeeker which helps focus his attention if he starts fussing.,5
"Baby Reusable Boy Pocket Cloth Diapers, 6 pcs + 6 Inserts","my daughter soon outgrew charlie banana small size.. i paid like $90 for those. i liked those except the fact that there was occasional leakage. specially after my daughter's  tummy time. The inserts on those CB diapers were heavy and so made her bottom heavy.SOoooo glad i bought these... absolutely worth it without a heavy price tag... + comes in so many color and cute options. the one size are very versatile and can be adjusted with just a snap of few buttons. havent seen any leak yet even after tummy time,, the inside cloth is super smooth and doesnot leave button marks on my baby's soft skin.if you are a cloth diapering mom like me... these are your go to diapers. !!!!i read that they were slow to arrive.... i contacted the seller who quickly responded to my emails... and i got the product in 7days.. instead of the usual 17. really happy with the prompt customer service.",5
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","I say the last swaddler and not the only swaddler.  I bought this one when my baby was only a few weeks old and he totally hated it.  Don't get me wrong... he hated almost all swaddling (or at least being swaddled) and I only stuck with it because it was the THE ONLY WAY he would sleep.  Other swaddle blankets/products he would tolerate though. This one just made his scream bloody murder if he even got close to it.  No idea why! I almost gave it away but read other reviews saying that it worked well for older babies (2-3 months).  So, I busted it out again after he started busting out of everything else and ... voila!  He now at least tolerates it/sometimes likes it (swaddling does get easier folks!) and it is now the only thing I use.  He will need to be weaned from it in a few weeks but even $30 is a small price to pay for a month or two of good sleep.  I'd buy another as a backup if he were not so close to being done with swaddling altogether.By the way, not that it really matters but this particular Green with Beige Trim color is pretty ugly!  It looks like hospital issue scrubs which you don't really want when it already feels like you are putting your baby in a straight jacket.  Buy a better looking one while you are at it.",5
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"We were desperate for anything to help our baby sleep! This is a time in your life where you would almost do anything for sleep! We had a hard time getting her down at night. A friend told me about this and I went out the next day and bought it! We tried it for a week and just let her get used to it! Then we started turning it on and leaving her in the crib awake. The first night it took almost 3hrs to get her down. We would go in every 7 minutes and turn it back on. The second night it only took us 30 minutes to get her to sleep. Now we are down to 15 minutes and sometimes less than that! She does not cry at all!We all love the different sounds, especially the one that sounds like ocean waves and windchimes! Also love the fact that there are different volume settings and you can have just music or just projection. Our baby also loves the projection on the ceiling!Be prepared to purchase lots of D batteries! They go out pretty fast for us! The only things I would really hope that Fisher Price changes is adding a remote feature so you are not walking in every 7 minutes to turn it on (it would be so nice just to press a remote button instead of going in the room to touch the button)and also lengthening the time it plays, considering that it takes a normal baby at least 20 minutes to fall asleep!The motor is a litle noisy, but it just reminds me of the way an IV pump sounds in the hospital.We have a convertible crib where the area it hangs is larger than most cribs and it fits just fine!!!",5
"Cardinal Gates Corner Cushion, Brown",They are great.  When my grandson comes over I don't worry about him falling and hurting himself on the table corners.,5
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra",I love Britax seats. Both of my cars eats are Britax. We have two Advocates and two Boulevard seats. I drive a Pilot and started searching for a new seat for our four year old while pregnant with our third child. I wanted to find a seat that would fit between the Advocate and the baby seat...three across the back. The key was seat width. I also have a tall child so I wanted to find something that he would fit into. Many reviews of other seats said they had a short stride. After looking at every five point harness booster this one seemed like it would work. It does! I can fit all three kids across the back. It was easy to install and my son can buckle himself in with ease. Love the seat. W are going to get a second one for the other car.,5
"Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey","My wife and I are the proud owners of 4 of these puppies.  Now we don't have to worry about our kids falling in the toilet butt first and getting flushed down the toilet.  It is every overprotective parent's worst fear, next to kids falling off bikes without helmets or being unreachable by cell phone.  BUT I DIGRESS!So, I was doing my usual Amazon comparison shopping on my iPhone while shopping at major brick-and-mortar retailers when I stumbled upon this great find.  It was on the shelf at this particular retailer, and the Amazon review told me that I had found a winner.  Elated (as elated as you can be about a toilet seat for training a toddler), I bought 4 of them.  Yes, that's one for each toilet in the house.  I was most concerned about the new oval/elongated toilet in our downstairs bathroom.  Our old round toilet broke, and the plumber recommended an elongated toilet for reasons I cannot repeat in an Amazon review.  BUT I DIGRESS AGAIN.  Anyway, I wasn't sure this seat would work well for all of our toilets.  As you might guess from my 5-star review, it works PERFECTLY!  Like a poopy in the toilet, not in the underpants, this is cause for celebration.  Seriously, though, this seat is a real winner on multiple fronts:+ Simple, Dummy-Proof: Just put it on the toilet!+ Soft/Comfortable: They should make real toilet seats out of this stuff.  Very nice!  If only my butt were small enough!+ Easy to Clean: Just wipe away.  No small crevices or other tough-to-clean areas.+ Universal Fit: Fits our round AND oval/elongated toilets.+ Space Efficient: Stands on end beside the toilet when not in use.  Very cool.+ Integrated Splash Guard: Works great for our little guy's little guy, if you know what I mean.+ Excellent Value: For the money, I feel this product is an excellent value.+ Fashionable: Berry Blue is quite the statement.  Why sit on a white seat when you can have Berry Blue?",5
Blooming Bath Baby Bath - Hot Pink,Bought this for a baby gift and it is sooooo cute.  The Mother of the baby loves it.  She says it makes bathing the baby soooo much easier.  I got the pink (of course for a baby girl) but the other colors are adorable also.  It is so soft it has to be comfortable.  I would purchase another one for a gift.,5
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman",I like this pack n play and will keep it as this is our last baby ..: but I don't likeHow the bassinet attaches its kinda loose which makes me nervous. But with the weight if the baby it will stay in place just perfectly!,4
"Munchkin Deluxe Potty Seat, Colors May Vary","Even though others have said it, I have to chime in so no one else ends up buying this seat! I have a boy and the pee gets under the front AND back pieces that are attached to the bottom every single time. They can't be removed and the pee drips and even pours out of them when the seat is removed. I have to stand there for a long time trying to stick the edge of pieces of toilet paper under them to absorb the pee and while I'm doing the front piece, pee is pouring out from the back piece all over the hard-to-clean handles and the toilet. I just now threw it in the trash. My son is upset that I threw out his potty seat and I feel bad because I have been scolding him for not aiming well enough. Now that I have read the reviews from everyone else, I had to apologize to him and tell him that all the other boys have the same problem!",1
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I like this product. I am a stay at home parent to a son who just turned 2 and another who's 9 months old, with another baby due in 2 months. So, I've got my hands full, and they're only getting fuller. Before this product, I had to hold each individual toy and let the water drain out of them, and then put them away. Now, I can place all of the toys in here to drain out into the tub. It's one easy step, and it saves me several minutes, which is very important since I have little time and LOTS of tasks to do throughout the day. This has to be removed before someone can close the shower curtain and use the shower (and I'm pretty sure I'd forget it's there and trip over it if I TRIED to take a shower with it in there. So, we take it out and put it on the counter, take our showers, and put it back. It keeps our floor dry and keeps our bathroom looking neat. Oh, and it does help that my 2 year old is willing to help put his toys away in this because it's so easy for him to reach. I don't know if I ever got a divider... Maybe I accidentally threw it out. I only ever plan on using this for toys, anyway, though.",4
Em's 4 Bubs Hearing Protection Baby Earmuffs Size 0-18 Months (Black),"The ear muffs only work if the baby's head does not rest on anything.  While holding or nursing my three-month old son, the ear muffs would move around and scrunch up his ears.  Perhaps they would work better on a six month plus child?  But they did look very cute.  Would not buy again.",2
"Summer Infant ChangeAway, Black",I love it! Fits in my diaper bag perfectly. The only issue I had is that it was difficult sticking diapers inside the mesh side pockets. I had to stick them in there one by one. Other than that it's great!!!,4
Boba Classic Baby Carrier 2G - Dusk,"I love this carrier.  The fabric is thick & very soft.  I use it primarily to carry my toddler on my back & it's amazing how light she feels in comparison to others.  It's such a great fit & easily adjustable.  The shoulder straps are thick & padded, I don't feel the strain.  The waist band is thick so there's no digging, again comfortable.  It is a very natural position for babies to be in & my baby has fallen asleep many times in it.  It is nice to have the little ""canopy"" that unrolls so that her head won't wobble around if she's asleep.  It's very easy for me to put her on & take down from my back by myself.  (Go to the manufacturer's website & see the instructional video.)  FYI: I think on the website it said somewhere made in USA, but when I received it, the tag says Made in China.  I haven't had to wash this yet but will update review when I do.",5
Fisher-Price Sing with Me Step Stool,"I actually got this because I thought it was a great idea and was worried that it would be discontinued by the time my son got old enough to need it. Once it arrived I naturally had to make sure it worked and now I can't bring myself to take it away from him. He pushes the button to turn on the music and then dances until it stops (at which time he rushes to push the button again). So far I don't find the music at all annoying, but there is a switch on the bottom to set the volume to High, Low, or Off. This stool is also the perfect height so as to enable him to look out the windows of our house. He can now stand on the stool and wave when he sees Daddy coming home from work. Hopefully he doesn't wear it out before he gets old enough to do his own washing and brushing.",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,used this only 5 days so give a indepth review but so far it's been working great. The sound is loud and clear and the video is better than what we expected. the night vision is by far the best i've seen so far and we do not have a problem viewing our baby at night with the camera position around 8 feet away from the crib mounted on a shelf,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this for a 5 year old family friend and she loves it! I kind of really want one for myself...,5
"Fisher-Price Bath Tub, Rainforest Friends","The infant insert could be a little more durable.  I was pulling my little one out of it and heard a little tear.  Little alarming, not wanting it to snap with them in it, but I think it's ok.  Otherwise, I am pleased.  Once my twins grow bigger and don't need the insert, that won't be a concern anymore.",3
Parents My Mp3 Classical Music MP3 Player,"Easy to use, selection of classical songs, a cute toy, nice for bedtime or any time.  Would recommend for boys or girls.",4
"Waterproof Feeder Bib w/Flip Pocket, 3 Pack, Boy, Frenchie Mini Couture","Initially I liked these quite a bit, but now the lining is falling to pieces after washing it for less than 3 months. Will not buy again. Had to buy more(but another brand).",2
Maxboost Fusion Snap-on iPhone 5S/5 Case - Pink (Fit Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5S/5),I requested this case in anticipation of getting a new phone.  I love it!  It's very durable yet lightweight.  I cannot wait to get my new phone so that I can use it.I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation!!,5
"Cosco Juvenile Funsport Play Yard, Kontiki",This is exactly what we needed for our little Granddaughter to sleep in when she comes over for the night!,5
One Direction Life-size Stand-up Cutout- Niall,Gifted this to a teenager who is a huge 1-D fan for her birthday. The package arrived in time and in good shape.,5
"Disney 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set, Taking The Race",The product arrived in good condition and as I paid for fast delivery I received it the next day.  Sheets are nice and soft.  I was a bit disappointed in the comforter as I was expecting a heavier. fuller stuffed comforter.  Will have to use a second blanket in the winter with this quilt.,4
Sippy Cup,"This was one of the best baby purchases we made. The cup never leaked, is easy (but not too easy) to open, and we still take it to outings, with the kid being almost 4 years now.",5
SwaddleDesigns Baby Lovie - Polka Dot Flannel with Bright Blue Satin,"Half of our house is tiled and my two year old likes to carry his regular blankie around with him when he is tired. Problem with that is he trips and slips on it and falls on the tile. SO I got this thinking maybe if he could have a blanket that wasn't dragging around his feet on the tile it would be safer. And I had been looking everywhere for a smaller one that didn't have a stuffed animal attached to it. It has worked wonderfully. No big blanket off the carpet, but the little one he can carry anywhere. I LOVE the bright blue color too.",5
"Contours Lite Stroller, Tangerine","I really like this stroller, it steers easy.  The seat leans back and positions up great for my little guy (8 months).  I gave it four stars, my only complaint is that is does not fold very compact like some of the other lighter strollers.",4
"Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat, Mystique",the shoulder straps aren't easy to adjust but at least i know he's safe in the car seat just cant wait to see how that works when he's bigger,3
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Sweater Knit Blanket, Celery/Gray ZigZag","The measurement is 30 x 30, which doesn't seem that big. But it is great to put on top of a baby or toddler in a car seat when it is cold. I use it on my son, who is two, in the mornings when it is a little chilly in the morning. I just tuck him into in the carseat and he sleeps on the way to daycare with the blanket keeping him warm.The colors are great for either a boy or a girl. I will be having a little girl in a couple of months so I plan on using this with her as well in the bassinet or just cuddling when cold.It feels just like a sweater, it isn't too thick or too thin in my opinion and it can be tossed in the washer as well.",4
"Stokke Tripp Trapp Cushion, Beige Stripe",The concept is awesome. Jazz up your chair with color and print. Quality is pretty poor! Picture directions do not mention the removal of the plastic clip to put straps on. Good idea just not worth the 40 plus bucks!,3
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary","We are very pleased, it fits well and is very secure for our newly potty trained daughter.  It came in the color white with a lime ring.  It is cute and well made.",5
Nuby 2-Pack 8 oz No Spill Cup with Super Spout (Color may vary),"I bought this for my 4 month old daughter who drank some water from a cup when I offered it to her. She and I both love this cup. It does not leak. She likes to grab the handles. It's easy to drink from, though mostly she just bites on it since she is teething now. Overall great cup!",5
"OXO Tot On-The-Go Drying Rack and Bottle Brush, Green","OXO lives up to its reputation of producing well-designed, high-quality, cushion-gripped innovative products.The brush is full sized and the innovative split design has click locks to provide a secure wand. The case can accomodate between 6-8 bottles or sippy-cups plus about the same number of nipples.The ridged, elevated bottom ensures that water wicks away and provides air-circulation for quicker drying. A holder is designed into the case so that the wet brush can stand vertical and dry along with the bottles.For travel, everyting secures well into the case and the ventilation on the sides ensure that the brush keeps on drying to inhibit bacteria growth.Pros:1. Sturdy, high-quality product can stand abuse2. Practical design3. Silicone cleaner to get into those nooks and crannies4. No sharp edges5. OXO colors that coordinate with other OXO baby productsCons:1. Little bulkier than expected - ~2.5x a travel wipes container.2. No drainage holes - so the water sits on the bottom. Do not let sit for prolonged periods due to bacteria concerns. Having drainage holes for a travel product is impractical",4
Safety 1st: Rockin' Jitter Buggy,"My son really enjoys his jitter buggy, it has cute indicator lights and sounds, he loves the vibration, he's 6 months and has sat happily in it up to an hour while I was cleaning. Once he gets bored with one side, I turn the seat so he's facing the other direction. I got it on sale at a great price so definitely worth the price.It is a bit bulky, luckily our apartment has an open layout so it tucks away against a wall, but it is not portable and you can't really store it. I do move it room to room without any problem, even when he is in it, I just push it into the kitchen or family room and nothing falls apart (as another reviewer wrote)",4
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",I understand most of the rave reviews. There isn't much to complain about - Except! The seat simply does not recline well enough for a child to rest comfortably without their head falling forward. It's a nightmare compared out our old comfy cozy Britax. I don't recommend this at all. Buy a Britax.,2
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","I can't stand the clutter of having a bottle brush laying around my sink-area. I love that this brush has a perfect little stand that you can drain the excess water from. It stays neat, clean and most importantly: dry. The bristles are strong and everything works perfectly. For $3.99 you can't go wrong. I might buy a second one...",5
"Chicco Capri Lightweight Stroller, Tangerine",We've tried a couple of strollers.  This is the first one that's small and light enough to take everywhere but tough enough to avoid getting bashed to pieces.,5
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,5 month old baby girl loves this. the lights are soothing as well as the music. would buy for future babies.,5
Diaper Dude Messenger II Diaper Bag in Black Pinstripe,its smart and have sufficient space. it is very practical with the outside pockets for fast needed things such as handkerchief and water bottles.,5
Sesame Street Baby Bag - Elmo and Friends Diaper Bag,"beautiful bright colors and a suitable size and light weight, but the zipper must be stronger because they use many of the child. , Everything is beautiful and I liked it",4
UPPAbaby Car Seat Adapter for Chicco,The car seat adaptor is so easy to install and take off anyone can do it.  It makes the Uppa Baby stroller very versatile because you can use it from day one.  I love that the adaptor folds up with the stroller.,5
"OXO Tot Straw and Sippy Cup Top Cleaning Set, Orange",Can finally get in those little nooks & crannies in my Granddaughter's sippy cup top. Really does the job right.,5
"Re-Play Bowls, Purple, 2-Count",These are NOT orange. They are yellow. Very disappointed 2 year old who's favorite color is orange.  They are solid bowls and perfect size for a toddler.,2
Chicco Lullaby LX Playard Romantic,"I registered for and received this play yard, and when my baby was about a month old I went out and bought the graco one.  This one has done nothing for the past few months in my house except collect dust.  Here's a list of pros and cons:Pros:- The black & grey is a sleek, modern look - considering this is going to be a piece of furniture in your living space, it's nice that it's simple, clean look.  However, the skirt/dustruffle along the bottom does not present as neatly as it does in the product photo (see cons below).- You can wheel it around while it's fully packed up (with the Graco one, the wheels pack into the cover so you can't roll it once you're all zipped up).- The vibrating unit has a neat light that captures the baby's attention, may be soothing to some.- The arches with the animals hanging off is a good idea and the whole mat can be removed and put onto the floor if you prefer to play with it there.Cons:- HEAVY, bulky.- VERY stubborn to fold up.  I wrestled with this thing for a good half hour the first time I put it away, despite having followed the directions closely.- When the mat is installed to the high position for newborns, there are hook & eye loops that secure it to the sides.  They are SO difficult to fasten, my father-in-law and I had to take turns trying!- When the arches with the animals are up, it's very difficult to put a sheet on the mat - the arches fasten under 4 corners of the mat and it directly interferes with a fitted sheet.- The loops that hold the animals on are very poorly designed - like a cheap afterthought.  The animals slip off very easily.- When the arches are up it's very awkward to try to take the baby in and out.- The changing station is not comfortable.  It's just this plasticky material that isn't suited to any sort of fabric sheet or cover that you can buy to put over it.  I never used the changing station.- The dust ruffle along the bottom is all wrinkled when you take it out of the box and I could not figure out how to flatten it out.  I wonder how you'd take an iron to that!  I had the thing open in my living room for 5 months and the wrinkles never smoothed out.",3
"Organic Wool Dryer Balls, Natural, Set of 3",My dog loves to follow me to the laundry room in hopes of scoring one of my prized woolen balls.  We'll probably have to get a set just for him.  These are less expensive than some of the others I have seen and they work really well.  I will be a return customer.  Shipped promptly.,5
Baby Crawling Knee Pad Toddler Elbow Pads Stripe Blue,"These knee pads for our 1 year old are not only very cute, they are very functional.  They work.  Highly recommended.",5
Jacana 6 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set by Cocalo,"The crib set is very cute and I do like it however when I took the quilt( main piece ) out of the packaging there was a black stain next to the elephant's head. I am extremely disappointed about this. I knew the bedding wouldn't stay perfectly clean forever, but I did expect for it to atleast start out that way. Considering how much I spent, I find this completely unacceptable.",1
"Honeysuckle Breast Milk Storage Bags, 75 Ct (3 Boxes of 25 pcs)","With my first child, I tried at least six different types of bags, but I never heard of Honeysuckle.  I pump a lot (16-24oz. per session), so I go through bags quickly.  Lansinoh was the best in terms of price and features.  I noticed that I would get a few busted or leaky bags, especially at the bottom and that really bothered me.With my second child, I started using Lansinoh again, but then I happened upon these Honeysuckle and I love them soooo much more.  They are reinforced at the bottom, thicker, and I especially love the thick border on the sides.  Oh, and it's OXO biodegradable, so that's a plus.  I also like that I don't have to write upside down for storing!  I highly recommend these.",5
"Halo Early Walker SleepSack Wearable Blanket Micro-Fleece, Baby Blue / Cream, X-Large, 2-Pack",Perfect for the baby/toddler who won't keep blankets on.  Leg holes make it easy to walk around.  Super comfy too.,5
"Mini Orchestra, Set of 4","I first saw these things in the music class that my daughter goes too... babies love love love anything that make sounds! They were on sale on Amazon so I purchased it. They come in a set of 4Metal Bells - that's my favorite! It's very well made and can get quite loud... you can shake them anyway you want and they make this get jinglebell sound (great for Xmas time!!)Plastic beads - I like this one a lot too... you can also shake it anyway you want and this one is less loud than the bells and not as heavy so it's good for younger babiesPlastic Clasps - This one is okay, you have to shake it up and down so it makes the sound...Plastic covered metal tambourine - you would have to shake this one side to side... This is probably my less favorite one.Overall, I think these are very well made (it should be given these are not cheap for shakers) But you want to get something sturdy and not cheap for shakers. Your baby is shake it, bang it, throw it, and drop it from the highchair so you want quality toys that would fall part!",4
"Ju-Ju-Be Memory Foam Changing Pad, Marvelous Mums","I bought this changing pad because I love the Marvelous Mums print. However, two things irked me.  First, I carefully opened the amazon box like I do every box (using a pair of scissors as a box cutter) and the pad was literally sitting right up there under the shipping tape, unprotected by any paper or packaging materials. (Just the super thin plastic sleeve that JuJuBe packages these pads in) and the very dull kitchen scissors managed to slice through the plastic bag and made a 6"" slice through the changing pad.  Geez! I have never seen anything like it (nor have I ever damaged something when opening packaging) Ridiculous packaging job. Now the pad is ruined.Of course because I just spent $20 on it & don't want it sitting in the landfill, I'm going to try to use it. Here comes issues 2 & 3, which have to do with the actual pad design: The memory foam is very thin, and easily smashes down to surface you are changing your baby on. So, if we're in a public restroom using a Koala changing station, I put the pad down, and it's not offering my infant any cush! No ""pad"" to it. It smashes flat and so it's basically just a pretty piece of nylon fabric between baby and the table. Blah. Pointless really.  Another thing, there is no closure on this pad. You cannot fold it up and snap it closed or anything. It's bulky so it's constantly opening up in my bag, preventing me from finding whatever I'm digging for.  Sigh.",3
Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,My 2 year old Thomas Loving grandson LOVED this.  It is dishwasher safe and makes meals so much more fun for him.,5
BuggyLOVE Stroller Cleaning Kit,"My poor baby threw up into the seat of his stroller and after being unable to get the stink out, I thought we would need a new one! Even after washing the seat with detergent and drying it, placing my son in the seat would make his freshly cleaned clothes smell like throw up again :-( . I researched having it professionally cleaned at a stroller spa type place, but the price of cleaning was the cost of a new umbrella stroller. I couldn't justify that. I found out about this product and was drawn to the fact that it cleans without harsh chemical. I was skeptical as to whether it would work on stinky vomit. It certainly did! I used all the products included to detail the whole stroller. It looks new AND the smell of throw up is gone. So happy I can use the stroller again. This is a must have for anyone with a stroller.",5
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"I love the spoons for the babies, they can chew on them and it soothes their gums, nice bright colors and they wash nicely.",5
alphabet nesting &amp; stacking blocks .,I was surprised by the poor quality.  My not yet a year old distroyed them in less than a few weeks.,2
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,"My son started using this at 2 months old, and took to it right away!  We discovered he liked it best when we took off the hanging toys (underneathe) and slid it over his bouncy seat like a piano (which happened to be a perfect fit). He would &quot;sing&quot; along with each hit of the keys.  When we praise him or sing along, he's so proud of the beatiful music he makes and beams from ear to ear.  The volume control is just right for babies senstive to loud noises, as is mine.I even found a way to clip/hang some of his other toys to the top so that with every swat of them, he hits the keys and makes music.Fun product and great for early cause-and-effect learning.  Also a snap to assemble!!!",5
Leachco Back 'N Belly Chic - Taupe,"I love this thing... I got it for after I had a tummy tuck and I needed extra support for sleeping. I slept inside of it with one pillow underneath to support my butt and my spine. My kids called it 'Mommy's nest', lol. It's worth the money for sure!",5
Clevamama Splash and Wrap Baby Bath Towel (Cream),"This hooded towel is more than just a baby towel.  First off, it's huge (size of adult towel) and will be useable for many years.  Second, it snaps around your neck; allowing you to be ""splash-free"" and enabling you to safetly wrap your child up after the bath and keep him/her warm and cozy.  This towel makes a great gift for anyone who is expecting!",5
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Extra Tall Walk-Thru, Bronze",This is a great looking gate - although I will admit it was a heck of a lot harder to install than the pressure mount bronze versions we have in our regular door frames. Like the ease of opening and closing and how nice it looks in our home.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Easy to wash and babies easily grabs it with their little fingers. Natural food based coloring and ruber. No smell,5
"Bumbo Booster Seat, Blue","I had to have a travel solution for my 13 month old because we are traveling for a few months and needed a highchair.  We had the original bumbo when she was a newborn (and loved it) and now this is just fantastic.  It secures to the chair perfectly (any chair I've tried) and she fits snugly in the seat.  Obviously it was meant for a taller baby, but with a few towels underneath it's perfect!",5
"[Different Colors Available] Newisland&reg; 79&quot; x 98&quot; Huge XXL Exquisite Handcraft Family Tree Wall Decor Removable Wall Decals No Self Peeling (Black, Large Left)",I was pleasantly surprised by the product. By reading some of the other reviews I was skeptical. The tree is pretty much how it was described except for it only came with four vinyl birds and more leaves. I followed one of the other reviews suggestions and used a hair dryer on the tree once I had it in place. This really stuck the vinyl into all the small crevices of my wall and removed all the last small air bubbles......I have textured walls. I have had no problems of it coming off. The picture frames are cheap looking but I replaced them with dollar store frames and it looks awesome. Overall I am quite pleased with the product.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Toddler Bed, Pink","We just moved, and our furniture will not arrive for about 6 weeks. My daughter loves this little cot. It is comfortable and sturdy. Good for ages 3-6.",5
Galt Playnest - Jungle,"So my baby was very frustrated when she was in that awkward &#34;I don't want to lay down but I don't have the physical capacity to sit up yet&#34; phase. It's the phase I hit after 4 glasses of wine. She hit it at 3 months. I brought this with us everywhere we traveled, my dad found it hilarious, called it a baby container. This nest propped her up and gave me a break, she loved sitting in it I would haul it into the bathroom and I could take a shower. A shower! Thank you Galt, my husband thanks you as well. I was getting pretty desperate. And stinky.  Once she got the knack of sitting up and crawling I stopped relying on it so heavily. But, still a nice spot for her to relax when she first wakes up, she's 9 months now and she likes to look at the animals and recline in it. It looks so cozy, I want one in my size. It's bright, colorful, very high quality fabric. This is a very well made and amazing product, those Germans, they know how to make nice things.",5
Yummi Pouch (Set of 6),"We loved these for a little while, maybe 6 months or so. One by one they started falling apart. I think we are down to just one or two now. The top closure pulled away from one side, keeping it from properly sealing.",3
"Munchkin Hello Kitty Click Lock 2 Count Insulated Sippy Cup, 9 Ounce",My baby girl loves it. All I would say is that allow users to see the back of these as they other figures than Hello Kitty.,4
Bumkins Waterproof Sleeved Bib - On-The-Go,"My 1yo son is above the 95th percentile in size.  We've been using this bib since he was about 7 months old. It just fits weird.  I have to use small binder clips to make it tight around his neck.  And it creeps up too.  So when he is trying to take food off the tray and put it in his mouth, the bib gets in the way.  It also blocks his view of the tray.  I've tried tucking it down under the edge of the tray before I attach it to the chair but it's too short.  I ended up fashioning a strap from 2 rubber bands and two binder clips to try to get it closer to his body.  Kind of a hassle.  I will be on the look out for another shirt-type bib but continue to use this in the meantime.",3
"Swaddlebees Capri Cloth Diaper Cover SNAPS (size 2, Marina)",Super cute and fit perfectly!,5
The First Years Mickey Mouse 4 Piece Feeding Set,"This little set has been a joy to use with my grandchildren. I hand wash them, and the colors have held true with no peeling. Very cute and bright.",5
Koala Baby Luxe Blanket in Blue,"This item is NOT a Little Giraffe Blanket. It is a plain blue blanket by """"Koala Baby."""" Don't be misled!",1
TotShield Stove Guard for Free Standing Gas and Electric Stove,It works great. We bought it because our dog jumpped up and turned on the gas on our stove twice. Very dangerous!  This product is exactly what we needed. Its easy to remove and replace as needed ans so far it has kept our dog and our daughter away from the stove!!,4
Fisher-Price Soothe n' Play Bouncer,"Works well on a D-Cell battery (you have to supply) and it was fairly easyto construct. It is a little big for my daughter now, but I look forwardto her growing into it.",4
"Skip Hop Dunks Stacking Bath Toy, Blue, Green, Yellow","Though my son is not old enough yet to care about these, I think they're fantastic and I'm pretty sure they'll be a hit when he does notice them. I use them to pour water over his head after washing, as the tail makes a very good and precise pour spout (tried the head first, but the eyes are holes and they dripped, of course). They are brightly colored, a great size, very cute, and a simple smooth shape that will be easy for him to grab and manipulate when he's a little older. And they float along nicely.",5
Natural Madison Toddler Bed,"When I found out I was having another baby, I knew it was time for my older (about 2ish) son to give up his crib! Hes 2 1/2 now and LOVES this bed!It was easy to put toghether, me and my husband did it in about 45 minutes (take in consideration I was a cranky, pregnant, wife!) and my son was estatic!The bed is beautiful and withstands jumping, rolling, kicking, and of course, sleeping! The rails prevent him from rolling out, and they are nice and safe! His bed looks great with Elmo sheets and he has never been happier!It took our average sized crib matress and its easy to get in and out of...We absolutley love this bed, and my son, who was attatched to his crib, loves it too!",5
Medela Contact Nipple Shield - Standard Size (24mm),"Great tool to use just be careful of lowered milk production and clogged ducts.  The nurses in the hospital gave this to me because my baby was not comfortable with the latch.  Turned out she had an attached frenulum (upper lip) and may have not latched in the beginning because of it.  This got us started and about a month in I transitioned without it because if you don't have one around it's panic time!  Also, I was getting clogged ducts because it's harder for babies to pull all of the milk out with the shield.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Personally I think this toy looks pretty fancy. Unfortunately, my baby girl did not show any interest in it in the past few months. Now she is 10 months old already, still has no interest.",1
Puj Flyte - Compact Infant Bath (White),"This is the best infant tub on the market! It molds to my sweet little babies bum, and it's so soft without losing its shape like those foam bath pads!It folds up and fits right in my duffle bag for trips to grandmas house, AND it dries in no time!! I feel safe using the puj, because unlike other tubs or foams I don't have to have my hand cradling her head all the time with her body sliping  around. She sits so snugly in it, and loves her bath time!I would recommend the Puj Tub to anyone who; ever travels, storage space is limited, hates kneeling on the dirty floor bending over the bath tub, appreciates convenience and loves their child!",5
"QuickZip Crib Sheet Set, Blue","These sheets are wonderful.  I wish I would have bought these from the start, but I thought they were too expensive.  While my son was on antibiotics for an ear infection, he was waking up every morning with diarrhea up to his chest.  So I was changing his sheets every morning.  What a pain in the butt that was.  I finally decided to buy these zip-off sheets, which makes life so much easier.  I put a regular mattress pad on his crib mattress, then placed the mattress in the sheet base and put it in the crib.  I then place a waterproof pad (Carter's brand) that just sits on top of the mattress followed by the zip-off sheet.  So whenever he pees through his diaper, I just zip off the sheet and remove it along with the waterproof pad and throw them in the wash.  The other mattress pad that stays on the mattress just adds another layer of protection and prevents the sheet and waterproof pad from slipping around.I recommend these sheets to all of my friends!",5
"Maxi Cosi Prezi Infant Car Seat, Courageous Green","I have the Prezi and I have used it with my Bugaboo Bee with great success.  I will give the seat 3.5 stars, but I rounded down.Pros:- A beautifully constructed seat that is very solid and soft.- Safety features are wonderful.- I really liked the 'stiff' shoulder straps.  I wasn't constantly having to fish them out from under her like some friends with other models.  They never dug into her cheeks because I would tighten them as much as I could once she was secured in the seat so they sat nice and flush on her chest.- It worked perfectly on the Bee with the Maxi Cosi adapters.  I loved that I could use the two in any combination I wanted (with the Bee seat in or out, facing either way, etc.)- She is still comfortable in the seat at almost 10 months (we still have one level left to raise), although it's a chore to carry the heavy car seat with her in it!Cons:- It's heavy.  I lived on the third floor with no elevator and by the time my little bean was over 10 pounds, it was quite a struggle to carry it up and down multiple times a day.- There is not a lot of room for the baby to move around and it's snug, so it can get hot because of how the material encloses the baby.  The baby does not have a lot of room to wiggle around, which is not a bad thing, but I would not recommend it in warmer climates, especially the black.- I had some trouble getting both hooks to clamp to the base consistently.  I had to occasionally 'slam' the left side of the carseat into the base to make sure it was secure.- It's a struggle for me to get the straps to loosen and tighten smoothly.Confusing/Noteworthy aspects:- This is a carseat for babies on the more petite/lean side.  You can't know how big your baby will be before they are born, but I imagine that babies with nice chunky thighs will have a hard time sitting comfortably because of the construction of the seat.  My baby is lean so it fits her perfectly, but if my next baby is a cute ball of chub, I may be in trouble.- For some reason, I didn't realize that the infant insert was removable (DUH!!) and I thought that my baby had outgrown her carseat by 2 months.  Once I removed the insert and raised the straps, she was so much more comfortable and she no longer hated being squished in the seat.- I've never had the issue of her sitting up too high and her head falling forward, but several friends have complained about that.  I don't know how, since my little one has always been pretty reclined, but I believe them.I don't regret buying the seat, and it's definitely a beauty, but I may have done things a little differently in retrospect.  It's a nice carseat, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra $$ over models like the keyfit, etc.Hope that helps!",3
"Lifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Sky/Spring Green","My son has been teething since he was 2 months old, he is 4 months old now. I got this product for him a week ago and he loves it. its easy for him to hold and can keep it in his mouth for a few minutes on his own. Its easy for my to hold it for him when I am holding him. He loves the different textures! Glad I got them!",5
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"This is the best toy we have bought.  We got it a week before our son turned 4 months, he's now 6 1/2 months and he still plays in it every day.  The toys pop out and pop in to our other evenflo products.  It was a great investment!",5
"Baby Cubes 1 Oz. Baby Food Storage Contains no Phthalates, Bisphenol-A, PVC (2 Pack) 20 Cubes","This is a PBA AND PVC free plastic which is a must and the perfect size and good quality and dishwasher safe.  My only tip is that it has a fill line your not supposed to fill past.  I know now since I didn't listen that when the food freezes it expands so if you go past the fill line the lid will pop open.  So, don't fill past the line and these containers rock!",5
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Sippy Cup, 7 Ounce, Blue/Yellow","My sister knows how picky I am, and when it was time for my twins to try sippy cups, she got me three sets of the best sippy cups she could find.  The foogo is the only one I still use.  The Oxo has a nice, simple design, but babies throw sippy cups and unfortunately, the Oxo's silicone valve falls out on impact.  The Green Sprouts cup is flimsy, and the handles are useless, but now that my kids don't need the handles anymore maybe I'll give them another try, if only to let the Foogo's dry once in a while!  The Foogo does keep everything cool and fresh, and I've only seen it leak once.  I suppose that must have been my fault.  My brats do love to stick their fingers in the spouts so that a little bit of the beverage squirts out.  Oh well, it's a crime scene whenever they eat, and it's such a small amount, anyway.  The main complaint I DO have with these cups is that the plastic base comes unglued, which isn't the end of the world, but you do have to separate the base and wash and dry it separately, so that water doesn't collect inside and either get nasty, or leak down the side of the cup next time you use it.  Four and a half stars.  I'm here to buy more!***UPDATE***  Well I bought two more, but they turned out to be a different (newer I suppose) version, with very different parts.  Honestly, I don't know how they made it out of R&D.;  The way the ""leak proof"" cover is configured, it it impossible to put together correctly, and it leaks nine times out of ten.  This is NOT ACCEPTABLE with two impatient toddlers throwing a fit in the background.  When I do use the cups, it's only for water, and I dread assembling the things and then holding my breath while I tilt them sideways and wait for the dripping to start.  Absolutely infuriating.On the bright side, they're nice-looking, and the plastic bases haven't fallen off yet.",1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red",If you are looking for a reliable carrier. Look no further. Baby Bjorn has updated the original to include some lumbar support and more comfortable straps. It still is easy to load baby and adjust. The price is the only mark off for this product. It could stand to be a little lower. We have used other carriers and not been as happy as with the Baby Bjorn. We would recommend this product to anyone.,4
"Harmony Kids Round Back Glider, Blue Chenille","We ordered this chair before my daughter was born and have had it for almost four months now.  We looked at comparable chairs that were hundreds of dollars more expensive and decided to go with this one based on the great reviews.  The chair is very comfortable and sturdy.  We decided to purchase the matching ottoman as well, and I'm glad we did.  We have spent many nights rocking our little one back to sleep in this chair.  Highly reccomend this chair for your nursery!",5
Britax Vehicle Seat Protector,"Does fit nicely, not flexible enough. Do not like to be told how many words to say on these reviews",2
Especially for Baby Wipe Warmer with bonus Diaper Organizer,"Yes, it does dry up if you just leave the warmer on. Its a big hastle to just plug and unplug to keep the baby wipes warm for your baby booty. I pretty much gave up on that and just use it to store my baby wipes and the bottom section to put diapers. Its easy to reach over to the side of my baby changing station (same height). Its very convient to use. The only bad thing about this is that the warmer stays on too long it dries up. I just warm it by holding the wipes in my hand until i think its warm enough for my baby booty. The best way, you could get a small heat where you can hold it up to it and warm it until its ready to be used. It doesnt take that long. Thats a suggestion.",3
Summer Infant Step To Secure Wood Walk-Thru Gate,"I received this gate from Summer to review.  I am a mom of a 3 year old and a 9 month old.  I love everything about this gate!  The install was very easy, no tools required.  Neither my husband nor I are very good at do it yourself projects and neither of us had any trouble figuring out how to install the gate.  Opening and closing the gate is simple, and even people who come over have no trouble figuring out how to use it.  Even if I was not sent this gate, I would buy it.  The color matches beautifully with our hardwood floors and dark cabinets and it looks much more expensive than it's price.",5
5 Pairs Mix Color Cotton Newborn Baby/infant No Scratch Mittens Gloves 0-3 Months,"Yes, I won't lie I was iffy about buying this, because mittens are hard to find(that are good).They are very very smooth/soft, I love that you get all the colors in this set.They have bands on the ends, thats a plus because mittens fall of and you have to keep a eye on them.The bands are small, so if your baby has thick arms I would say don't get these. But other then that every about these little mittens are great :)",5
Spectra Baby USA S2 Hospital Grade Double/single Breast Pump NO TOTE,"I got this pump right before adopting my daughter who has special needs. I already had milk as i am nursing my bio baby who is almost the same age as my daughter. I already had the spectra dew 350 which is a great pump and a medela Pisa. I favor the dew over the Pisa my only complaint was that it did not have a milk let down mode. The spectra s2 has everything I loved about the dew plus milk let down mode, the ability to independently adjust the cycle speed and vaccum strength. Plus a nightlight built in for night time pumping! I love this pump its super quiet way quieter than the medela and i can pump so much faster with it. I use this pump a lot multiple times a day and after two months using still love it. This pump is also made to be able to handle 120-240 volts so all you need it an adapter when traveling out of the country with it. I would reccomend this pump to anyone looking for a strong, efficient, quiet and reasonably priced pump.",5
Kids Line Boa Blanket - Lady Bug,"Ordered for a new mother, she loved it alot. She did the whole nursery in lady bugs, this was such a wonderful add to the babies room.",5
Evenflo Snugli Cross Terrain Carrier - Silver/Charcoal,"This backpack was everything everyone said it would be.  It was as comfortable as you can reasonably expect a backpack holding a 22lbs child can be and was easy to use.  We spent a couple minutes figuring out the sun shade/canopy but once understood, we had no trouble. It's great for hiking and/or taking your child someplace where a stroller is difficult to maneuver.  It has pockets and a drink holder that are very handy.  My only fear while wearing it is that if I turn my ankle or something, then the big boy and I are both going down... but otherwise it seems very safe for him and me.I do notice that after he's been in the pack more than 30 minutes he gets a bit of a red mark on the insides of his legs if his bare leg touches on that part.  It doesn't appear to chafe him or anything... more of a pressure mark.  He's has chubby legs and the inside cradle for the child seems to be kinda wide in the crotch area (probably for support reasons) but it seems a bit too wide for him.  I try to make sure and put a little towel or cloth down there if he's going to be in it for awhile.  It totally doesn't seem to bother him at all (he loves being in the pack) but it does look red when I get him out of the pack.I would suggest starting out slowly and not going on a 45 minute walk the first time out (which I did because my son seemed to enjoy it so much!) because it can be a little tiring for your back the first time.  I was not in pain or anything (was in PAIN when I used the Baby Bjorn as soon as big boy hit the 18 pound-ish mark)but the area between my shoulder blades started to feel tired.  I also notice that I tend to slump or lean forward a little when I wear it.  My husband doesn't seem to do this though... could be because he's taller and the pack doesn't hit his bottom or could be due to the fact that women's center of gravity is in the caboose while men's center of gravity is in the shoulders (also noticable when women are learning to ice skate... they tend to stick out the booty more than men!).  My friend has the same backpack and said that she stopped leaning forward after she got more used to the pack so I think it's something that you stop doing once you're used to carrying that much weight on your back.Anyway, all in all I was very pleased with the cost and functionality of the pack.  This will also come in handy when we have our second so we won't have to buy a double stroller or anything.",4
"Graco Backless TurboBooster Seat, Galaxy",This has been such a great carseat!!! It is SUPER light and easy to transfer from truck to truck. It is also really easy for my son to buckle in himself (less work for mom!). We also LOVE the 2 cup holders that hide into the seat. Most of the boosters that we have looked at only has one cup holder and it is nice to have 2 (one for a drink and the other for snacks). We definitely recommend this booster!,5
The First Years Disney Pooh Soft Potty Seat,"Bought this for my 2 year old son.  Read all the reviews and needed a seat that worked for a boy!  Previous seat I had didn't work well for potty training.  This seat on the other hand, has a large splash guard and he is very comfortable going on it.  It has made training him a breeze.",5
New Boba Wrap in Red with Matching Carrying Pouch : Infant Baby Carrier : Preemie - 18months (Previously Sleepy Wrap),This is a high quality wrap. The grey color makes it nice either my son or daughter-n-law to wear when they take our granddaughter for a walk,5
Milk It Kit - Back to Work Survival Kit for Breastfeeding Pumping Moms (includes privacy door sign),I received this kit as a gift for my shower.  My son is now 5 months and I don't know how I'd survive pumping at work without it!  I work in a male dominant community so the door sign and milk tags are great!!  I'd buy this again for myself or to give at a shower!,5
Ikea PATRULL Non-Slip Bath Mat - Green Crocodile,"My little one loves her new bath matt! It's adorable, serves its purpose and it was cheap so I'm happy.",5
DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib Set w/ Full/Twin Size Rail in Honey Oak,"This is the complete set for the DaVinci bed. It includes the parts needed to convert the crib to a toddler bed and to a full size bed. Putting the crib together was easy enough. However, some of the stickers marking the parts were missing - requiring some disassembly once I learn which side I was connecting to. Overall the crib is sturdy and looks nice.",5
"Winnie the Pooh, Pacifier Attacher with Light Green Cord (1 Each)",this worked great for my first child.  but not so well with my second child because my daughter only liked certain pacifers and it will not work on the ones she like because the string can't go through the hole.,5
Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 2 Standard Nipple,My son got upset when eating. After we changed him to level 2 nipples he's back to eating like a champ. These are perfect starting at 3 months until 5 months or so. Then we had to up the levels again.,5
"Regalo My Cot Deluxe Portable Bed, Navy","We love it. We took it camping the day after we got it. She slept peacefully all night!  She now uses it to have &#34;sleepovers&#34; with her sister. Worth the money. Sturdy, great product.",5
"The Peanut Shell Adjustable Sling, Black","I love the pattern, it washes Great! Love the pocket for a burp cloth! My 4 month old 15 lbs, only uses it when he is ready to eat or sleep.Not for when he is awake! It kills my back. Better than nothing,but doesn't help quite enough.Very pretty though!!!",4
The First Years Learning Curve Floating Stars Teether,"These teethers have been a godsend for my daughter.  She started teething very young (we're talking 2 months!) and these were the only teethers I could find that she could fit into her tiny mouth without hurting herself in the process.  The soft plastic seemed to work wonders for her mood!  Once I found these, she became MUCH happier in that she could finally sooth her aching gums.I have two specific comments about them:1) They don't stay cold for very long (which is the only reason why I didn't award the full 5 stars to the product).  This is potentially annoying to the child who's using them, but if you sit close by and help them rotate it so they're sucking on a new/colder spot from time to time it's not so bad.2) They mean what they say on the packaging when they tell you not to freeze them.  On a whim I tried it, just to see what would happen...  The plastic is too soft to withstand that kind of low temperature and it burst.  Oops!Needless to say, I liked it enough to purchase two more after The Explosion (as we've come to call it).  Just don't be stupid like I was or you will end up having to re-purchase!",4
"Gerber Plastic Pants, 18 Months, Fits 24-28 lbs. (4 pairs)",At first they seem really big when you get them but they fit my child perfectly. They have been really useful.,5
"Mam Monsters Silicone Pacifier, Unisex, 6 Plus months, 2 count",It was exactly what it said it was. Nice that they specify so you don't have to worry they might be pink.,5
"Graco Glider LX Gliding Swing, Peyton","This was perhaps the best thing I could buy for myself and my baby.  It has brought me countless hours of peace and relief.  I like the variable speeds, the different songs and noises, and the timer.  She loves to gently glide to sleep for nap time.",5
Rocking Moses Basket Stand Expresso,"The stand works great and looks good. It is lightweight and can easily be carried between rooms. We use it with our Bugaboo Cameleon bassinet and it fits well. It can be rocked with one finger when the parents rest in bed. Only negatives, the instructions aren't the clearest with regard to what side of each piece faces in/out (and thus, may require more than one attempt at having the various pieces face in the right direction). Also, it is held together exclusively with socket head screws tightened with an Allen wrench. The screw sockets wear out quickly, which is unfortunate.",5
Fat Brain Toys Tobbles Neo,We got this for my baby's first birthday and he was SO excited by it - so were his dad and big brother. My only problem with it is that the pieces seem to disappear and so he can't play with it all at the same time very much - but that's probably mostly our fault. We all love playing with it when we can find all the pieces - even the new 1 year old.,4
"Neat Solutions 10 Pack Water Resistant Drooler Bib Set, Multi-color","The smaller size of these bibs worked great for when my son started to drool heavily around three months. The bibs themselves are made of a cheap feeling towel like material with a plastic backing. It's not very absorbant, and I was switching out bibs every two to three hours, but they kept his clothes mostly dry (still had some issues at the neck line), so that was fine.When he got older, I tried to use them as bibs during his eating time as other bibs were still to big. The material got food stuck in it very easily, which made them difficult to clean. They are not very durable as well, as they only stood up to a few washings before the seams came apart. It's good for the price, and did last for three to four months. I would suggest these for anyone looking for small bibs that wouldn't block your kid's arms so they can still play while they drool.",4
Sassy: Baby Food Nursers 4oz - 2pk(Green) [Baby Product],I ordered these for my new granddaughter at my daughter-in-law's request.  The baby took to them right away and it is an easy transition from just formula to adding cereal a bit at a time.  Product cleans easily and works well.  We are all very satisfied with the purchase!,5
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","I love that we didn't have to use tools to mount this onto our stairway. It's easy to open and close, sturdy and great. Highly recommend!",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,"we had a very good experience with this monitor.  it was basically on for 18months continuously before it just quit.  during that time it travelled across the country multiple times, took some bumps, always worked well as an audio monitor.  the screen on parent unit became illegible after about 8-9 months but fundamental function was maintained and the initially somewhat annoying beeping with adjustments actually helped guide it's use.  for the price and long, reliable track record, we'll get another and hope it does the same.we never had the interference or poor sensitivity issues even though we have a wireless router in a complex with many wireless routers.",5
Green Sprouts Organic Cotton Velour Baby Wrist Rattle - Carrot,"I decided to wash this rattle by hand before giving it to my daughter.  I think it said it was safe to go in the washing machine so I assumed that by washing it by hand it wouldn't fall apart.  Well it did.  The side of the carrot split open revealing the fluffing inside, and one of the lines across the carrot unravelled.  Very poorly made!!!",1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock n' Play Sleeper, Yellow","I LOVED this with my son, and cant wait to give it to my new nephew!  Its the BEST sleeper!",5
"Mobi TykeLight Jr, Blue",Provides just the right amount of light for our sons room. We wanted him to be able to see but we didn't want it too bright. This light is perfect for that. And he can hold it and play around with it and he won't hurt himself. It doesn't get hot. I also bought the one on a rechargeable base for his room too.,5
Sleep Tite by Malouf ENCASE Protector - CRIB SIZE - Six-Sided Zipper Encasement - Helps Eliminate Bed Bugs - 100% Waterproof-Eliminates Dust Mites -15 Year Warranty,"Truly satisfied with this product, I purchased this product for my children's mattresses, over others I have tried, I am amazed at how well it works and fit, as soon as I put this cover over the mattress my daughter spilled my fruit punch drink all over the mattress cover and it didn't go through I followed the cleaning instructions and it was like new,",5
Baby Einstein Lights &amp; Melodies Mirror,"I'm taking this product back to the store for a refund.  I am so frustrated with the installation, and I do have a headrest for the middle seat.  I guess I could rig it in some way, but it isn't worth the effort.  It probably wouldn't stay in place anyways.  I bought another mirror for our other car (without all the lights, etc.) and it installed very easily.  I'm also concerned about some of the comments about the plastic colored light covers coming loose as my baby is at the ""reach-grab-and-stick-it-in-my-mouth"" phase!",1
"Carter's Just One You Baby's Mod Flower First Record Book/Baby Book, Pink","I like this book because it goes with theam and has lots on the babys first year, Im not good at writing alot after that and it does go up to 5yrs or so. But as the baby gets older you dont have as much to keep up.PERFECT for me!",3
4moms mamaRoo 005000201 Rocker Bouncer Classic in Silver with Rattle Teether Toy,"~BACKGROUND~I purchased this &#34;swing&#34; as an open box for a really good price for my newborn.  We have been using this now for 5 months.~PROS~- No batteries needed - just plug it in.- Locking adjustable bar that allows the cradle to be positioned anywhere from laying down to sitting upright.- Seating belt is adjustable and secure.- 5 speeds.- 5 motions - Car Ride, Kangaroo, Tree Swing, Rock-A-Bye, Ocean Wave- 5 nature sounds and MP3 plug in capability.- Easy to use LCD display and buttons.- Unique and clean look.- Removable and washable nylon seat.- Mobile with 3 stuffed and designed balls.- Solid, sturdy construction.- Bottom heavy and solid which gives confidence in moving it from one area to another.- Very easy to assemble.- Fairly compact size, especially compared to larger swings.~CONS~- Pricey.- The fully upright position is fairly upright and there is a danger of the baby falling forward.- Due to the nylon material of the seat the upright positioning puts a lot of pressure on the groin area.- Not a traditional swing.  This swing is limited to left to right and up and down motions.- Limited range of motion due to its design.- Sound quality of speakers is not very good.- The fastest speed is still fairly slow, particularly compared to the fastest setting on a traditional swing.~TIPS~Do not leave your child unattended with the swing in its most upright position.  If your child were to lean forward I think he/she may remain stuck in that position.~CONCLUSION~Weighing all of the pros and cons it was worth it especially given the price we paid for it - open box plus 20% off coupon.",4
Carter's Tree Tops Wall Decals,"Very cute, but found that after 1 day, nearly half of these are peeling up on the edges or off the wall entirely. They were also a little tricky to take off the sheet without tearing a few of them. A little worried that the ones by the crib will fall into the crib. I will try to find a way to make them adhere better, but overall not impressed with the quality of this product",2
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Pink","I typically love Summer Infant products, but this was a dud.  I have a wooden kitchen table and could not get the suction cups to stick, thus, the mat moved all over the place-- defeating the purpose.  I even moistened the suction cups as stated by the manufacturer, but it still would not stay in place.  I threw this away and got a refund.",1
North States Supergate Auto-Close Metal Gate,Also a repeat item for me.  First one was good for 6 yrs.  So just reordered as I am painting the room and wanted a new gate.,4
"Dreambaby Sliding Locks, 3 Pack","Bought this item for knobs which did not work at all, but it is great for handled cabinets because it can be closed tightly and doesn't allow room to bang the doors.",4
"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster Car Seat, Midnight Desert Micofiber","After having several boosters, this one is the best by far.  Most of the others on the market seem so flimsy, but this seat is super-sturdy.  It's nice and heavy (in a good way!) and does not tip in the car.  The belt fit is perfect on my son who is 6 1/2 years old, 50 lbs. and 50"" tall.  I see that many people on here have mentioned that the seat will be too narrow as their children grow.  Keep in mind, that as they grow and their torsos get longer, their shoulders will rise above the side wings and you will raise the headrest.  I noticed that many who have complained about that have smaller/shorter children. While it appears that it could be a problem, once you start to raise the headrest, you will see that space appears in between the head wings and side wings.  Remember that the shoulder belt guide should always be above your child's shoulders, not at or below them.  I would highly recommend this seat over any others I have seen and/or tried.",5
CoCaLo Baby Monkey Mania Plush Security Blanket,This is the 4th one i have ordered my son has had meme since he was 6 mon old we got it out of the bedding set then we had to replace it we have lost one and the others get eatin my son love hs so much he take it every where so I have to give him 5 star,5
"Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature Milk Feeding Bib, Pink, 2 Count","My daughter spits up a lot and I love, love, love these bibs!  The ring around the neck keeps the spit up from soaking her and getting in the folds of her neck skin. The terry is so soft and is great for wiping her face. I breastfeed and also love these bibs for when she is nursing to keep dribbled milk from soaking us.. They are cheaper at the baby store though, and frequently on sale (as are all Tommee Tippee items).",5
PRIMO Infant Bath Seat (White),"We used this seat inside of theA Real Cool World Flexibath Bathtub, Whiteand it worked great. I always felt my infants were seated securely in this and never had a fear that they would topple over. I initially thought this would fit in our kitchen sink, but it didn't. Unless you have a large sink without a divider, don't expect it to fit. We were able to use the seat until the girls were 9 months old. Given the price, I'd say it's a great deal.",5
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","These are the best swaddle blankets, ever! They are sooooo soft and are a great color. Target has a Aden + Anais swaddles but they are not bamboo so if you're looking for velvet soft, these will make you very happy.",5

Baby Einstein Bendy Ball,I bought this for my grand daughter who lives in another state.  I sent it directly from Amazon so that saved postage and shipping.  My daughter says it is cute and they played with it numerous times while the little girl was small.  Children outgrow things so quickly but now there is a new baby so it will see use again.  It is well made.,5
"Sozo Lil' Sprinkler Weeblock, Yellow","I got this for a friend, who had stated while changing her newborn he peed on her.  I saw this ACCIDENTALLY, on a site for baby stuff.  Came to Amazon and it was slightly cheaper on Amazon, she loved it!",5
Sliding Closet Door Lock 2-Pack,"At first I loved these and they worked, preventing my two year old from getting in the closet. I'm not sure if it's a design flaw or that now my son can just push the door hard enough for the wings to flatten and the door to slide open. They are still stuck on so that's good but maybe they would be better with a younger child.",2
Kidswitch Light Switch Extender- 3 Pack,"These switches work fantastically for my shorter than average 3 year old, however they cause the switches to be a bit loose which I don't like. Will look at whether different screws may help this situation.On the plus side, our daughter loves being able to turn lights on and off herself.",3
Boon Dive Bath Tub Appliques,"These are so great, the shapes and colors are very imaginative and spark my 2 year old's creativity, he loves sticking them to the wall or the tub or make the submarine chase the shark...or sorting them by color and moving them around, I love the fact that they don't absorb water so hopefully they won't get gross over time with proper cleaning, and my son loves that he can play however he wants with them...makes bath time super creative, I would highly recommend these..we love them",5
Cosco Scenera Convertible Car Seat Black,"Great value, simple to install, my grandson appears to be and says that his is comfortable in it. Not great quality plastic in some places that don't really count.",4
"Made For Mom No Spill Bottle Cap System, Red, 3 Piece","I bought this for our 1 year old to help make it easier to give him different drinks. We are on the road a lot and when we stop at the gas station and get him a bottle of juice, we would have to pour it into a sippy cup so he could drink it, but he would get mad that he couldnt have it in the original bottle even though the other kids could. These tops make it easier to give him the bottles and not have to worry about him being upset and throwing his cup or spilling. Unfortunately, though, these tops are not perfect. They do not stay on very well and they do not fit a lot of bottles, even though they come with 3 adapter rings to help fit them to different bottles. But they still helped and were worth the few bucks we spent on them.",4
"Rockin' 3 pack Baby Leg warmers gift set in green, black, skulls by juDanzy","We opted to purchase the normal sized leg warmers (12inch length) instead of the 'Newborn' size as we want our soon to arrive wee one to be able to grow into these. The quality is superb and the shipping was fast (as well as free as most of the items from JuDanzy qualify for free shipping!) Altogether we purchased seven pairs of leg warmers, though as our wee one grows and we acquire a more ample wardrobe we will be purchasing far more.",5
"Chicco Ct0.6 Capri Lightweight Stroller, Red","Perfect stroller for on the go/travel!!

"Baby Deedee Sleep Nest Lite Baby Sleeping Bag, Heather Gray Lime, Small (0-6 Months)","the jersey fabric is pretty stretchy so my squirmy little guy doesn't seem to mind it as much as other sacks.

"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I read lots of reviews before ordering this tub since mine was getting too small. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!! My baby is 3 months old and the first time I bathed him in it he kicked like a champion swimmer. Then he went to bed and slept for about 9 hours straight!!! That is a rare occasion and a very welcome one. I am now going to bath him every night to see if it works the same :) This tub may not work well for tiny babies, but I could have used it when my baby was 2 months old for sure. It's a keeper.",5

"SwaddleDesigns Marquisette Swaddling Blanket, Elephant &amp; Chickies, Pastel Blue",Great size. Perfect for swaddling or tossing on top of carseat/stroller. Makes for a great gift since swaddling instructions are right on it's silk tag. Love these for summer and their flannel type for winter.,5
"Britax Frontier 85 SICT Booster Seat, Cardinal",The seat is very sturdy comfortable and it looks so safe.  The side impact buffers and high density foam look to protect my child much better than a cheap booster seat.  He also is in a 5 point harness much longer than the cheaper seats.  I ask bought the seat belt guide from britax for this seat for when he is bigger.  I am a Britax fan through and through.,5

"Lansinoh Soothies Gel Pads, 2 Count","I used these with my last child and LOVED them...so wanted to order some more for my next baby, due any day!  They are excellent at relieving any nipple painassociated with breast feeding!  I HIGHLY recommend it item!!!  However I want to bring to your attention that this seller (Prime Medical) does not seem to put the consumer first.First off, the picture that represents the item is completely wrong.  There are not 36 individually wrapped pads.  You get only 2 (I know the description says 2) but just be aware of the difference when you place your order.  When contacted about this, Prime Medical took no responsibility for the difference in item represented. :(Second, although they state Free Shipping on the actual item page...if you live in Alaska or Hawaii, they are misleading their actual price of shipping.  Yes, I should have caught this on my check out page...however I was placing a large order and missed their individual shipping price.  I took their word for it and as stated on the actual item page it says Free Shipping, so I didn't check that closely upon checking out.  I would recommend going to their seller page and reading the fine print of their S/H policies.  I get it, it is my fault for missing the increase in shipping costs. However, a company should stand by their word and honor their initial claim of free shipping...don't you think?Lastly, upon contacting them with the misunderstanding, they were not helpful at all.  To their credit, they did reimburse me about $15 of the $25 shipping rate they charged me. Yep you read that right...they initially charged me $25 to ship a 4oz box. Now they have knocked it down to $10 shipping for a 4 oz box, which is still absurd, and to top it off, they were quite rude on the phone with me.  To Amazon's credit, they cannot control all of their sellers, and I will continue to shop with Amazon (LOVE THEM!), but will never again purchase from Prime Medical.  Buyer Beware...purchase from Prime Medical at your own caution!!",5
"Gund Baby Baa Ba Plush Toy, Lamb","I guess the pic made it seem larger than it was. I read the size but it just didn't sound so small. I totally missed that it has sound, so that makes up for it, I guess. It's for my fiance for Valentine's Day. He collects lambs. They go well next to the zombie killing video game collection.",3
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn",We swaddled our son in the swaddleMes from birth to 3.5 months and then he started rolling so we went looking for an arms out option and found these! It took a long night of him waking up before he got use to having his arms out but I think the transition was much less drastic with the arms out option of still being able to swaddle him...,4
Alva Baby One Size Washable Reusable Cloth Diaper Fit for 6-33lbs Baby (Jeans) Two Inserts J01,Adorable print.  I love Alva's and I will keep buying and using them almost exclusively.  The inserts are huge compared to the M/L Charlie Banana's I was using before I found these.,5
"Gerber Birdseye Diaper Burpcloths, Green, Unisex, 4-Count","They aren't as cute as ones with fun designs, but these are by far the best burpcloths I have found.  I like them because they are larger than the cutesy ones, and they are really absorbent.  I ended up buying a few packs I liked them so much.  The material seems a little stiff when you first open the package but they soften up in the first wash.  The cute little ones just can't handle a lot of spit up and don't quite protect enough area.  These are the best!!",5

Kick Mats - Deluxe Car Seat Back Protectors 2 Pack - Keep Your Car Seats 100% Clean From All The Stains And Scuffmarks Left By The Kids With These Auto-Protective Seat Covers - Designed For Most Vehicles - Protect Your Investment - Lifetime Guarantee,A little difficult to get the bottom straps of these kick mats all the way around my seats to secure them (there was no place for me to attach them at the bottom of my seat)....but this would be a &#34;defect&#34; of my car.  The mats themselves are great and do a good job of keeping my new car clean!,5
"Cosco Juvenile Highback Booster Seat, Girl/Polka Dot Posy","We have had this seat for about 2 years.  It is a good valued seat if you are using the harness.  But we recently installed in the back seat of a truck and since my 4 yr old is over the weight limit for the harness, we wanted to use it as a booster.  That only lasted a few days.  The seat would tip over (with my son in it) every time we made a sharp turn.  The bottom of this seat has narrow, almost like, feet. Also, the seat belt would constantly come out of the wimpy slot that it was supposed to go into. We did everything by the book, but it all kept happening.  So we went and bought another brand (Evenflo) booster that a wider, flat bottom.  It has not happened since.  So just know that this seat works well if anchored down, but not great as a booster with just a seat belt.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This cube is large and heavy so young babies cannot hold it, nor totally grasp the concept...which means that it will not be a toy they will be able to (or even want to) play with independently.  In addition,  the manufacturer's recommended age (6 mos -boy are they trying to pull one over on parents) is extremely too young.  I also think this toy is priced too high.  We've bought large activity tables for less than the cost of this cube that entertain my son longer. If given the choice,  I would not purchase it again unless I found it used and/or substantially cheaper.  Recommended age: 1 yr. and up. Recommended purchase price: $14.99 or less.",3
"Trend Lab Fleece CribWrap Rail Covers for Crib Sides (Set of 2), Pink, Wide","They fit my crib, and were easy to put on. Great quality, worth the money, but I hated the way they looked on the crib so I took them off and returned then.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I got this for my son expecting it to be something he couldn't put down. He sometimes will pick up and mess with it to make the squeaker go off but that's about it. He doesn't use it as a teether. Otherwise its a well made product its just my son doesn't like it.,4
The Baby Dipper Bowl,"I have two of these bowls. My 1 year old does great when he's feeding himself with this bowl. The 2 best things are that it doesn't slide off the table and the food gathers in the sloped corner! MUCH less messy than traditional bowls.I have 3 little boys, so when I'm feeding the baby (7 months) I often need to be able to use only one hand. This bowl makes that possible.",5
"Gerber Birdseye 10 Count 3-Ply Prefold Cloth Diapers, White",I needed some stuffers for my diapers and these worked out great. I wish they were a little thicker but they worked out great just the same.,5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"We like this potty, it's compact, comfortable and easy to clean. But it's really small, so we bought the full size BabyBjorn potty and use this when we are out of the house.",4
"FuzziBunz Wonder Wipes, 10 Pack","As far as wipes go, I don't think I need much as long as I don't have to use more than one wipe at a time.  So these wipes get the job done.  However, they're not very soft, and not very absorbent.  I prefer the Grovia wipes for softness, but so far no wipes I've tried (including the fuzzibunz) seem to hold up in the dryer.  These wipes curl up and pill very badly, and it seems they even get less soft after every wash.  I wouldn't recommend these because basically you're paying a lot for a few cut-up squares of cloth and it's really not worth it.",3
"Britax Roundabout 40 Convertible Car Seat, Aloha",My daughter loves this car seat! Cute fabric and lots of room for her to stretch. It must be the most comfortable and safest car seat around.,5
"Baby AR Pillow - Acid Reflux Pillow Wedge for Babies and Infants - Safely Elevate to a 30 Degree Angle - The Researched, Proven &amp; Best Positioner to Relieve Colic and Acid Reflux","It's really helpful for my daughter. As she suffered after meals, we have to hold her over an hour. But we now hold her for half an hour, and then use this pillow. She thankfully can rest and sleep well for long time. We satisfied this product and appreciate the inventor. And thank you for fast delivery, even though I am in East Asia, I can get this order faster than I expected. I strongly recommend this product to acid reflux children.",5
Safety 1st Prograde No Drill Top Of Door Lock,This is a wonderful way to keep kids from opening doors without drilling into the frame or door.  We rent and are not allowed to drill into our doors.  My husband installed two of these in less than five minutes.  The are simple to use and my three year old cannot get the door open.  Great product and I am glad we bought them.,5

myBaby Soundspa Lullaby Sound Machine and Projector,"I have had a lot of trouble with my infant waking at night & not being able to self-soothe (crying it out didn't work) and once I got this, I kept it on all night, and I could hear him wake up about 4 times, but he'd fall back asleep after a few minutes, and now he completely sleeps through the night, I just put it on a timer for 45 mins and he sleeps about 11hrs now. I would highly recommend this product!",5
"Disney First 5 Years Keepsake Baby Memory Book, A Princess Story","A lot of young moms-to-be today don't think about having a ""baby book"" to document their child's early days...but it is a memory I treasure (I have my grandmother's baby book, my mom's, my own, and my kids').  My children love to look through theirs; and although my daughter did not have one listed in her registry, I thought I would get this as a surprise.  Turned out to be the hit of the shower, and something she (and her daughter) will treasure forever.  Very nice, comprehensive, book...very impressed!",5
Playtex Standard BPA Free Disposable Nurser Liners 4 oz - 100 Count,"Lost a lot of breast milk as it doesnt fit correctly waste of money, they are made for smaller neck bottles as they have a small openings that leak",1
Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib,"Being a first time mom, we'd been using standard terry cloth type bibs even during solid food feedings. We were accumulating stained bibs despite our best efforts to stain-treat them when I remarked to my husband it'd sure be nice if they made waterproof ones we could just rinse off and reuse. Voila! Not only are the Bumkins Waterproof SuperBibs waterproof and machine washable, they are still soft against baby's skin unlike some of the thicker plastic/rubber bibs out there. They are also generously sized so they will fit our little one's neck as she (rapidly) grows, whereas some of her original terry cloth bibs are already too tight.The price is a little high for just 3 bibs but they clean up so quickly and easily you may get by with far fewer than traditional cloth bibs. You literally can rinse off the soiled bib under the tap in your kitchen sink, scrunch it up to wring out any water, lay it out and it'll be dry in an hour or less. And they hold up great in a washer and dryer (we wash them along with the rest of our little one's clothing, gentle cycle, and you don't really need to put them in the dryer.)",5
Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Bottle Newborn Feeding Set,"These bottles are the best! My son is going on one month old and I am strictly breast feeding. We've been using these from the beginning for nights when Dad wants to feed and I am too tired, without any ""nipple confusion."" They also by chance fit myEvenflo Simplygo Manual Breast Pumpperfectly. Even though they have more parts than your plain Jane bottle, they are very simple to assemble (there's only two extra parts for the insert). They come with a small brush to make cleaning easy. We've had absolutely no problem with leaking (as I've experienced with Avent bottles with my niece and nephew). So little air gets through that we can't even get a burp out of him most of the time. I recommend these bottles to everyone! Bonus: They're made in the USA!!! Also boughtDr. Brown's Drying Rackwhich fits all the pieces perfectly!",5
"Chicco Ct0.6 Capri Lightweight Stroller, Red","i bought this as a 2nd (well, really 3rd) stroller for my daughter since she seems to be outgrowing the other umbrella stroller we were previously using. so far shes only rode around in it in the house...daddy has been giving her rides haha..she gets a kick out of it since its just way too cold to go for walks outside. the cost of the stroller is what appealled to us most. some other brands that look basically the same as this one just seem outrageous for a lightweight stroller. so far we love the stroller, but have had some difficulty doing the buckles, they seem a little ""stiff"" (hard to push in and hard to squeeze to get it out. but besides that it is very well built and sturdy. love the 5 point harness since my daughter is now over 2 and thinks its funny to grab onto things such as clothes racks in the mall and not let go!..the 5 point harness eliminates alot of that. so, all in all, a good stroller and would recommend it as a 2nd stroller.",4
4 In 1 Convertible Bassinet - Porter,"Contratry to other reviews, we had no problem assembling this bassinet and all the electronics work well. My 3 week old daughter does enjoy the musical mobile and the vibration mode and the night light comes in handy. It's working well for us as a bedside sleeper and then we roll it into the living area during the day. The drawbacks to this product are the flimsy pad and the lack of well-fitting sheets. We are using cradle sheets by Gerber and they sort of work, but they're a little more loose than I like. I was told that there is an oval bassinet mattress available at BRU, but it was out of stock the one time I went by the store and I have not had time to thoroughly check that out as a special order. There is a readily available mattress at BRU that sort of fits but is a little too small, leaving a gap at the edges.",4
"BreathableBaby CribShield Full Coverage Mesh Liner, White","The ties are too tempting for little sticky beaks,also not enough velcro to adjust to cot snuggly.Good in theory though.Needs to be clearer that it is not for hard ended cots.",1
"C.R. Gibson Memory Book, Baby Bots","I got this for my Daughter-In-Law's shower gift and everyone just loved it.  There is more detail to the cover then can be seen in the picture.  The pages are beautiful and they cover just about everything you want to document in the baby's first years with extra pages in the front and back for pictures and other momentos.  A lot of Mommy and Daddy specific pages so they both can write in it.  I was a little leary ordering it without being able to see the inside, but I am so glad I did.  It is perfect.",5
Custom Baby Girl Bedding - Pink Safari 13 PCS Crib Nursery Bedding Set,My grandson' wife was very happy with the bedding and is busy putting the nursery together before the baby arrives. The seller personalized the pillow with the baby's name and it shipped the very next day after I purchased it. Very nice people to do business with.,5
Graze Organic Lunch Tote - Flowers,I love the fact that my food is not coming into contact with plastic... just organic cotton. They are very roomy and they wash really well. Another brand I purchased had lining and the bags had to be thrown away because I couldn't get the food smells out after washing! These are super cute and I will definitely be purchasing more as gifts.,5
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner, Orange","This brush contours nicely with many different sized/shaped bottles. I also use it to clean breast pump parts. I bought this brush based on previous reviews claiming that it does not spray you with soapy water when washing the bottles. I was excited about this, but unfortunately it was not true for me - still getting sprayed. Overall though, this brush seems more durable than other bottle brushes I have used. The nipple ""brush"" seems pointless to me though.",3
GUND Fuzzy Pink Bear,I was unimpressed when I opened the package and saw a small pink thing in cellophane.  Once I unwrapped it and shook it out - what a cute bear and so soft.  I am very happy with my purchase and so it my new granddaughter.,5
Mommy's Helper Car Seat Sun Shade,"I live in NC where the summer sun is HOT.  My truck is silver and I have tinted windows and even with that the interior of my truck can heat up.  I placed a thermometer in the truck cab and one in the car seat under the Mommy's Helper Car Seat Sun Shade.  The outside temperature was 93 degrees.  My truck was sitting in direct sunlight for hours.  I checked the inside thermometer found in the cab of the truck and it registered 104, I removed the sun shade on the car seat to access the thermometer in the car seat....it REGISTERED 114 degrees!  Actually hotter than the inside of the cab of the truck.  Because my granddaughter is severely handicapped, she cannot let us know that she is ""baking"" in her carseat (radiant heat) ... sure am glad that I did my experiment and I suggest you find another way to keep  the car seat cool.Mommy's Helper Car Seat Sun Shade",1
Simba Baby Rotary Spinning Bottle and Nipple Brush set (BPA Free),"Very similar to born free discontinued brush...very easy to use...the nipple brush is the best, and very handy when it comes to clean breast pump parts",5

"Nuby Precious Moments Printed Comb and Brush, Colors May Vary",I ordered twice with specifications. And they never tried to send me a pink one. It is as if I'm talking or writing to a computer. I originally bought this for my daughter because she desperately needed one. I ended up sending them with my mom to costa rice and amazon send me a completely different one that was chaep crappy quiality they had nothing on babies. I had to end up buying from another local store.,2
"Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 2.8 Inch","We ordered this and love it already. Great product for the price, and we were not disappointed. The range works well as we can sit out on either front or back porch and never loose signal.",5
"Bumkins Waterproof Superbib, Blue Fizz","These are my preferred bibs. They are well cut to fit nicely over the shoulders and around the neck, generous velcro allows for the growing child and a solid tie for the reluctant bib wearer. The feel of the fabric is not too plasticky in texture, the prints are cute and the waterproofing is excellent quality, and they wash and dry and come out like new for years. I have had these bibs through my 3 boys, and they are still in good condition. I just bought my youngest his own design for the fun of changing things up after 4 years.  I highly reccomend this product!",5
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black",We just spent a week at Disney and this stroller was a lifesaver with our 5 month old! I would recommend this stroller to anyone looking for a stroller that can FF or RF....which was our primary reason that we purchased it. You will be happy with the B-Ready!,5

Safety 1st Summit High Back Booster Side Impact Protection Car Seat Yukon,The design was well thought out as it Fits well into my Honda civic. I think it definitely give the most bang for the bucks,4
"Status Roma Glider and Nursing Ottoman, White/Beige",I purchased this for my Granddaughter in-law and my new Great Grandson. I read many good reviews before making the purchase. My grandchildren like it very much. The quality of the chair and ottoman is very good. The only negative thing is the thickness of the cushion. Could be thicker for more comfort during those feedings when baby is so young.,4
Fisher-Price Sounds'n Lights Monitor,"I personally love this. Very little static at all and has a decent enough range for me to do the things that I need to do away from her. Best of all, this thing picks up EVERYTHING. Baby hardly needs to make a sound and this little gadget will pick it up, which gives me peace of mind when I can't be right there next to her and want to make sure I dont miss a THING(accidents only take a second). I feel secure using this monitor to listen to my baby while away. I haven't had any real static problems as long as I follow the very easy to understand directions. Anytime I pick up alot of static all I have to do is change channels and it's fine. Simple to operate as well. Allover I'd recommend it, especially if your on a budget.",4
Medela SoftShells Breast Shells For Sore Nipples,"these breast shells or as medula calls them soft shells are great for inverted nipples. that's nipples that stick in instead of out or are flat, don't stick out more that a bit. they are also use full for sore nipples after breastfeeding these first few days after birth of a baby. always remember if nipples are sore to check the baby's latch and get help in case baby is sucking the nipple instead of taking also the aerola, the tissue surrounding the nipple.",5
Lansinoh Diaper Rash Ointment 3 oz (85 g),"This product caused our 5 month old to have her first allergic reaction.  We have used other diaper rash products, and they cause only minor improvement.  This caused huge red welts and screaming until we got her into a bath to get most of it washed off.  It was absorbed really quickly, so we've still got a pretty bad allergic reaction on our hands.",1
"Foundations Quad Four Child Stroller, Blue",Haven't had a chance to push it full of kids yet but I like it! It fits really easily through doorways and turns well. I was able to put it together myself so assembly is very easy! Great product!! Weight is really not that bad...especially considering it's a 4 seater.,5

Russ Berrie Pregnancy Calendar,"10 years ago I used this for my first daughter, I liked it enough that I bought it again 3 years later for my next daughter! Now here I am 10 years later and I only wanted this calendar because I loved it for my girls! I used it a year ago for my first son and now I am using it for another son to be born soon! I love looking back at all the things I wrote down and that they all have the same calendar! I would recommend this for a nice simple calendar especially for those busy moms!",5
Evenflo Farmyard Mega ExerSaucer,"We wanted a saucer for our 6 month old to ""work"" in while we cooked or ate dinner.  I don't get that excited about the noise & lights factor of other models, so this farmyard version works well, and I'm sure the aquarium version is great too.We had a used saucer for our first child, and it worked well, but we gave it away (needed space).  When we saw that this one was only $59, we decided to buy new.",5
Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey,"My daughter loves this. It's like her security, she holds the monkey sometimes when the pacifier is in her mouth. My sister had one for my nephew and he loved it",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We love Sophie at our house... she is a great teether and a great toy for entertainment.  Our 18 month old still loves her.  She is the perfect size for gripping and holding and biting... she is natural which is great too... and she is SO cute!,5

"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","This is the fourth Britax car seat and second Frontier we've purchased for our two kids. I love the cupholders - we usually use one for a drink and the other to hold a toy or sunglasses. The harness is easy to buckle. The seat is easy to install w/ LATCH (haven't used as booster or alone w/ seatbelt yet). The kids love the cow print which is plush and soft, and we get great comments on it all the time. As a mom, I like knowing they're safe and snug until they reach 85lbs.",5
A Baby Monitor Battery for Graco 2791 / 2795 and Others - 3.6 V 750 mAh - BATT-2795 2791VIB1,This battery fit my baby monitor perfectly.Holds a lengthy charge and was inexpensive compared to anything I could find locally.  It was shrink wrapped and n an envelope so I am sure they save most of the money by eliminating the package.,5
"Baby Aspen Born To Be Snuggle Sack and Hat, Wild Giraffe",Nice,3
Puj Flyte - Compact Infant Bath (White),"Writing this review despite a total lack of time.  This tub is a total waste of money: have to bathe my three-month old daily because of eczema.  I use a gallon of water and one tea-spoon of hydrogen peroxide to desinfect her skin.  Tried the tub for this purpose today.  It only fit three quarts of water.  Ok, I thought.  When I very gently put my 12 pound baby in, of course some water came out through the overflow slots at the edges.  Well, when I gently took the baby out to see how much water was left -- there was no more than a cup of water.  If you would like to bathe your wee one in a cup of water, this may be the tub of choice then... Anything more than that will flow right out through the side slots.  A total waste of money and ridiculously overpiced.",1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My son is 2 1/2 and went through a stage where he was terrified of the dark. His nightlight I used stopped working and I couldn't find anything else that would suit him. I heard about this product from the daycare provider and I'm so glad I ordered it! Every night my son has to have it on the blue setting but I love that there are other color options too. The on and off switch is easy for him to find and he is so proud of being able to do it himself. I also love that there is a timer set on it. We've had it for a while now and haven't had to touch the batteries once. I highly suggest this item!! It's very sturdy and child friendly. As far as him being able to fall asleep with this on, I haven't had any problems with it. He likes to look at his blue stars and falls asleep in no time.",5
"Carters Wrap Me Up Receiving Blanket, 4 Pack, Green","I bought these for a baby shower gift. Even without washing they were very soft to the touch, and the prints are so cute!",5
"Thermos Funtainer Straw Bottle, Little Einsteins, 12 Ounce","For the price, this is a well made and high quality product that every school kid should have for winter.  It will keep the content warm for most of the day.  I bought it for my son in preshool so he can have warm water in the winter.",5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I really liked the idea of the moby wrap, but it isn't that easy to use. I always find myself re-studying the instructions and I still can only figure out how to wear it one way. All the other ways feel like they aren't supportive enough. I also wish it was easier to get out of, its a bit like unwinding yourself from a big ball of yarn. I really like my babybjorn much more.",3
Kawaii Baby Ultra Soft Cross Over One Size Pocket Cloth Diaper with 2 Large Microfiber Inserts &quot; Spring Bud &quot;,"We use primarily pocket diapers with our son.  The majority of our stash is made up of bumgenius diapers, but I also like to try other brands.  You always hear, &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;  I was pleasantly surprised with these diapers.  The inside is lined with a fleece like material (possibly micro fleece) which feels soft for baby.  It comes with nice thick microfiber inserts that fit nicely in the pocket.  I like that at the back of the pocket is a flap to hold the insert in place and make sure the microfiber doesn't touch baby.  I also like how the flaps can cross over to fit on smaller babies.  The only negative on these diapers are that there are 3 snaps to snap on each side unlike the bumgenius' two.  However, this makes it nice to size better on the legs and prevent wing droopage.  If you're wanting a lower cost pocket diaper, I would recommend trying this brand.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I Loved this product. It kept smell to a minimum and could use a regular size trash bag.  Highly  recommend.,5
"Adiri BPA Free Natural Nurser Ultimate Bottle Stage 1 White, Slow Flow (0-3 months)","These would be great except for a few engineering glitches that we found.  First of all you have to tip the bottle upside down to fill it, which means you have to use the lid.  The nipple leaks no matter how tight you fasten the lid.  They also aren't messing around when the say this is a level one nipple, my baby had to work REALLY hard to get milk out.  When you want to check to see how much he is getting, you have to tip the bottle upside down because the measurement is oriented in that manner, so again you're saying breastmilk or formula.  I would like to try the faster flow versions of this bottle but I'm hesitant because of the pain it is to load these in the first place...",3
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","I have four kids, and I've gone through a lot of swings.  This one rates right at the top.  The seat is very comfortable, the swing axis options are very handy, and I love that you can plug it in rather than keep changing the batteries.  You will save $30 easy on batteries over the life of this part.  The only minor negative I can give is that none of our babies liked the rotating mobile (too stimulating) so I just leave that off.  I also rarely use the built in sounds, but occasionally they are handy.  Overall it's the best swing I've used.",5
"3 Sprouts Storage Caddy, Mouse",Adorable tote! Great baby shower gift. Lots of pockets. Great for diaper changing or storing toys or art supplies. Cute design.,5
Fisher-Price Aquarium Monitor,"I am incredibly disappointed in this monitor.  The only good thing about this monitor is the light show.  The reception on the receiver is horrible.  We can't hear our baby unless he's screaming and even then its hard to hear.  Plus all we hear is static.  It doesn't matter what channel its on or where its positioned in the house, static is the only thing that comes through!  I would not recommend this monitor to anyone.",1
"Evenflo Embrace 35 Infant Car Seat Base, Black",This is perfectly compatible with my car seat.  I really like that it has a gage that shows you whether or not the car seat is balanced in the right position.,5
Sesame Street Elmo Car Seat Cover,"Fits my graco carseat ,, easy to remove for washing, somewhat spill proof. Only thing it has no cushioning si u will have to place it over your existing carseat cover.. but it is a great product for the price.",5

"Neat Solutions 10 Pack Water Resistant Drooler Bib Set, Multi-color","The backing of the bibs melted onto itself in the dryer. I had to cut the backing off. Now I am left with a thin piece of terrycloth. Looks like a good deal but you get what you pay for. I gave it one star because you can use them all once, and that's not bad for the price, lol.",2
Kidz Delight Tech Set Trio,I thought these might do more. My 18 month old doesn't even play with them. They are fairly boring in a time where the older siblings are carrying Kindles and Android phones. Not a great distraction like I was hoping.,2
"RayShade&reg; UV Protective Stroller Shade Improves Sun Protection for Strollers, Joggers and Prams Black",I bought this shade because my stroller shade doesn't give enough shade and this shade is easy to attach to my stroller and gives a little extra or alot of shade depending on how you position it. It's great! Easy to use and not very pricey! Wish I had invented it.,5
CNC-KE Taby Tray White,"First thing...HAVE A STROLLER AND CAR SEAT WITH ARM RESTS!!!  If you don't have them then your child can balance the table on their lap, but it will make it more difficult.To let you know my kids are now 15 and 9 and we STILL USE our Tabby Trays for eating in the car...studies, homework, crafts, long car trips...etc.  So its not the disposable item that you may think it is.  Both my kids are great at keeping the tray on their laps...but for toddlers arm rests are a MUST!!For our car seats....we looked for them with arm rests and for our stroller...our Combi fit the bill great, even after we took off the front part!I can not tell you enough how great this item is...every time I went shopping with my daughter (she is the 15 year old now) I put the tray on the stroller and she would play, snack, drink and keep herself very happy while I did the business of being a MOM! I owned the very first generation of these trays and would be stopped in the store by Mom's begging me to provide them the ""WHERE TO GET IT"" info.  They were so hard to find, at first, that I sold them out of my car...ha!  When my daughter was done using the tray or wanted it of...I just used the strap to attach it to the handle on the back of the stroller and kept on going.My son never had a day without the tray and to this day (he is the 9 year old) it saves us many a disaster when eating in the car is a sad fact of life.  With the cup holder, we never loose our drinks and it keeps two kids very happy food and creativity wise for those LONG car trips.  I keep a set (of two) in the trunk of our Honda and a second set (of two) in the back area of my Expedtion.  They take up almost no space upright and we are never without our OPTION for ease of use!!!  Baby Wipes (Huggies Supreme) make clean ups a breeze and the trays are ready for the next time.  If really messy, I take them inside for a quick wash up and put them back in the ready position.Hope this review helps all you mom's think of some LONG TERM USAGE for these great Trays.  Enjoy and LOOK for the car seats (even boosters have them) with ARMS!!!",5
Zoli Baby Sumo Snack Dispenser - 8 oz,"We love this snack container.  Each compartment holds 1 cup of food.  Love that we can take just one section, or 2 or 3, depending on our needs.  The container fits well in the diaper bag, or you can use the handle on the cover to strap it on to the outside of the diaper bag (nice when taking all 3 and a million toys).  Bonus: our son thinks it is the best toy.  =)Only con, sometimes I have difficulty getting the cover to thread on correctly...but it could be the sleep deprivation.",5
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","Only for young fathers because have no door and is difficult to open, you have to jump in with your baby but anyway well made",4
Jolly Jumper Nursing Cover Assorted Colors,I ordered this cover up for my daughter believing you could choose from the various colors. The one I got was BROWN! I was not pleased at all!BB,1
"Simple Wishes D Lite Hands Free Breastpump Bra, Soft Pink, Large to Plus Size","This bra is worth every penny. I purchased this item without realizing how much I actually needed it. To be able to have your hands free is priceless, especially if you are pumping multiple times a day. This seems to be made out of very soft, high quality material, and the price is great. It is very easy to adjust for a snug fit for any size.",5
Postpartum Support Girdle Belt w/zipper Support Belly Band Medical-Grade Compression Bellefit,"I wish I found out about this after my first 3 children!  Before my kids I was Triathlete fit.  Each pregnancy I gained 70lb's.I just had my 4th child in October had have and still use my Bellefit girdles.  I bought a few one for the first few weeks (which I now use swimming and ice skating).  My Abs separation was 5cm and it helped the the gap close.I still have some further recovering to go but I wear mine every day, it's great in the pool there has been no damage to it, it dries fast too which is great.  Washes well as well.The best bit about it for me was that it helped me look after my third child who is handicapped.  His wheelchair is heavy and I wouldn't have dreamed of lifting it without wearing my bellefit garment.",5
Sassy Crib and Floor Mirror,"I bought this for my Granddaughter to use during tummy time. She has begun to look at herself in the mirror. She has not yet reached for the two attached bugs that have crinkle material inside. I have not used it attached to a crib. The only negative is it is too easily knocked over by a rolling baby! I think if, when opened, it was just a little wider in stance it would be better.",4
"BabySmart Cooshee Booster Seat Classic,with Travel Bag, Lime","It is made of dense foam so is comfy. I bought it for the 2-year old, but the 7 year old likes it too.",5
"Bunnies by the Bay Silly Buddy, Emmit","Our son loves to cuddle his bear buddy and finding a wayward paci in his crib or carseat it a cinch, making meltdowns less likely to occur. They hold up really well, we just bought the 2nd Bear because -as first time parents who panicked each time the paci touched ANYTHING-we destroyed the velcro after 6 months! Our 2nd bear is 2 months old and the velcro is fine since we've learned not to unhook the paci every two minutes.These are machine washable, hold up to the dryer and come out as good as new! I love that there are no edges or hard pieces on the silly buddy. There's limited stuffing and no string/ribbons so I never worried about putting our son to bed with his bear.I now purchase a silly buddy for every mom to be I know!",5
3-in-1 Toilet Trainer Potty Toilet Seat,"This is very bad and not stable , Every time my kid sit on it it get displaced and these screws displaced from its place.I don't suggest this product to any one.I want my money back as this is not good product to be on Amazon.At first after collecting all parts together and put it on the toilette I found that it is not fit to it , I have to push it back to fit and the lieder is raised from the ground after that !!!Never buy this product.Last year I bought another product from Amazon like that but it was really excellent one.",1
BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,"This potty is small (good for very little ones) well built, and cleans and empties easily.My son has been emptying it himself since he was two.What more can you really want in a potty?",5
"Carter's Easy Fit Printed Crib Fitted Sheet, Animal",I thought the flowers are more coloring. I know they are white but it doesn't look like flowers from far.  A silly reason I know but other than that I love it it fits perfect the crib mattress..,4
WubbaNub Blue Bear,A wonderful invention! My Grandson holds onto this when he  sleeps and when it slips out of his mouth the paci is longer and he can easily get it back so he dozes right back to sleep. Great purchase!,5
Dex Baby Dura Bib Stage 2 (Danger - Flying Food),"I love these bibs. We bought 3 for my daughter at Wal-Mart several years ago, and they were the only bibs we used after we got them. They catch all the mess and are easy to clean. They are large enough to cover the entire torso, so there is no mess after a finger food meal, or yogurt spills, or whatnot. The back of them did get kind of stained after repeated use which is why I am giving them 4 instead of 5 stars. Additionally, I frequently dried them in the drier on high heat after washing, so after a few years the front of them started to degrade and after my daughter was done with them, we threw them out. That was my fault. Now I am unable to find them in stores and I have been really missing them for my son who has just started feeding himself. There is a big mess all the time, and we basically change his clothes after most meals. I am really happy to have found these online! They cost slightly more than they had when Wal-Mart carried them,, but to me the extra cost is worth it. I am picking up 4. I plan to care for them a little more carefully this time. I will probably not put them in the dryer, and I may hand wash them more than I machine wash. But they should be fine in the machine maybe once a week. Based on my past experience, these should last for many, many years and several kids if I just take a little more effort with them. I saw another tip to wash them with a bit in bleach if the back was holding onto stains, and I will try that too. These bibs are worth it. I have tried other ""washable"" bibs that were thin. They didn't cover as much area, so they didn't catch all the mess, and my son was able to crinkle them up and managed to get food all over himself. They fell apart after one wash. I found the geo line of these bibs and I prefer the design, but wanted to make sure they were the same quality, so I called the manufacturer. All the bibs they make are the same quality, they just carry different lines of design. The only real difference is the size. Dura Bib small (stage 1) is for 3-12 months, all the others are 6+ months.",4
"Boon Benders Adaptable Utensils, Blue Raspberry/Tangerine",Great for toddlers learning how to use utensils for the first time.  I recommend them to all of my mom friends now.,5
Baby Einstein Octoplush,My daughter likes too slam the octoplush around causing it to make noise. I especially love it when she giggles. Didint get a five because it wont keep her interest for too long but its long enough to get a four. This is a toy she continuously plays with.,4
"Vital Baby Super Soft Fruity Hand and Face Wipes, 30 Pack","i have been using the JOhnson and Johnson hand a face wipes for my kids but these smell so much better, i love them, now i wish they sold them in bulk or with subscribe and save so i could stock up :)",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog",This backpack is exactly what I expected and my daughter loves it!! Perfect for little ones because of its size... Great product!!,5
Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Activity Center,"I can't believe other mom's have had such luck with this thing! My daughter get bored SO quickly, and I can see why- most of the toys are for bigger babies, 6 or even 8 months...when I started putting her in the seat at 5 months, she didn't know what to do! I was also frustrated with the lack of imagination or pride taken in designing this product. I really expected more from Baby Einstein, especially since it's a Disney company! The design seems so minimal, with the exception of the arc/turtle/musical buttons section, and the toys honestly don't do anything. The snack tray seems like a cheap way to take up space, too. My daughter has a lot more fun in the exersaucer at her grandma's house, with the toys that can be rotated around, and the light-up book, and other toys that do more than sit there. Two of the &#34;toys&#34; are nothing more than funny shaped plastic loops (probably intended to clip toys onto, but seriously, why not just have toys there already??) I must admit that once she got older, she was more interested in the whale and was better able to bend the clown fish so she could chew on it, but she still couldn't care less about the octopus, or even the musical buttons. Very disappointed.",2
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I ordered this product after reading many of the other reviews, and I'm also pleased with this purchase. My daughter is 10-months-old and her first tooth just came through, and we'd tried everything to soothe her gums: ice cubes, teething rings, cold washcloths, you name it. At first she wasn't terribly interested in the toy, but then I took it and put it in my mouth and handed it back to her. She put it in her mouth, and I squeezed the other side to make it vibrate. The look on her face was priceless! Her eyebrows went up and I noticed she bit down harder (so I could let go), and she seemed to really like the vibration. This has since become her go-to toy when her gums seem to bother her. Also, I discovered she likes to have the little roller on the handle rubbed up and down her back. All in all this is a really well made toy that worked for my daughter exactly how I'd hoped.",5
"Sleepy Wrap Classic Wrap Baby Carrier, Dark Pink, 0-18 Months",The Sleepy Wrap is an excellent choice for carrying newborns and small babies in my opinion- and so nice for nursing discreetly! The fabric is light and breathable- pure comfort for both Mom & Baby. There are so many benefits to wearing baby close.StephanieAdventures In Babywearing[...],5
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Feeding Bottle, Polypropylene 2-ounce, 2 Pack",These are the perfect size for a newborn baby. My baby was drinking about an ounce at a time when she was 1st born and these were the best bottles! I used Dr. Browns bottles with my son too. After spending a lot of money on other bottles that he hated I learned my lesson and I'll never buy another brand again!,5
"Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman, White/Beige",Very pleased with this item. Well made and was very easy to assemble. Wish I had a choice of wood finish.,4
Susen 1pc Fashion Cute Baby Kids Girls Boys Stretchy Warm Winter Panda Cap Hat Beanie (Hot Pink),"It was pretty big for my infant daughter's head, but it fit my wife's head quite well. I suppose she'll have to grow into it.",4
Disney Pixar Wall E: Lunch Tote Box w/ Water Bottle,"The lunchbox seemed ok.  It had an odor to it, but it may need to just be aired out.  I did get it in a timely fashion.  My grandson liked it, but I think the cost was a little bit more than I wanted to spend.  Thank-you.",3
"Moonbeam Mini Projector Solar Powered Nightlight, Blue","Loved this light when it lit up at dusk, was broken hearted when it failed to stay on less than an hour later.  It either won't hold a charge or has faulty wiring as it turns on and off with the extra battery in place.  After desperately trying to get it to come back on and stay on (have a hyper-active child that is afraid of the dark) I've given up and ordered a replacement, will let you know how it goes the second time around.  However, I am REALLY put off that I paid for overnight shipping, received a product that won't work, and now will have to wait three more days for it's replacement.  Not happy at all.",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Deluxe Auto Mirror,"This mirror is the greatest invention ever! It is the one thing that managed to keep my baby content in the car. It is also easy for me to check on him.One problem though, when I first purchased it, the remote did not work, so I contacted Fisher Price and they kindly sent me a brand new mirror with a new remote! So if you are having problems with yours contact the company.",4
"Storksak Strollerclips, Black",Very easy to use with my Storsak bag and Britax B-Agile Stroller. So far they seem to be well made and will last a long time.,5
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,"This is really good if you can apply it correctly without too many adjustments. I had to peel back part of it (2 or 3 inches) in a couple of places and now it doesn't stick anymore. So, if you have two people doing it together and you take your time the product will adhere well and should work as advertised. Also, I would buy this and apply it at the first sign your baby starts to gnaw or slobber on the rail. Our black crib now has some spots that are missing paint and finally we decided to buy this and ever since things have been great.",3
"Tivoli Couture Classic Memory Foam Stroller Liner, Flamingo Pink","While the cushion was very soft and thick, the width of the back was not enough for me (Britax B-Agile). I wanted a little more coverage to the side because my baby's skin is very sensitive and is irritated by the material on the stroller.The cover on the foam cushion is also very soft and gentle on skin. The color was spot on for my red Britax! The cut outs for the stroller harness were perfect. A great product, just not the right size for me (the Skip Hop seems wider, I'm going to try that next).",4
Disney Pixar Cars McQueen Team 3 piece Feeding Set Navy White One Size,Item arrived in pieces.  Cute piece but ended up in the garbage.  Waste of my money and time.  Better luck wished on those who purchase this going forward,1
Born Free Twister Brushes,"Love the swivel handle and the nipple brush. Also, this does not scratch plastic bottles. Tried a few different things in the beginning, because these were hard to find in stores. Easist to just get what I want for a better price on Amazon and have it delivered free, rather than go hunting around many stores with a baby. For a busy mom, I love the product, and the Amazon service...",5
"Zolowear Cotton Baby Sling Sage, Small","This item is just as beautiful as it looked in the photo and the fabric is so nice and soft.  It takes a little practice to get used to, but that is what you would expect with these ring slings.  My only issue is that I sized for a small, which is more expensive (oddly enough) so I went ahead and ordered a medium.  I feared it would be too large but it is not at all.  It fits for working order just fine but the tail is not as long as pictured and I would like it to be.  In hind sight I would have ordered a large to get that extra tail for attractiveness as well as to be a better cover when breastfeeding.  (I read on other sights that the sizing mostly affects the tail length, not the fit or safety).",5
"Extra Large 40&quot;x30&quot; Absorbent Hooded Towel, Solid Blue with Swirl Print, Frenchie Mini Couture","After reading some of the previous reviews, I was a little skeptical to buy this towel, but I decided to try it anyways. I love it! It has not shed at all on my son and it's the perfect size for him! (He's 17 months). And even after a few washes it has remained soft! I would definitely recommend this towel for your younger toddler!",4
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"I was very excited to receive this monitor and when we got done with the charging for 18hrs and got ready to use it, it was horrible we could not see any picture all we got out of it was sound. Save you Money!",2
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, White, Mesh","Very useful, easy to use... we used it a lot. Recommended 100% to everyone!!!!!! Bjorn is a great brand .",5
Boppy Luxe Designer Pillow In Rosebud,I recieved this as a shower gift and I wish I would have took it back.  I hated it for nursing and ended up buying the My Brest Friend pillow which gives much more support.  It may come in handy later when my baby is older when she is on her tummy or sitting up.,2
Wood Paw Print D&Eacute;cor Pet Gate Black,"It does exactly what it's supposed to and looks very nice doing so, I would buy again if I needed more",5
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,"What a great product!  Less air bubbles than shaking a bottle to mix formula and water.  Baby is still fussy, but every baby burps anyway.  A real time saver as I make several bottles after dinner for the night feedings and next day. Easy to clean and very easy to use.",5
NO DAVID PLUSH DOLL Character by David Shannon,"Well, It is advertised as 8 inches, so customers should expect that.  Cute, looks like book character, price a bit steep.",4
"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","My husband and I went to a baby store and tried many different strollers. I was starting to get concerned because they were all by cumbersome. I'm also 5'3&#34;, I think, an average height but I had such a hard time lifting all the collapsed strollers. I knew I would have a difficult time lifting it into my SUV. Until I saw this stroller.In the world of strolls, this one is light as a feather but extremely sturdy. I'm able to lift and fold this with one hand.  After my baby was born and I started using it, I was wheeling my friend's stroller for her and I didn't realize how smooth mine was until I tried someone else's stroller. I also get a lot of compliments from complete strangers on how the stroller looks really nice.The only con I have is that you have to buy a lot of accessories that are usually standard in most strollers. For example, we had to buy the snack tray and cup holders separately.You won't regret buying this!  It's a little bit more than your average stroll but it's worth it!",5
"Boba 3G Baby Carrier, Montenegro Black",The quality of Boba 3G is amazing. Colors are so beautiful. The excess straps role up so they're not just hanging. The sleeping hood is detatchable and it tucks nicely in one of the zippered pockets. Theres also a pocket that fits a cell phone and keys or whatever. My 18 lb 8 month old is in it all the time. My 3 yr old rode on my hubbys back for a couple hrs at the zoo and the weight distribution makes this carrier so comfortable. Also unlike the other expensive carriers this ones waist roles up and snaps so it can accomodate a newborn at 7 lbs. To 45 lbs. Yes. LOVE IT! Oh and this seller shipped it out fast;-),5
"Britax Marathon 70 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","We bought the Britax Marathon to keep the Little One safe and rear-facing for a little while longer.  She's 18 months old and outgrew her infant car seat.  Our car is tiny ('93 accord) so I was half expecting we'd have to return it, but it actually fits better than our infant car seat!  We have this in the middle seat in the back and both front seats can slide all the way back and have a little bit of recline room!  I wish we had bought this a long time ago.  Our Little One doesn't love to be in the car and screams a lot of the way to visit the grandparents (an hour away), but with how high the Marathon sits her she can see cars and busses passing and is quite content.  I love this car seat.One complaint is that the straps twist pretty easily getting her in and out, but it's not that hard to fix.",5
"Dr. Brown's Designed To Nourish My Dot Storage Labels, 72-Count, Colors May Vary","As other reviewers have said, these are perfect for labeling bottles and food for daycare. They go on clean and come off without a trace. They are not damaged at all by warm water, so the daycare ladies can water-warm bottles without turning the lable into gooey mush. Use a fine-tip sharpie to write on them. Only small complaint is that the color on the lower half of all the labels should be lighter. I find myself using up all the lighter colors because it is harder to read anything you write on the lower half of the darker labels. Price seems OK given my high level of satisfaction. 4.5 stars.",5
Baby Einstein Octoplush,"So I was looking for a really good toy for my 4 month old, and believed all the great reviews I read here. I could not be more disappointed with what arrived. I thought the fabric would be soft, maybe velour. Instead is it some horrible scratchy artificial fabric. The head of the octopus contains a big heavy sound box with a horrible velcro flap on the back to let you change the languages etc. But it means that the head is not at all soft to hug (almost heavy and hard enough to bruise, not to mention scratchy). It is so heavy, the thing won't even sit up without falling over. Finally, it is not really very well made - the images on the tentacles are not centered properly, and the buttons within the tentacles are small and difficult to find - how is my baby supposed to hit those!?! Come to think of it, the music isn't very inspired either.Maybe this is now being manufactured from cheaper materials? Is Baby Einstein that hard up?",1
